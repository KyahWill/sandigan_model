<p class="BODY">The facts from the records are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal litigants in this case are the
successors-in-interest of Jose Velasquez, Sr. who died intestate on <st1:date year="1961" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1961</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> is the surviving spouse of Jose Velasquez, Sr.
and the other 13 petitioners are their children namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flora, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span>, Julio, Benjamin, Rodolfo, Alfredo, Napoleon,
Manuel, Elena, <st1:place><st1:city>Patricia</st1:city>, <st1:state>Victoria</st1:state></st1:place>
and Carlos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
private respondents are the descendants of Jose Velasquez, Sr. with his first
wife <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real who died in 1920 at <st1:city><st1:place>Santa
  Cruz</st1:place></st1:city>, Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents Jose Velasquez, Jr. (substituted after his death
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this suit by his surviving
spouse Teresa <span class="SpellE">Magtibay</span> and their children Ricardo,
Lourdes, Celia and Aida), and Lourdes Velasquez are two of the five children of
Jose Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other three, Amelia, Guillermo and <span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span>, all surnamed Velasquez, all died before the
commencement of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amelia
Velasquez died without any issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Guillermo Velasquez was survived by private respondents <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>, Lolita, Minerva, Cynthia and Jennifer, all
surnamed Velasquez, his children, forced heirs and lawful successors-in-Â­interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lutgarda</span> Velasquez
was survived by private respondents Cesar, Adolfo, Evelyn, <span class="SpellE">Amelita</span>,
Ruben and <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span>, all surnamed Gonzales, likewise
her children, forced heirs and successors-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was judicially instituted by the private respondents
against the petitioners in 1969 in a complaint entitled "<span class="SpellE">accion</span> <span class="SpellE">reivindicatoria</span>, annulment
of deeds of sale, partition and damages." However, both the trial and the
appellate courts considered that the real controversy in this case is the
liquidation of the conjugal partnership properties acquired by the deceased
Jose Velasquez, Sr. in his two marriages, one with <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
Real, who predeceased him, and the other with <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>, as well as the partition of the estate of
said Jose Velasquez, Sr. among his heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
Real in 1920, <span style="">no </span>dissolution of
the first conjugal property has been made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, Jose Velasquez, Sr. enjoyed full possession, use, usufruct
and administration of the whole conjugal property of the first marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1930, Jose Velasquez, Sr. took <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> as his second wife although they
cohabited as early as 1921, when she was 16, soon after his first wife's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this marriage, the other 13
co-petitioners were born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither had
there been any liquidation of the second conjugal partnership after the death
of Jose Velasquez, Sr. in 1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
situation gave rise to the controversies in the instant case spawned by the
parties' conflicting claims from both sides of the two marriages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court appointed two sets of commissioners-one on
January 31, 1975, for the purpose of making an inventory of the estate of Jose
Velasquez, Sr., and the other on November 15, 1976, to determine which of the
parcels of land listed in such inventory submitted by the first set of
commissioners belong to the conjugal partnership of the first marriage or to
the conjugal partnership of the second marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the Report and Inventory submitted on <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1975</st1:date>, the commissioners
listed the following properties as acquired by the late Jose Velasquez, Sr.
during his marriage with <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real:</p>

Lot 2-A West Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and the house
thereon of the Inventory submitted by the first set of commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refuse to make findings as to the nature

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed to the respondent Intermediate Appellate

<p class="BODY">On February 7, 1985, the Intermediate Appellate Court, Third

the entire house and lot in West Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records and the arguments presented
by both parties, the Court finds that both the trial court and the respondent
Intermediate Appellate Court failed to consider some basic principles observed
in the law on succession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
oversight renders the appealed decision defective and hard to sustain.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic rule that before any conclusion about the legal
share due to the heirs may be reached, it is necessary that certain steps be
taken first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the assailed decision,
the respondent court affirmed the trial court's ruling, that Jose Velasquez,
Sr. had already disposed of and exhausted his corresponding share in the
conjugal partnership owned by him and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real,
so that his heirs have nothing more to inherit from him, and that accordingly,
whatever remaining portion of the conjugal property must necessarily appertain
only to the private respondents as heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
Real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the trial court failed to
consider among others, the following provisions of the Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 908.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To determine
the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>, the value of the property left at the
death of the testator shall be considered, deducting all debts and charges,
which shall not include those imposed in the will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To the net value of the hereditary estate, shall be added the
value of all donations by the testator that are subject to collation, at the
time he made them."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ART. 1061. Every compulsory heir, who succeeds with other
compulsory heirs, must bring into the mass of the estate any property or right
which he may have received from the decedent, during the lifetime of the latter,
by way of donation, or any other gratuitous title, in order that it may be
computed in the determination of the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of each
heir, and in the account of the partition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is undeniable that numerous donations <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span> were made by Jose Velasquez,
Sr. in favor of some of his compulsory heirs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They include among others, the donation made in favor of Guillermo
Velasquez on February 26, 1953, consisting of 403,000 square meters (Items 5
and 6); the donation made in 1926 in favor of Jose Velasquez, Jr., consisting
of 450,000 square meters (Item No. 18); the donation in favor of Amelia
Velasquez (Item No. 27); and the donation in favor of <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>, consisting of 11,000 square meters
(part of Item No. 29) (Commissioner's Report, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 355-360).</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that there was no determination whatsoever of the
gross value of the conjugal properties of Jose Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, it is impossible to determine the conjugal share of Jose
Velasquez, Sr. from the said property relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, no collation of the donations he
executed during his lifetime was undertaken by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it would be extremely difficult to
ascertain whether or not such donations trenched on the heirs' <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> so that the same may be considered subject to
reduction for being <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 909 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 909.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Donations
given to children shall be charged to their <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Donations made to strangers shall be charged to that part of
the estate of which the testator could have disposed by his last will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Insofar as they may be <span class="SpellE">inofficious</span>
or may exceed the disposable portion, they shall be reduced according to the
rules established by this Code."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the avowed specific provisions of the aforesaid laws
respecting collation, which are ruled controlling even in intestate succession,
this Court finds that the lower court's ruling adjudicating the remaining
portion of the conjugal estate to the private respondents is purely speculative
and conjectural.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relative to the sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> to the spouses Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Santos;
the resale of the same property to her; and the subsequent deeds of assignment
she executed in favor of her children, the trial court had clearly established
that <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>
employed fraudulent acts to acquire title over the said properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the trial <span class="GramE">court, as
well as the respondent court are</span> correct in ruling that the said sales
and assignments are null and void, sham and fictitious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent portion of the trial court's decision reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence adduced by the parties during the hearing
before this Court and before the Commissioners, these properties were acquired
on November 19, 1918 by the spouses Jose Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span>
Real from <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Balasoto</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">H-5, Commissioner).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said property was originally declared for
taxation purposes in the names of said spouses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">H?Commissioner).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On March 4, 1967, defendant <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> sold the same property to the <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> Santos and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">H-1-Commissioner).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vendee Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>
is the sister of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Subsequently, Tax Declaration No. 4843 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
H-2-Commissioner) was issued in the names of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
Santos and Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> resold (sic) the
same property to <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">H-3-Commissioner).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, tax declaration covering said
property was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> (Exhibit H-4- Commissioner).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this suit, this property was subdivided and assigned by <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> in favor of her children, the defendants
Flora, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patrocinio</span>,
Benjamin, Rodolfo, Alfredo, Napoleon, Manuel, Elena, Patricia, Julio, Victoria
and Carlos, all surnamed Velasquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
defendants-children of <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span>
caused the issuance of free patent titles in their favor covering the
subdivided lots conveyed to them respectively by their mother (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2, 2-A to 2-L).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is evident that the parcels of land under Items 7 and 8 of
the Inventory belonged to the conjugal partnership of the spouses Jose
Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Canuta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkatipunan</span> had no right to alienate the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her conveyance of the same property to her
brother-in-law and sister is fictitious or simulated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten (10) days after she executed her sale,
the same property was resold to her by the vendees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She utilized said conveyance and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> only for the purpose of securing a tax
declaration in her name over said property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her subsequent subdivision of said lot and transfer of the subdivided
lots to each of her children further show her fraudulent intent to deprive the
plaintiffs of their rightful shares in the disputed property." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 606-607)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite the several pleadings filed by the petitioners in this
Court, they did not rebut the foregoing findings of the trial court but merely
held on to their argument that since Free Patent Titles Nos. P-2000 to P-2012
were already issued in their names, their title thereto is indefeasible and
incontrovertible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a misplaced
argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that they had succeeded in securing title over the said
parcels of land does not warrant the reversal of the trial court's ruling that
the above mentioned sales and assignments were sham and fictitious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Torrens title does not furnish a shield for
fraud notwithstanding the long-standing rule that registration is a
constructive notice of title binding upon the whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal principle is that if the
registration of the land is fraudulent and the person in whose name the land is
registered thus holds it as a mere trustee, the real owner is entitled to file
an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property within a
period of ten years (<span class="SpellE">Pajarillo</span> v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, G.R. No. 72908, August 11, 1969, 176 SCRA 340).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioners asserted claims of exclusive ownership over the
said parcels of <span style="">land </span>but acted
in fraud of the private respondents, the former may be held to act as trustees
for the benefit of the latter, pursuant to the provision of Article 1456 of the
Civil Code:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1456<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If</span> property is acquired through mistake or fraud, the person
obtaining it is, by force of law, considered a trustee of an implied trust for
the benefit of the person from whom the property comes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But while the trial court has the authority to order the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the questioned titles, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot agree that the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> should be made in
favor of the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is that it is still unproven whether or not the private respondents are
the only ones entitled to the conjugal properties of Jose Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is to be noted that as the lawful heirs of Jose Velasquez, Sr. the herein
petitioners are also entitled to participate in his conjugal share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> said
property in favor of the private respondents alone would not only be improper
but will also make the situation more complicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are still things to be done before the
legal share <span style="">of </span>all the heirs can
be properly adjudicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relative to the last assignment of error, We find the ruling made
by the respondent appellate court proper and in accord with law insofar as it
adjudicated the one-half (1/2) portion of the house and lot situated at West
Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, as belonging to the petitioners
to the extent of their respective proportional contributions, and the other
half to the conjugal partnership of Jose Velasquez, Sr. and <span class="SpellE">Canuta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paqkatipunan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We must modify it, however, as it readily partitioned the conjugal share
of Jose Velasquez, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(1/2 of the conjugal property or 1/4 of the entire house and lot)
to his 18 heirs.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As already <span class="GramE">said, no conclusion as to the legal
share due to the compulsory heirs can be reached in this case without (1)
determining first the net value of the estate of Jose Velasquez, Sr.</span>;
(2) collating all the donations <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>
