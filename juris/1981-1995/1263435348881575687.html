filed a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of Makati against the spouses
Josephine Anne Ramnani and Bhagwan Ramnani for the collection <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>a sum of money representing the

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1991, Bhagwan Ramnani filed a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
before the respondent Court of Appeals imputing error to the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>(1)  in denying the motion
to lift order declaring petitioner as in default despite a clear showing of a
meritorious defense;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  in not considering
petitioner's reason for failure to attend pre-trial as excusable neglect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision
dated May 10, 1991, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, holding that <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
was not the proper remedy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court said:</p>

<blockquote>Petitioners alleged that the respondent court erred and committed
grave abuse of discretion and/or acted in excess of jurisdiction in assigning
its Branch Clerk of Court as the hearing commissioner for the purpose of the <u>ex</u>
<u>parte</u> reception of plaintiffs' evidence (par. 19, Petition); that the
questioned Decision failed to specify whether defendants are solidarily or only
jointly liable (par. 20, Petition); and that petitioner had a valid and
meritorious defense (par. 21, Petition).  These are matters that could very well be ventilated in an ordinary
appeal.  It should be stressed that the
writ of <i><u>certiorari</u></i> issues for the correction of errors of
jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction.  It cannot be legally used
for any other purpose (Silverio vs. Court of Appeals, 141 SCRA 527).  Mere error of judgment cannot be a proper
subject of the special civil action for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> (Zapata vs.
NLRC, 175 SCRA 56).  Further, it is a
settled rule that <i><u>certiorari</u></i> cannot be made a substitute for and
perform the function of an appeal (People vs. Cuaresma, 172 SCRA 415).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has come to this Court to challenge that
decision.  He avers that the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>Appeals erred in upholding the
refusal of the trial court to set aside the order of default and the default
judgment thereafter issued.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The basic rule is found in Section 2, Rule 20, <u>viz</u>:
"A party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be non-suited
or considered as in default."</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in Lina v. Court of Appeals,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the remedies available to a defendant in the regional trial court who has been
declared in default are:</p>

<blockquote>a)  The defendant in default
may, at any time after discovery thereof and before judgment, file a motion,
under oath, to set aside the order of default on the ground that his failure to
answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or excusable neglect, and that he
has a meritorious defense; (Sec. 3, Rule 18)</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)  If the judgment has
already been rendered when the defendant discovered the default, but before the
same has become final and executory, he may file a motion for new trial under
Section 1(a) of Rule 37;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c)  If the defendant
discovered the default after the judgment has become final and executory, he
may file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>petition for relief
under Section 2 of Rule 38; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>d)  He may also appeal from
the judgment rendered against him as contrary to the evidence or to the law,
even if no petition to set aside the order of default has been presented by
him.  (Sec. 2, Rule 41)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first remedy was adopted by the petitioner but his motion to
lift the order of default was denied.  According to the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>Defendants' non-appearance is inÂ­excusable.  It is unbelievable their former lawyer did
not explain to them the mandatory character of their appearance.  Their invocation of the deteriorating health
of defendant Josephine necessitating her trip abroad for appropriate medical
treatment, is unavailing.  There is no
medical certificate to attest such illness.  Besides, at the time of the hearing of the motion on October 19, 1990,
counsel for the defendants admitted that Josephine had not yet arrived from the
States, despite their averment in their motion she would "only be back
late September or early October of this year." This only indicates her
light regard of her duty to appear in court.  Moreover, the other defendant Bhagwan Ramnani did not submit any other
plausible explanation for his absence in the pre-trial.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A satisfactory showing by the movant of the existence of fraud,
accident, mistake or excusable neglect is an indispensable requirement for the
setting aside of a judgment of default or the order of default.  After going over the pleadings of the
parties and the decision of the respondent court, we find that the motion to
lift the order of default was properly denied for non-compliance with this
requirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants were less than conscientious in defending
themselves and protecting their rights before the trial court.  They did not pay proper attention and
respect to its directive.  The
petitioner has not shown that his and his wife's failure to attend the
pre-trial hearing as required was due to excusable neglect, much less to fraud,
accident or mistake.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner insists, however, that they had a meritorious
defense which the trial court should not have disregarded.  A meritorious defense is only one of the two
conditions.  Even if it be assumed for
the sake of argument that the private respondents did owe Josephine Ramnani
P900,000, as alleged in the counterclaim, that circumstance alone is not
sufficient to justify the lifting of the order of default and the default judgment.  The obvious reason is that a meritorious
defense must <u>concur</u> with the satisfactory reason for the non-appearance
of the defaulted party.  There is no
such reason in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appropriate remedy is an ordinary appeal under Section 2 of
Rule 41 of the Rules of Court providing in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>A party who has been declared in default may likewise appeal from
the judgment rendered against him as contrary to the evidence or to the law,
even if no petition for relief to set aside the order of default has been
presented by him in accordance with Rule 38.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In questioning the dismissal of its petition by the respondent
court, the petitioner invokes the case of Pioneer Insurance and Surety
Corporation v. Hontanosas,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court sustained the challenge to an order of default in a petition
for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> rather than in an ordinary appeal, which was held
as not an adequate remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">That case is not<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>applicable
to the present petition.  <i><u>Certiorari</u></i>
was allowed in that case because the petitioner was <u>illegally</u> declared
in default.  The Court held that, first,
the petitioner could not be compelled to attend an unnecessary second pre-trial
after it had indicated at the earlier pre-trial that there was no possibility
of an amicable settlement; second, the pre-trial was premature because the last
pleading had not yet been filed at the time; and third, there was insufficient
notice of the pre-trial to the petitioner.  In the case at bar, no such irregularities in the pre-trial have been
alleged by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we held in Pure Foods Corporation v. NLRC:<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>It must emphatically be reiterated, since so often is it
overlooked, that the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is a remedy
designed for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of
judgment.  The reason for the rule is
simple.  When a court exercises its
jurisdiction, an error committed while so engaged does not deprive it of the
jurisdiction being exercised when the error is committed.  If it did, every error committed by a court
would deprive it of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment would be a
void judgment.  This cannot be
allowed.  The administration of justice
would not survive such a rule.  Consequently, an error of judgment that the court may commit in the
exercise of its jurisdiction is not correctible through the original civil
action of <i>certiorari</i>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even on the supposition that <i><u>certiorari</u></i> was an
appropriate remedy, the petition would still fail because it has not been
clearly shown that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in
refusing to set aside the default order and the default judgment.  We have held in many cases, including
Pahilanga v. Luna,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
that:</p>

<blockquote>It is within the sound discretion of the court to set aside an order
of default and to permit a defendant to file his answer and to be heard on the
merits even after the reglementary period for the filing of the answer has
expired, but it is not error, or an abuse of discretion, on the part of the
court to refuse to set aside its order of default and to refuse to accept the
answer where it finds no justifiable reason for the delay in the filing of the
answer.  In motions for reconsideration
of an order of default, the moving party has the burden of showing such diligence
as would justify his being excused from not filing the answer within the
reglementary period as provided by the Rules of Court, otherwise, these
guidelines for an orderly and expeditious procedure would be rendered
meaningless.  Unless it is shown clearly
that a party has justifiable reason for the delay the court will not ordinarily
exercise its discretion in his favor.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above doctrine is applicable to the inexcusable neglect of
the herein petitioner and his wife to appear at the pre-trial hearing duly
scheduled and of which they were properly notified.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must, however, moderate the award of damages by the trial
court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as we feel </span>it is rather
harsh upon the petitioner.  In the
exercise of our discretion, we hereby reduce the moral damages to P20,000.00
and the attorney's fees to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">P10,000.00, </span>and
disallow the exemplary damages.  The
rest of the award is approved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the challenged decision is AFFIRMED as above
modified, with costs against the petitioner.  It is so ordered.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
