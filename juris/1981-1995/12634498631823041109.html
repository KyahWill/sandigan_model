Castro, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> and Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista killed Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cabilaoan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that they killed Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> at the
instance of the accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> who pro­mised them a reward of P1,000.00 after
killing Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to this witness it all began one
late afternoon in January, 1966, when he and the accused Julian Aguilar and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> were together,
walking in a barrio road of <span class="SpellE">Inamotan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, which
adjoins barrio <span class="SpellE">Caman­tiles</span> of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, the four other accused, <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
and Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista arrived and approached
the witness and his compa­nions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayo­yong</span>
greeted them by saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'So you are
here.' In that occasion, <span class="SpellE">Westri­mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> proposed to them to kill Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, Bo. Captain of <span class="SpellE">Cabilaoan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, offer­ing to
pay them P<span style="">1,000.00 </span>if they
succeeded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said witness declared
that in the conversations that day, the accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> and Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista did most of the talking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Knowing that the proposal was a bad one, the witness said that he and
his companions did not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
they separated, however, <span class="SpellE">Westri­mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> allegedly told the wit­ness and his two
companions to think it over and to be at the same place on another day to give
their decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The witness and his two companions went to the same place on
the designated day and there they met again their four co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Altho</span> the proposal
was renewed, the witness and his companions did not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the latter were told to be at the same
place on another day designated for them to talk over the proposal some
more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this third meeting when the
witness and his com­panions hesitated to agree to the pro­posal of <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>, the
accused Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista forced them to
accept the said proposal by threatening them with bodily harm if they did not
agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before they parted the witness
and his companions were told to meet with their co-accused once more so that
they would know the other details of their plan to kill Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, about
three days before the execution of their agreement, all the accused met on the
same place and the witness and his companions were told to gather in the house
of the accused <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>
in the afternoon of January 21, 1969 (sic), where the other accused would meet
them.</blockquote>

passed for the witness and, together, they went to the house of the accused <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Barrientos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
they arrived there <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>
told them that their co-conspirators were not yet in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, however, the accused <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
and Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven

way they stopped by a small store owned by a certain <span class="SpellE">Sito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Escritor</span> where Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista bought four bottles of wine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There they drank three of the four bottles and moved on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way they met the accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> who
reminded them that if they succeeded in killing Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
he would pay them <span style="">P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>When they reached the house of Antonio
'<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista the latter served them dinner and
let them drink the fourth bottle of wine which was left of the four bottles
they got from the store of <span class="SpellE">Sito</span> <span class="SpellE">Escritor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista told them that it was time to go.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They proceeded to Bo. <span class="SpellE">Cabilaoan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a certain point in the barrio road of <span class="SpellE">Cabilaoan</span> Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista stopped them and told them that there they would wait for their
intended victim, Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time was between eight and <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time> that night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"They sat by the road side and waited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About two and a half hours later, they saw a
man riding on a bicycle with lights coming down the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista stopped him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man was
Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, their intended victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista held him by <span style="">pointing </span>a
gun at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he thrust a bamboo club
to <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and
ordered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Club him.' Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> pleaded for his life saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Please do not kill me for the sake of my
children.' <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>
hesitated but because he feared <span style="">Antonio
</span>'<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista, he got the bamboo club and
struck Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> at the back of the lat­ter's
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim was thrown towards
Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista and grappled with the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>’
Bautista ordered his compa­nions to held him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> went behind the victim and held
him by the legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>
Castro held one hand of the victim and the witness helped also by holding the
other hand of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bau­tista
then got the bamboo club from <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and struck the victim's head at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> put
his right hand on his head just as Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista hit him anew right where the victim placed his hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim became limp and he was dropped on
the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista drew a bolo which he carried by his side, held the victim by the head
and <span class="SpellE">bolowed</span> him several times slashing his neck and
hacking him on the head and face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
he gave the bolo to <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>
and ordered him to do likewise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>, out of fear,
hacked and slashed the victim on the face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro pulled
the deceased and deposited him by the roadside while Julian Aguilar took the
victim's bicycle farther down the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista ordered them to
go home, with assurance to pay them later their share of the P1,000.00 promised
to them by <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayo­yong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foul deed was all over before <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 o'clock</st1:time> that night.'<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in attaching full
complete and absolute credence to the testi­monies of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> the liberated accused turned witness for the
prosecution, against the herein defendant-appellant <span style="">Antonio </span>Bautista, notwithstanding that, aside from coming from a
polluted source, his tes­timonies were so apparently forced, unre­liable,
uncorroborated and contrary to the common sense and the ordinary course of
things.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred <span style="">in </span>attaching any more significance,

not <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>" those portions thereof against
the accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">III.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in <span style="">finding </span>and holding that there was

charged in the information.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in completely disre­garding
and in not giving any credit, weight or value to the testimony of the appellant
to the effect that, at the time of the incident, he was in Toledo, Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, in the house of his uncle <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Melegrito</span>, who corroborated his testimony simply on
the ground that, in the words of the trial court itself, "It is too good
and too perfect to be true," a conclusion which is not only biased, unjust,
unreasonable and apparently malicious, but also absolutely without any real
basis in fact, in evidence and in law.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">V.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in not declaring the
appellant absolutely innocent of the charge and, accordingly, <span style="">in </span>not ordering his complete and
absolute acquittal for the failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond
all reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro interposes the following </span><span style="">Assignment </span><span style="">of Errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in giving <span style="">any </span>weight to the testimony of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial Court erred in not acquitting <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro in the face of a reasonable doubt in the
guilt, if any, of herein appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the foregoing assignments of errors shows that a
common error is assigned, that is, that the trial Court erred in according
credence to the tes­timony of the accused-turned-State-witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Herein
appellants Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>, Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>
Castro join together in seeking to discredit and cast doubt on the testimony of
the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> discharged accused and in assailing
the latter's credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point,
it is important to mention the significant fact that in convicting herein
appellants and sentencing them to death, the trial Court relied heavily and
principally, if not solely, on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this automatic review,
therefore, it is imperative that <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span> testimony
be carefully studied and meticulously scruti­nized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of the arguments of herein appel­lants in support
of their common assigned error is that <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>
testimony comes from a polluted source and the same was not validly and
convincingly corroborated in any of its material points by any other witness or
witnesses, nor by any other evidence for the prosecu­tion, hence it cannot and
should not be legally accepted and made the basis for the imposition of the
supreme penalty of death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find the contention meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, before delving into the merits of appellants' arguments, a
brief discussion on the pertinent rules and applicable jurisprudence governing
the discharge of an accused to become a state witness is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In allowing the discharge of a defendant who is a <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">participes</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span><i>
</i></span>to become a witness for the pro­secution and against his co-defendants,
Rule 119 of the Revised Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Discharge of
one of several defendants to be witness for the prosecution.- When two or more
persons are charged with the commission of a certain offense, the competent
court, at any time before they have entered upon their defense, may direct one
or more of them to be discharged with the latter's con­sent that he or they may
be witnesses for the government when in the judgment of <span style="">the court:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is absolute necessity for the testimony
of the defendant whose dis­charge is requested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no other direct evidence available
for the proper prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of
said defendant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of said defendant can <span style="">be </span>substantially corroborated in its
material points;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant does not appear to be the most
guilty;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said defendant has not at any time been
convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A competent court within the above
section means the court before which the trial is held.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The discharge of an accused who may turn a state witness is expressly left to
the sound discretion of the trial court which has the exclusive responsibility <span style="">to see </span>that the condi­tions prescribed
by the rule exist.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
A discharge amounts to an acquittal and is a bar to future prose­cution for the
same offense, unless the released defend­ant fails or refuses to testify
against the other remaining accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and such failure is attributable to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> <span style="">will </span>or fault.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, it should be remembered that the testimony of a
discharged defendant, though admissible, is still subject to the tests on
credibility as any other testimonial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, although an order of discharge of an accused issued by the trial
Court may raise a presumption that all the requisites for its issuance in fact
exist, and therefore that the discharge is in order, the same Court is not duty
bound to believe the testimony of the discharged defendant and pronounce a
judgment of conviction against the remaining accused merely on the strength of
such testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court must be
satisfied that the State evidence consisting of the testimony of a liberated <span class="SpellE"><u>participes</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span>
is credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is also a well-settled rule that the testimony of
a self-confessed accomplice or co­-conspirator imputing the blame for the
killing and implicating his co-accused cannot by itself and without
corroboration, be considered as proof to a moral cer­tainty that the latter had
committed or participated in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it is required that the testimony be
substantially corroborated by other evidence in all its material points.</p>

<blockquote>"The true doctrine which should govern the testimony of
accomplices, or what may be variously termed principals, confederates, or
conspirators, is not in doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
evi­dence of accomplices is admissible and com­petent.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Yet such testimony comes from </u><u><span style="">a </span>'polluted source</u>.' <u>Consequently,
it is scrutinized with care</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It
is properly </u><u><span style="">subje</span>ct to
grave suspicion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If not
corroborated, credibility is affected</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even then, however, the defendant may be convicted upon the un­supported
evidence of an accomplice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
corroborated absolutely or even to such <span style="">an
extent as </span>is indicative of trustworthiness, the testimony of the
accomplice is sufficient to warrant a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"To quote from one of many decisions of this court, which
concerns both the credibi­lity of witnesses as determined by the trial court
and the competency of testimony by an accomplice, we turn to the case of The
United States vs. <span class="SpellE">Ambrosio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Falsario</span>
(1910, 17 Phil., 295), wherein it is said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'It is unquestionably true that <u>the testimony of an
accomplice must be taken with great care and caution.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It must </u><u><span style="">be </span>assayed and weighed with scrupulous care.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The corroborating testimony must be strong
and convincing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also true,
however, that when the testimony of an accomplice is corroborated by
unimpeachable testimony and by strong circumstances, it may be given its due
weight and force against the person in regard to whom it is presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'"<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Counsel for the appellants assigns as error the action of the

Government to make use of the persons thus discharged as witnesses; having ad­mitted
their guilt of the crime of which appellants were convicted, their evi­dence
should not have been taken into consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Guided by the principles laid down by the law and jurisprudence

<p class="BODY">There is no question as to the correctness of the premise of
appellants' contention that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>
comes from a polluted source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>fully
agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> was one of the original defendants in this murder
case, hence one of those whom the Municipal Judge who conducted the preliminary
investigation found reasonable ground to believe was guilty of the crime
charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This State wit­ness also unconditionally,
unmistakably and voluntarily admitted his participation in the conspiracy to
commit the murder and the actual killing of the deceased Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, both in the preliminary investigation, as evidenced
by his Extrajudicial Statement (Exhibit "C") and the record of the
proceedings of said investi­gation (Exhibit "F"), and during the
trial itself, when he was presented as the prosecution's star witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony is, therefore, regarded as the
testimony given by an accomplice or co-conspirator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alerted by this fact, the next inquiry is whether <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span> testimony withstands the test of
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the lower Court was not
absolute in giving credence to the whole testimony of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision under review states:</p>

witness testified that <span class="SpellE">altho</span> he used to see the
accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>
on several campaign meetings, he and the accused were never acquainted and have
never spoken together until one day in early January, 1966, while the witness
and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and
Julian Aguilar were walking on the roadside in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Inamotan</span>,

Bautista, allegedly accosted them, <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> saying to them:<span style="">&nbsp;

known before and whom he was meeting for the first time, right then and there

tes­tified that he and his companions have met with <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span>

afterwards, and in all these meetings <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> has proposed to them the liquidation of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> for reward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If

testimony on this point, no matter how stupid <span class="SpellE">Westri­mundo</span>

that he would himself personally propose to people he was meeting for the first
time the killing of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Matters of this kind are not done except in
secrecy and only after the proponent has the confidence of the per­sons to whom

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree </span><span style="">with </span>the trial court's holding that
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span> testimony to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> proposed
and was the master­mind in the killing of the victim Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> by offering a reward of <span style="">P1,000 </span>to all the accused is inherently improbable, and
accordingly, We find as justified the acquittal of the accused <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> based on the ground that, in the words of the
Court, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)<span class="SpellE">ndependent</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>
weak defense of alibi, the latter can not be convicted because the evidence
given against him was weak, unreliable and even unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No motive was given by the prosecution for <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Taba­yoyong</span> to wish
the killing of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was given why he should pay
P1,000.00 to have Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not on the weakness of an <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> alibi that he should be convicted but it should
be on the showing beyond reasonable doubt that he is guilty (upon which) a
conviction must be made." (CFI Decision, p. 47, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">The reasoning for <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong's</span>
acquittal however was ignored or brushed aside by the Court in convicting the
three <span style="">remaining
</span><span style="">accused Antonio Bautista, </span><span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while the trial court acquitted the
accused <span class="SpellE">Taba­yoyong</span> because it refused to give credence
to the evidence given by the discharge <span class="SpellE">defendent</span>
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> as <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong's</span>
alleged participation in the conspiracy to commit the murder, the said Court
nevertheless convicted the remaining three accused on the very same testimony
of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rationalizing its decision of conviction, the
Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"But <span class="SpellE">altho</span> the testimony of
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> on the conspiracy allegedly
broached to them by <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>
were to be detached from the facts in this case, this does not impair the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> against the other accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as this Court has already observed,
implicating <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>
appears more to be some one else's idea than <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, as also observed earlier in this
decision, the more probable time a conspiracy to kill Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was made was in the afternoon of January 21, 1966,
either in the house of <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>
or in the house of Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court recalls that on that day, Julian
Aguilar picked up Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> from his house
and together they went to the house of <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julian
Aguilar was with a guitar and thought they might do some serenading on that
night (Exhibit "D").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
there­fore clear that murder was not in their minds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>
in his pre­liminary investigation stated that in the house of Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista that evening, after they were wined
and fed, the agreement to kill Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was
'cooked'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that occasion all the
accused, <span class="SpellE">Westri­mundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>
excepted, were present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this
finding may perhaps affect the credibility of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>,
it still remains believable considering that this Court finds this charge
reconcilable with probability and the truth." (CFI Decision, pp. 48-49,
Records).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In convicting the accused <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>
Castro, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Evidence exists that this accused was the rival of the

make the accused want the deceased eliminated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Evidence also exists that this accused and Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
and Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista were seen
several times by the witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> in
gambling dens and were also connected with thefts in the neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wife of the deceased testified that her
deceased husband as barrio captain has been quite strict against gambling and
cattle rustling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has testified that <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
and Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista had in fact
been apprehended by the deceased and were released only after warning them
against a repeated violation of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To

tagged him as one of those who arrived in the house of <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>

Castro gave aid by holding the deceased Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>."
(CFI Decision, pp. 49-51, Records).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case </span><span style="">of the accused Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
his conviction by the trial court is reasoned </span><span style="">out in </span><span style="">the decision
under review as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'"In the case of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
after making a lame denial of his implication by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>,
he alleged that on the night Marcelo Guido was killed he and his family went to
sleep at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came to know of the death of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> only the following morning when he followed people
who went to see the body of the deceased which was lying by the roadside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that <span style="">his wife </span>and the <span style="">wife of the deceased are </span>second cousins that
he watched the embalming of the body of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
and attended the vigil of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beyond saying that he did not know the witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> and the accused <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cacayan</span> and Julian Aguilar before they were accused
together in this case, he did not have <span style="">ex</span>planation to offer why he was implicated in
so serious an offense which carries the penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Close at he claimed to be to the widow of
Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>, he never denied to her his alleged
participation in the killing of her <span style="">husband or asked her </span><span style="">why </span>he was ever accused of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance is quite unnatural because
if he was inno­cent the usual thing for him to have done was to remonstrate
with the deceased, deny­ing his alleged participation therein and asked why he
was ever implicated in the murder of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, he was likewise identified to
be with the group that ambushed and murdered Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Even </span>when
he was not in the court-room when the Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>
was conducting the preliminary investigation of this case, the witness
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> readily pointed to the one in the
court, admittedly planted therein by the judge to test the witness, who was
strikingly similar in appearance with the accused Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>,
as one of the murderers of Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This spontaneous identification of someone
who looked very much like Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> convinced
this Court that the accused was one of the plotters and was there on the road
when Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> like
his co-accused does not only belong to but is an assistant auditor of the party
against which the deceased campaigned and won as a barrio captain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Altho</span> he claimed he
was in good terms with the widow of the deceased and attended the vigil for the
latter, he has never talked with the said widow about the death of her husband
or told her of his vaunted innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
has not rebutted the testimony given against him by the widow of the deceased
that he, in company with his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span>
Castro and Antonio "<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>" Bautista, was on
several occasions apprehended by the deceased for gambling and warned against
repeated violations of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
the Court cannot find any explanation, unless it was true why Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> in his preliminary investigation and in the court
charged the accused Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> as a
co-conspirator and co-principal in murdering Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
a very serious offense which carries with it the penalty of death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Miguel <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>,
denied that he never knew Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>, he
practically affirmed the truth of the testimony of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> because it is inconceivable that the latter should
testify against the former if they did not know each other at all." (CFI
Decision, pp. 51-53, Records).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the accused Antonio Bautista, the Court after discrediting
his alibi, relied on "the fact that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>
unmistakably placed him in the scene of the killing," so his defense of
alibi becomes weaker still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, said
the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista,
like his co-accused, also sought the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that the day before Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was killed he went to Toledo, Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, to collect P50.00 which his uncle has borrowed from
him and he stayed until 4:00 o'clock in the morning of January 22, 1966,
alleging that when he was finally paid it was only in the night of January 21,
1966.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony was corroborated by
his alleged debtor who was his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Meligrito</span>, who testified that Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>'
Bautista went to his house on <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="1">January
 19, 1966</st1:date> to collect what he owed from him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became indebted to the accused at a time
when the accused was his visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
reason for the prolonged stay of the accused in his house, the witness said
that the accused arrived only when he was piling up his harvest and had to wait
until he was able to sell his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> on the 21st of
January and, having arrived late in his house, he was able to pay the said
accused only that night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This defense appears too good to be true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First the obligation was unusually
created.-The witness borrowing money from the accused when the latter was his
visitor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court knows that borrowing
does not usually happen that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused had to go and collect just before the crime was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to wait there for barely three days
without going anywhere, apparently to preclude the possibility of being placed
in the vicinity where the incident occurred.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even the payment has been timed to be in the night of the crime so that,
considering the dis­tance between Toledo, Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, it
could not be said of the accused that he was in <span class="SpellE">Manaoag</span>
when Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span> was killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This new-fangled defense is too perfect to be
true but it cannot fool anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
corro­borated only by his uncle who cannot even tell at once the name of the
alleged buyer of his <span class="SpellE">palay</span> who gave him the money
with which to pay the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the
Court says that this defense of alibi is weak and unreliable because it easily
fabricated and concocted without much opportunity of checking or rebutting it
and when we consider the fact that Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>
unmistakably placed him in the scene of the killing this defense of alibi
becomes weaker still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
appalled per­haps by the evidence against him even neg­lected to file his own
memorandum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> testified on the way to
the house of Antonio '<span class="SpellE">Bucot</span>' Bautista early in the
evening of January 21, 1966, all the accused, excluding <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span> stopped in the store of <span class="SpellE">Sito</span> <span class="SpellE">Escritor</span> in <span class="SpellE">Paitan</span> where Bautista bought four bottles of wine and where
they drank the first three bottles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
did not the accused even as much as cite - let alone present - <span class="SpellE">Sito</span> <span class="SpellE">Escritor</span> as their witness if
only to show that they were not together that night?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason was given for such fatal
omission." (CFI Decision, pp. 53-56, Records).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Summarizing the reasons of the trial court in convicting the
three accused, it can easily be discerned that the <span style="">conviction </span>was based on <span style="">(1)
</span>the identification of each of the accused by the discharged or liberated

of the accused and (3) the weakness of their respective alibis.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful analysis of the evidence on record, <span style="">We </span>find the
conclusions of the trial court to be without factual and legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The identification of the accused Bautista made by the defendant <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> whose testimony "unmistakably" placed him
(Bautista) at the scene of the killing," and the identification of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> who was "unfortunately
identified to be with the group that ambushed and murdered Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>," and that of the accused Castro who, according
to <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> "when Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>
was being murdered the accused <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro gave
aid by holding the deceased Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>" is
not worthy of credence and belief, not only because the evidence relied upon
comes from a polluted source but also because it is not supported by any other
material evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal
principles heretofore cited earlier in this decision as to the probative value
of evidence given by an accomplice, unsupported by corroborating evidence on
the material points are clearly applicable <span style="">to </span>the case <span style="">at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reject <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>
testimony incriminating the three (3) remaining accused not merely because it
is polluted, corrupt and contaminated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is highly improbable, unnatural and far </span>out <span style="">of the common experience </span>of man
whether in doing what is good and lawful or what is evil and wrong.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> has been accused
of stealing a cow and farming equipment worth Fifty Pesos (P50.00) in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pangasinan</span></span><span style="">, </span>which
case is still pending in court (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 4, 8, <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1967</st1:date>) and he has also

 27, 1967</st1:date>, cited in Brief for accused Castro, p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this evidence, <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>
character is open to grave suspicion and doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only evidence on record tending to prove herein appellants'
complicity in the crime charged, aside from <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span>
unbelievable and incompetent testimony, are the extrajudicial <span style="">confessions </span>of the missing original
co-accused, Julian Aguilar and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gacayan</span>, marked Exhibits "D" and "E",
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact,
before the actual trial could commence in the lower court, and while the
prosecuting fiscal was arguing his petition for the discharge of then accused
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> which was met with energetic
protests and objections from the respective counsel of the other accused, said
fiscal admitted:</p>

<blockquote>"I should be frank with the defense
that the evidence of the prosecution in this case are only the three con­fessions
of the three accused (refer­ring to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>,
Julian Aguilar and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gacayan</span>),
and we have no more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a need for

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Rule 130, Section 29 of the Rules of Court, the
declaration of an accused expressly acknowledging his guilt of the offense
charged may be given in evidence against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The corollary rule is that the confession of one of several co-accused
is not competent evidence against his co-accused, the reason being that the
confession of one of the defendants is hearsay evidence with respect to the
rest, as the latter had no opportunity to cross-examine the former<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
and since appellants' respective counsels <span style="">interposed
timely </span>and vigorous objections during the trial to the admission of<span style=""> </span>the aforementioned Exhibits
"D" and "E" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span class="SpellE">Ceralde</span>, August 2, 1967, pp. 103-105), the same being
hearsay are inadmissible as evidence against the <span style="">appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no other evidence to corroborate the
unreliable, unconvincing and unsatisfactory testimony of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span>
as far as herein appellants are concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>agree with the argument of the accused <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Antolin</span></span><span style=""> </span>Castro that it would be illogical and unfair for the trial
court to convict appellants on the basis of the testimony of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Garlejo</span> which was discredited by the court and so acquitted
the alleged mastermind of the killing, the accused <span class="SpellE">Westrimundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>, citing the case of People vs. Chaw Yaw
Shun, et al., 23 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 127 and reiterating the holding
in <span style="">People </span>vs. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, et al., L-13789, June 30, 1960, 108 Phil. 814, thus
–</p>

<blockquote>"Since the widow appears to be the star witness of the
prosecution whose testimony was given much weight in pinning liability on the
accused, the Supreme Court would not be consistent and true to logic and
fairness if it would now reach a verdict of conviction against them on the
strength of the same testimony which was discredited by the trial court insofar
as one of their co-accused in the same case is concerned." (Syllabus)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the possible motives pointed out in the judgment under
review, We rule that the evidence in support thereto are, to Our considered
view, very flimsy and weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For assuming
that the accused <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> Castro was the rival of the
deceased in the election of barrio captain and said accused lost to the
deceased for the position; that the next election for barrio captain was coming
up and this was a plausible cause for the accused Castro to eliminate the
deceased, it has not been shown that said accused was a candidate or interested
<span style="">in </span>running
for said position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming also that
the accused <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> "does not only belong to but
is an assistant auditor of the party against whom the deceased cam­paigned and
won as a barrio captain and that he was apprehended by the deceased on several
occasions for gambling with his co-accused Bautista and warned against repeated
violations of the law, there is also no showing that <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span>
and Bautista were charged in court or convicted for said offenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">But basically, the testimony of the widow as to these motives,
however plausible, is essentially hearsay, the probative value of which is open
to grave doubts and suspicion, especially in a capital accusation such as the
case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, while proof of motive is not necessary where there is a
positive identification of the accused, in the instant case where the
identification of the accused-appellants as the authors of the crime charged
proceeds from unreliable and unsatisfactory evidence, evidence of motive
becomes necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Salas, 66
<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 126; People vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Madera</st1:place></st1:city>,
57 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 349; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dorico</span>,
54 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 172).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the lack of motive to kill the offended party which has become
apparent from the rejection of <span class="SpellE">Garlejo's</span> testimony
that the killing was motivated in consideration of a price or reward allegedly
offered by the accused <span class="SpellE">Tabayoyong</span>, may be taken or
considered as a further basis for acquitting the remaining accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Padirayon</span>,
67 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 135).</p>

<p class="BODY">The remaining errors assigned by herein appellants which all
revolve around their respective defenses of alibi need not be lengthily
discussed for there can be no dispute of the well-known and oft-repeated
rulings of the Supreme Court on the inherent weakness of this particular
defense interposed by said appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However it must also be admitted that in quite a number of cases where
the evidence for the prosecution against the accused as author of a crime
charged is weak, doubtful, unconvincing, unreliable or unsatisfactory, the
defense of alibi assumes importance and acquires commensurate strength, and
therefore, may be given credence.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, We must "emphasize the fact that courts should not at once look
with disfavor at the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> When an accused puts up the defense of alibi, the court
should not at once have a mental prejudice against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, taken in the light of all the evidence
on record, it may be sufficient to acquit him x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>

We held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The alibis of the three
appellants, while weak in themselves, yet when coupled with the improbabilities
and uncertainties of the prosecution evidence and the absence of adequate proof
of conspiracy, suffice to raise reasonable doubts as to their
responsibility."</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Bautista's allegations that on the night of the murder
he was in Barrio Toledo, Ramos, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> in the house
of his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Melegrito</span>,
was sufficiently corroborated by the latter who testified in open Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, appellant <span class="SpellE">Begenio</span> simply
testified that on the fateful night of <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="1">January
 21, 1966</st1:date>, he was in his own house in the same barrio where the
murder was perpetrated, and that he was then sleeping with his wife and
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The simplicity of this <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> defense of alibi ought to be commended rather
than disbelieved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a defendant in a
murder case, he could have offered to establish a concocted alibi which would
bring him to a place far from the scene of the killing so as to make it
impossible for him to have participated in the commission of the crime, rather
than declare as the truth his pre­sence in the very same barrio where the
victim met his death in the hands of assassins.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are, there­fore, persuaded to take <span class="SpellE">Begenio's</span>
declarations regarding his whereabouts as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
to be true.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to appellant Castro, it is true that he has failed
to account for his whereabouts at the time of the murder for his evidence
consisted of proof tending to show where he was, what he was doing and whom he
was with on the day before the murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless despite this failure as well as the weakness of appellants'
evidence, their acquittal or conviction should be based on <u>all</u> the
evidence on record because "the accused cannot be convicted by reason of the
weakness of their alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution
must prove their guilt upon the strength of its evi­dence and not by the
weakness of that of the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
As We said in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Fraga</span>, et al</u>.,
speaking through Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes;</p>

<blockquote>"(A)n accused cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence
which, inde­pendent of his alibi, is weak, un­corroborated, and
inconclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule that alibi must
be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in
criminal cases; otherwise, we will see the absurdity of an accused being put in
a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak
than where it is strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In fine and essence, the prosecution has <span style="">failed </span>to prove the guilt of the accused-appellants beyond
peradventure of doubt, not because of the weakness of their alibi but due to
the reliance of the govern­ment <span style="">on </span>evidence
that is polluted and corrupt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
innocence of the three accused which is presumed by constitutional mandate has
not been successfully rebutted or overthrown, hence their acquittal must
necessarily result from and be ordered by virtue of this review.</p>
