<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>prosecution
evidence upon which <span style="">the trial court
based its finding of guilt </span>beyond <span style="">reasonable
</span>doubt is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The People's evidence reveals that at around 5:00 o'clock in
the morning of September 1, 1986, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>,
48 years old, married, storekeeper, residing at 11 <span class="SpellE">Simprosa</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City was in the process of backing out his j<span style="">eep </span>from the garage when he was startled
to find four strangers behind him armed with deadly weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of <span style="">the
men </span>stuck <span style="">a gun at </span><span style="">his </span>side and barked:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Patayin</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">makina</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having done as he was bade, Leonardo was
ordered to alight from the jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon
as he got off, the man who held the gun at him, accused Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span>, took the ignition key and the wallet from
Leonardo's back pocket containing P1,000.00 in cash intended for the day's
marketing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the garage, Leonardo was
hustled to the front door and once inside the house, the accused ordered the
former, '<span class="SpellE">dapa</span>, <span class="SpellE">dapa</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the men had hurriedly gone through the
premises, Leonardo was told to stand up and ordered to lead the way
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pasillo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>next to Alma's bedroom, Leonardo was
again ordered to lie flat on his belly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While in this position, he noticed the intruders going through the
family bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, he
heard his daughter Alma scream from her bedroom, "Jesus Christ, Jesus
Christ, Alleluia!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
followed by the sound of the footsteps of the malefactors rushing down the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo then ran towards the
terrace overlooking the driveway of the garage in time to see the accused <span style="">and his </span>cohorts on board the family <span style="">jeep </span>as it was leaving their
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He quickly gave chase but failed
to catch up with the jeep <span style="">as </span>it
sped towards the highway.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time that the accused were going through the bedrooms
of the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> family, Mrs. Corazon <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> was seated on the chamber pot when she was
approached by accused <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span> and at the point of
the gun ordered "<span class="SpellE">Dapa</span>, kung <span class="SpellE">hindi</span>
<span class="SpellE">mamamatay</span> <span class="SpellE">kayong</span> <span class="SpellE">lahat</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
led to the passageway where she joined her husband flat on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the accused had gone, she lost no time
in going to her daughter Alma's room because she was much<span style=""> </span>concerned for the 20-year old girl who
was <span style="">still </span>single.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The two younger children, <span class="SpellE">Annalyn</span> and Leo had managed to hide inside the terrace soon
as the commotion started.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The couple's
son, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, was likewise taken <span style="">by </span>the accused and ordered to lie down
on the floor next to his parents together with their maid.) To her great
sorrow, she found Alma bathed in her own blood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Alma was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead on
arrival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"C".) Police investigators recovered a fan knife from the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> residence which appears to be the death
weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C".)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span> was positively
identified by the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> couple during the
confrontation at <span style="">the </span>police
station and in open Court as one of the armed men who forcibly entered their
house on the day in question who caused the death of their daughter Alma after
robbing Leonardo of P1,000.00 in cash." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 23-25)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense on the other hand, is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"In </span>denying the
charge against him, accused <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span> raises the
defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared on the
witness stand that he is <span style="">an </span>electrician,
residing at No. 41, <span class="SpellE">Sauyo</span> Road,<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Bagbag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, formerly
employed at ADR Enterprises, located at No. 411 Republic Supermarket, Sta.
Cruz, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left Manila for <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City on August 25, 1986 to buy scrap electrical
materials that could be repaired for resale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stayed in the house of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bentanilla</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City for around ten (10) days when he
returned to Manila on September 5, 1986.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The police arrested him at his house between 12:00 midnight and 1:00
o'clock in the morning of September <span style="">23, </span>1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the investigation, he
claimed to have been subjected to physical torture by the police." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. <span style="">25)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant raises the following assignment of errors, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL <span style="">COURT ERRED </span>IN FINDING APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND <span style="">REASONABLE </span>DOUBT OF ROBBERY WITH
HOMICIDE ON THE BASIS OF THE TESTIMONIES OF WITNESSES WHICH WERE CONFLICTING,

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT FAILED TO APPRECIATE OR
IGNORED UNASSAILED EVIDENCE ESTABLISHING APPELLANT'S INNOCENCE OF ANY
PARTICIPATION WHATSOEVER IN THE OFFENSE HE WAS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING."
(Appellant's Brief, p. 7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it is noted that the Office of Solicitor General<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>,
in lieu of<span style=""> </span>an <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief, filed a manifestation recommending the acquittal of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that the trial court overlooked
certain facts and circumstances pertaining to the identification of the
appellant by the prosecution witnesses as one of the perpetrators of the crime
which could alter the result of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records, this Court agrees with the
Solicitor General and finds merit in the arguments and submissions of the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support the judgment of conviction, the trial court relied
upon the identification of the appellant made by the prosecution
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a question, however,
with regards to the "positive" identification of the appellant which
casts doubt on the judgment of conviction beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that the way he was presented alone, not in
a police line-up, for identification to the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
spouses, Leonardo and Corazon and their two sons, Eduardo and Leo is
inadmissible citing <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Hassan</span></u></span><span style="">, <u>157</u> <u>SCRA</u> <u>261</u>, <u>272</u>
[<u>1988</u>] that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The police procedure adopted in this case in which only the
accused was presented to witness <span style="">xxx, </span>is
as tainted as <span style="">an <span class="SpellE">uncounselled</span>
</span>confession and thus <span style="">falls </span>within
the same ambit of the constitutionally entrenched protection."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no law requiring a police line-up <span style="">as </span>essential to a proper identification
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, G. R. <span style="">No. 80406, November 20, 1990).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, even if </span>there was no police line-up, there <span style="">could still be proper identification </span>as
<span style="">long </span><span style="">as </span>such identification <span style="">was
</span>not suggested to the witnesses by the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there are circumstances which indicate that
the identification could have been suggested to <span style="">the witnesses by the police.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">First, although the <span style="">affidavit
</span>of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> dated September 23, 1986 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A", <span style="">Records,
p. 179) </span><span style="">shows </span>that the
appellant was recognized by Leonardo from among the people in the investigation
room, <span style="">in his </span>testimony he stated
that <span style="">one </span>of the policemen asked
him if he knew that person (the appellant) (TSN, February 13,<span style=""> 1987, </span>p. 17), directing Leonardo's
attention to the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, the affidavit of Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
dated September <span style="">23, 1986 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G", </span>Records, p. <span style="">186) </span>shows that the <span style="">appellant was presented alone </span>to <span style="">Eduardo but </span><span style="">in </span>his <span style="">testimony he </span>counteracted
this by stating that <span style="">he picked out the
appellant from among several persons in civilian attire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 6, 1987, p. 13) However, </span><span style="">he later </span>testified that:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
accused <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span> was presented <span style="">to </span>you, were there other people who
where presented <span style="">to </span>you aside
from <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span> <span style="">to
identify?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS</blockquote>

<blockquote>He was with other
people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. FORTUN</blockquote>

<blockquote>And those persons were
police officers, were they not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
they were in civilian clothes?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>And</u>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">And in</span> fact you know they were police
officers <u>because</u> <u>all</u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>And</u>
<u>only</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Salguero</u></span> <u>who</u> <u>was</u> <u>the</u>
<u>only</u> <u>civilian</u> <u>there</u> <u>who</u> <u>was</u> <u>there</u> <u>without</u>
<u>a</u> <u>gun</u> <u>you</u> <u>presume</u> <u>he</u> <u>was</u> <u>a</u> <u>suspect</u>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(TSN, March 6, 1987, pp.
17-18; Emphasis supplied)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant then, could at once be picked <span style="">out </span>from among <span style="">the police officers as it was obvious that the other people were police
officers in spite of their civilian attire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Third, the affidavit of Leo <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
dated September 23, 1986 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H, Records, p. 185)
shows that the appellant was singled out from a police line-up with <span style="">Pat. Santos, <span class="SpellE">Gurat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dacillo</span> in civilian clothes but in <span class="SpellE">Sevilla's</span> testimony, he stated that when he saw the
appellant, the appellant was alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, March 27, 1987, p. 16)</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is a glaring inconsistency in the manner by which the appellant
was identified by the witnesses in <span style="">the
police station.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The letter-referral <span style="">to </span>the
prosecutor's office (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K, Records, p. 305) states
that the appellant was singled out from a police line-up but it can be gleaned
from the witnesses' testimonies that the police may have influenced the
identification by the <span class="SpellE">Sevillas</span> <span style="">of the appellant as they either pointed out
the appellant, presented the appellant in an alleged line-up, or presented the
appellant alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This kind of
identification is pointedly suggestive as the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>
family, having been earlier informed by the police that they have arrested
somebody (TSN, February 6, 1987, p. 16; TSN, February 13, 1987, p. 17) were
already on the look-out for that arrested person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although nothing in Corazon <span class="SpellE">Sevilla's</span>
testimony implies that she was influenced by the police, rather she even stated
that she recognized the appellant and even went up to him to box him (TSN,
February 20, 1987, p. 19), such statement should be regarded with skepticism in
view of the above-mentioned circumstances and considering the previous
statements made by Corazon (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. E and F; Records,
pp. 183-184).</p>

<p class="BODY">In her September 1, 1986 affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
E) Corazon described the appellant as "<span class="SpellE">mga</span> 35 <span class="SpellE">taong</span> <span class="SpellE">gulang</span> xxx, <span class="SpellE">mga</span> 5'6", <span class="SpellE">maitim</span>, <span class="SpellE">katam-taman</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">katawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">unat</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">buhok</span>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her September 23, 1986 affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F) on
the other hand, contained:</p>

<blockquote>"T.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ano</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span>

<blockquote>S.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mukha</span>, <span class="SpellE">begote</span>, <span class="SpellE">boses</span>, <span class="SpellE">laki</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">tiyan</span>, at <span class="SpellE">lahat</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">hong</span> <span class="SpellE">katauhan</span>
<span class="SpellE">niya</span>." (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F,
Records, p. 184)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was only after seeing the appellant that Corazon remembered
the "<span class="SpellE">begote</span>" and the "<span class="SpellE">laki</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">tiyan</span>",
both important distinguishing marks in describing a person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Corazon maintains that she made it a point to
remember the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> face (TSN, February 20, 1987,
p. 21) but she forgot to mention the moustache in describing the appellant
(TSN, February 20, 1987, p. 28) in her September 1, 1986 affidavit, the very
day the incident happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, when Corazon was questioned on whether she suspected
anyone, she mentioned a certain Alan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E) as her
suspect but when confronted in open court, she denied having stated such a
thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is aware that
affidavits, taken ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> are almost always
incomplete and often inaccurate (People v. <span class="SpellE">Segwaben</span>,
G.R. No. 88401, February 19, 1991) but in this case, Corazon was asked three
times in open court whether said affidavit is accurate and complete and three
times she said yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, February 20,
1987, p. 22, 24, 26).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She even admitted
that she saw the particular portion which states the name of Alan during her
examination of the affidavit in open court but did not take exception to it as
she was not asked to explain it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,
February 20, 1987, p. 26)</p>

<p class="BODY">The factors presented above throw doubt upon the <span style="">positive </span>identification of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the Solicitor<span style="">-</span>General cites a <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span>
of other facts, namely:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the real suspect of the police was <span class="SpellE">Otchok</span> Salvador (not appellant), a notorious criminal
wanted by the police for robbery and other crimes (May 19, 1987 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 14-16 – Ramon <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Jarapa</span></span><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Otchok</span> Salvador planned and </span>executed the robbery at
the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> residence (May 29, 1987 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 6-7 – <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> de <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the jeep of the <span class="SpellE">Sevillas</span>

– Ramon <span class="SpellE">Jarapa</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant (unlike <span class="SpellE">Otchok</span>
Salvador) carried no criminal record, was a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanod</span> for several years, was an 'asset' to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Police in the resolution of organized crime in
his locality, and did not flee, hide (despite the closeness of his residence to
that of the <span class="SpellE">Sevillas</span>) or resist arrest when
apprehended like a common criminal by the police (May 29, 1987 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> – Ramon <span class="SpellE">Jarapa</span>; August 18,
1987 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 5-7 – Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span>)."
<span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>p.
80)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor-General also cites certain unanswered
questions which give rise to doubts:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did it take three (3) weeks for the police
to go after appellant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why was it necessary to give him the
third-degree treatment and investigate him without the presence of a lawyer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What exactly did the police tell the members
of the <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> family upon fetching them to identify
the suspect apprehended?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did they tell
them that appellant already admitted participation in the ghastly crime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why is there no police report or follow-up

cohorts?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Most probably, with respect to the third nagging question, the
police bragged that they had apprehended <u>one</u> <u>subject</u> <u>who</u> <u>admitted</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>crime</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The effect of such information to a family crying out for justice
would be emotional and unpredictable, swift and instantaneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would be no careful reflection." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 77-78)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>somewhat
surprising that the decision of the trial court did not carry any lengthy
discussion on the questioned identification of the appellant (Decision, p. 9)
despite <span style="">its </span>being raised in the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> memorandum (Memorandum, pp. 13-18, Records, pp<span style="">. </span>345-350) Instead, it examined what it
termed as "significant flaws in the <span style="">theory
of the defense." (Decision, p. 4) These flaws, aside from the
"positive" identification of the appellant, are what the trial court
relied upon to sustain the conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court enumerated the inconsistencies between the
testimony of the appellant and that of his own witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These inconsistencies delve on minor details
like whether the appellant was receiving a fixed <span style="">salary or not and on what the appellant purchased during</span><span style=""> his </span><span style="">trip to <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decision, pp. 5-7) It also dismissed the
testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Venancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>
and Corporal Ramon <span class="SpellE">Jarapa</span> who both claimed that the
main suspect of the crime was a certain <span class="SpellE">Otchok</span>
Salvador.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 29, 1987, p. 7 and
pp. 14-16) <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> stated that he decided to make </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">clean
breast of it because he pitied the accused who was detained for a crime he did
not commit (TSN, May 29, 1987, p. 9) but the trial court set aside his
testimony on grounds that he had no motive to show </span>special <span style="">concern </span>for <span style="">the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decision, p. 8)
As for <span class="SpellE">Jarapa's</span> testimony, it was disregarded as
hearsay, based principally on his own personal opinions and conclusions from
the information given him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decision, p.
8)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court pointed out the weaknesses in the evidence of the
defense. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But we held in <u>People</u> <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Hizon</u></span>, 180 SCRA 364, 371 [1989] that:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx Even if <span style="">it </span>be argued that the defense is weak, the fact is that the
prosecution <span style="">is </span>even weaker and
so must fail by its own impotence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rule </span>is firmly
entrenched that a judgment of conviction must be predicated on the strength of
the evidence for the prosecution and not on the weakness of the evidence for
the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Furugganan</span>, G.R. Nos. 90191-96, January 28, 1991, People v.
de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span>, 187 SCRA 228, 247, [1990]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the role of the prosecution to prove
the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt in order to overcome the
constitutional <span style="">presumption of
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the
identification of the accused is of utmost importance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With the abovementioned principle and without the
"positive" identification of the appellant, the evidence presented by
the prosecution is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence
guaranteed by the Bill of Rights to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We held <span style="">in </span><u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Ng</u>, 142 SCRA 615, 622 [1986] that:</p>

<blockquote>"From the earliest years of this Court, <span style="">it </span>has emphasized the rule that
reasonable doubt in criminal cases must be resolved in favor of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirement of proof beyond
reasonable doubt calls for moral certainty of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been defined as meaning such proof ‘to
the satisfaction of the court, keeping in mind the presumption of innocence, as
precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that which it is given to
support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="">not </span>sufficient for the proof to establish a probability, even
though strong, that the <span style="">fact </span>charged
is more likely to be true than the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must establish the truth of the fact to a reasonable and moral
certainty - a certainty that convinces and satisfies the reason and the
conscience of those who are to act upon it.’ (Moreno, Philippine Law
Dictionary, 1972 Edition, p. 379, citing U.S. v. Reyes, 3 Phil. 3)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the test of moral certainty was not
fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since such is the case, the
trial court likewise erred in its non-appreciation of the defense of alibi of
the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While alibi is admittedly
a weak defense, this Court, however, does not at once look upon it with
disfavor nor does it have a mental prejudice against the accused who uses it as
his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the defense of alibi
does not relieve the prosecution of the required burden of proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the rule that alibi must be
satisfactorily proven ever intended to change the burden of proof in criminal
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, alibi need not be
inquired into where the prosecution's evidence is weak as in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Mendoza, 174 SCRA 432,
452 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered, we find the evidence for the prosecution
inadequate to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
