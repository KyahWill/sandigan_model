				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Eleuterio Adonis appeals from the judgment of the trial court finding him guilty of murder.<br><br>He was charged with murder in an information which reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 10th day of June 1985 in the municipality of Dulag, Leyte, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the honorable court, the abovenamed accused, with deliberate intent to kill, with treacherous and evident premeditation, did then and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attacked, assaulted, stabbed, and hacked Benedicto Basas with a bladed weapon known as 'pisao' which the accused had provided himself, thereby hitting and inflicting on the latter a fatal wound that caused the instant death of Benedicto Basas.<br><br>Contrary to law." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>At arraignment, Adonis pleaded not guilty. After trial, the court found him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and sentenced him to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay P30,000.00 to the heirs of the victim Benedicto Basas.<br><br>The judgment was based on factual findings outlined by the trial court as follows. At about 7:00 pm on 10 June 1985, after Benedicto Basas had finished his dinner in his home, he went down to their front yard together with his wife and son. Benedicto sat on a bench with his back against the street. His wife and 14-year old son also sat down, one somewhat to the right and the other somewhat to the left of Benedicto, but both facing Benedicto. The accused Eleuterio Adonis, also known as "Tandang," suddenly appeared behind Benedicto Basas and stabbed the latter once with a knife known as "<i>pisao</i>", killing him. Benedicto stood up and then fell down. Thereafter, Eleuterio ran away from the shocked wife and son of his victim.<br><br>For his part, the accused Eleuterio invoked self­-defense <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and controverted the version of the prosecution witnesses. Eleuterio testified that while he and Bienvenido Arguta were passing by the house of Benedicto Basas, the latter suddenly hacked at him with a bolo but that he was not hit. Eleuterio retaliated by stabbing Benedicto with a knife, inflicting a single though mortal wound on the deceased. Eleuterio claimed that Benedicto had stood in front of his house, intoxicated and challenging passersby to a fight moments before his death.<br><br>In his appeal, Eleuterio assigned the following as supposed errors of the trial court:<br><br><ol><li>The trial court erred in choosing the version of the prosecution over the version of the defense on the basis of speculation, conjecture, and suspicion;<br><br></li><li>the trial court erred in not acquitting the accused-appellant on the ground of reasonable doubt. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></li></ol>After careful examination of the evidence on record, we find that appellant Eleuterio did not succeed in substantiating the above claimed errors.<br><br>The well-entrenched doctrine in this jurisdiction is that when the accused invokes self-defense, he has the burden of proving the elements of that defense by clear and convincing evidence. To do so, he must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution's. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> For implicit in self-defense claimed by appellant Adonis is the admission that he had in fact killed Benedicto Basas; hence, even if the evidence for the prosecution were weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused had owned the killing.<br><br>Appellant failed to discharge his burden. The evidence presented to show unlawful aggression on the part of the victim is contradictory and thus clearly inadequate.<br><br>Defense witnesses asserted that the deceased Basas was armed when he was killed, but their testimonies were at best inconsistent with each other. Appellant Eleuterio Adonis <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and Uldarico Gobangco <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> testified that Basas was armed with a bolo when he was challenging passers by to a fight moments before his death. On cross-examination, however, Gobangco backed off from this claim:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"Atty. Martines (cross-examination): </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="90%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">On that particular incident, was he drunk?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Uldarico Gobangco:</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">He was drunk.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q.</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">Was he armed with a bolo?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A.</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY"><span style="font-style: italic;">He had none I was not able to see.</span>" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote><br>This inconsistency does not merely deal with a minor detail. That Basas was armed on that occasion is crucial in establishing the fundamental requisite of self-defense: that Basas had exercised unlawful aggression against appellant. Adonis himself, of course, claimed that a bolo was used by Benedicto Basas in attacking him; his claim was, effectively, bereft of corroboration.<br><br>There are other contradictions in the testimonies submitted for the defense which, while not as critical, nonetheless cloud the credibility of the defense witnesses.<br><br>Appellant Adonis testified that he went to his farm with his cousin Bienvenido Arguta at around 5:00 p.m. on June 10, 1985. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This conflicted with Arguta's assertion that he met accused at about 7:00 pm of June 10, 1985. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Appellant also stated that the road by the house of Basas where the crime took place was the only route to appellant's ricefield. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> This is contrary to Arguta's statement that there were actually other routes to Eleuterio's ricefield. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Defense witness Gobangco testified that deceased Basas had announced "I will kill you!" when he attacked appellant. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> But Arguta testified that the (alleged) attack of Basas on appellant was not preceded by any exchange of words. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The defense also presented evidence to prove the bad moral character and quarrelsome disposition of the deceased. Barangay Captain Uldarico Gobangco testified that "whenever the victim got drunk, he would challenge anybody to a fight and that he was also [known] to steal a carabao.” <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The Barangay Captain also stated that, per the notebook where he customarily recorded all incidents occurring in their barangay, a complaint for theft had been lodged against the deceased Basas. The trial court, however, noted that the statement of the Barangay Captain Gobangco that the deceased had habitually challenged other people to a fight whenever he was drunk found no support in his own notebook.<br><br>The testimony of the Barangay Captain was given neither credence nor weight by the trial court. While the accused may prove the bad moral character of the victim, the proof must be of his general reputation in the community and not merely of isolated and specific acts. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Thus, the mere allegation that a complaint for theft had been filed against the victim cannot establish his general reputation. Besides, there was no showing that Basas was ever convicted of that charge, assuming it had ever been filed.<br><br>Moreover, as the trial court held, no evidentiary value can be attributed to the Barangay Captain's notebook. That notebook can hardly be considered an official record, for record-keeping is vested in the Barangay Secretary and not in the Barangay Captain. Moreover, an incomplete record, especially one with blank or torn pages allowing the inclusion or deletion of certain matters, lacks reliability; its contents are open to the suspicion that they are reflective not of all actual events, but only of those which the recorder, for reasons of his own, wanted to record.<br><br>Even if it had been proved by competent evidence that the deceased was of a quarrelsome disposition, such evidence would only have established a <i>probability</i> that he had indeed started an unlawful assault on Eleuterio. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> This probability cannot overcome the positive statement of the prosecution witnesses during trial that the accused-appellant had assaulted Basas without any provocation. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>It is well to recall that whether or not appellant acted in self defense is essentially a question of fact. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The trial court judge, having seen and heard the witnesses during the trial, is necessarily in a better position than an appellate court to evaluate and weigh their testimonies. In the absence of any showing that the trial court failed to appreciate facts and circumstances that would have altered its conclusion, its factual findings must be accorded respect. We find no adequate reason to disturb the conclusion of the trial court that the appellant had not acted in legitimate self-defense.<br><br>Upon the other hand, the evidence presented by the prosecution did show beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of appellant. Rosalina Basas, wife of deceased Benedicto Basas, and their son Jovencio, positively identified accused-appellant Eleuterio Adonis as the person who had, without provocation, stabbed Basas to death. Jovencio Basas testified thus:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"Atty.

The attack delivered by appellant Eleuterio was sudden, without warning of any kind. One thrust of the "<span style="font-style: italic;">pisao</span>" on the unprotected back of Benedicto Basas, then unarmed and peacefully digesting his evening meal, was all that was necessary. Eleuterio promptly ran away, before the wife and son of the victim could recover from the shock of seeing Benedicto suddenly stand up and then crumple to the ground. The speed and dispatch with which the deed was done argues clearly that the mode of attack had been devised and sought rather than improvised at the spur of the moment.<br><br>We conclude that the trial court erred only in awarding an indemnity to the heirs of the victim in the amount of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00).
