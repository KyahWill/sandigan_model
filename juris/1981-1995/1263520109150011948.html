of a reinstated employee should be limited to three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jaime <span class="SpellE">Sambajon</span> worked for Associated
Anglo?American Tobacco Corporation as driver-agent at P300 a month for
the period from October, 1968 to September 1973. On <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="10">October 1<span class="GramE">,1973</span></st1:date>, he was
promoted to promo­tional dealer at P740 a month. Due to an alleged shortage in
his accounts in the sum of P2<span class="GramE">,536.25</span>, the firm on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1974</st1:date> filed with the
Department of Labor an application to dismiss him. <span class="GramE">(p. 19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sambajon</span> on <st1:date month="3" day="11" year="1974">March 11, 1974</st1:date> filed a complaint against the firm for
reinstatement, <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and overtime pay. <span class="GramE">The Labor Arbiter of Regional Branch No.</span> V at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in a decision dated <st1:date month="10" day="30" year="1975">October 30, 1975</st1:date>
ordered the firm to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Sambajon</span> with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from <st1:date month="3" day="1" year="1974">March
 1, 1974</st1:date> at the rate of P740 a month (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).
The National Labor Relations Commission in its resolution of <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1976">March 22, 1976</st1:date> dismissed the firm's appeal from
that decision because it was not under oath as required by section 3, Rule IX
of the NLRC rules (p. 24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The firm appealed to the Secretary of Labor. Acting Secretary <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> in his order of <st1:date month="12" day="13" year="1976">December 13, 1976</st1:date> directed the
dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Sambajon</span> because of the shortage in his
account (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sambajon</span> appealed to the Office of the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which in a decision dated <st1:date month="12" day="22" year="1982">December
 22, 1982</st1:date> held Acting Secretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong's</span>
order to be a nullity and affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision (p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Labor Arbiter issued a writ of execution for <u>P106<span class="GramE">,064.20</span> as <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
thirteenth-month pay and living allowances as of </u><st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="3"><u>March 31, 1983</u></st1:date>, as computed by its socio-economic
analyst (p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). To stay execution, the firm
posted a <span class="SpellE">super­sedeas</span> bond in the sum of <u>P162<span class="GramE">,000</span></u> (p. 65, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The firm in its petition four <i>certiorari</i> does not assail
the reinstatement. It simply prayed that the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
be limited to three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, following the settled rule on the matter and the
recommendation of the Solicitor General, that in the interest of pragmatic and
expeditious justice <u>the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should be
limited to three years only</u> (Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Employees
Association vs. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd., L-25291, March 10, 1977, 76

Industrial Relations, L-31276, September 9, 1982, 116 SCRA 417).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision under review is modified. In
