<blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding the accused ROLANDO DAYOT y GARCIA @ JUNIOR

<p class="BODY">As we noted at the outset, the foregoing judgment faces a
reversal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that where the accused enters a plea of guilty to
the capital offense, the trial court is called upon to observe the following
procedure:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plea of guilty to
capital offense; reception of evidence. -- When the accused pleads guilty to a
capital offense, the court shall conduct a searching inquiry into the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and full comprehension of the consequences of
his plea and require the prosecution to prove his guilt and the precise degree
of culpability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused may also
present evidence in his behalf.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As we held, the judge is required to accomplish three
things:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to conduct a searching
inquiry into the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> and full comprehension
of the consequences of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> plea; (2) to
require the prosecution to prove the guilt of the accused and the precise
degree of his culpability; and (3) to inquire whether or not the accused wishes
to present evidence on his behalf and allow him to do so if he so desires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This procedure is mandatory,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and a judge who fails to observe it commits a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The exchange between the judge and the accused-appellant does not
persuade us that the accused-appellant, in subsequently pleading guilty, fully
understood the legal consequences of his plea.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find this from his own impressions, obviously mistaken, that by
admitting authorship of the offense, he would stay in prison for "[p]<span class="SpellE">erhaps</span> less than ten years,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
although "it could also be more,"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
or in other words, he would "get off lightly", relatively, than had
he<span style=""> </span>insisted <span style="">on </span>his innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it would turn out, tragically, Judge <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> sentenced him in fact to life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not think that the accused-appellant
anticipated, or knew, the exact punishment--and the serious results--that
awaited him <span style="">as a </span>consequence of
his change of heart.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also do not think that Judge <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
had been up to the task in appraising the accused-appellant of what lay ahead
should he, the accused-appellant, admit guilt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While he did intimate to the accused that he, the accused, might be put
away for more than ten years, <span style="">His </span>Honor
<span style="">was </span>less than candid in failing
to inform him that he, by admitting guilt, in fact, faced a life in prison, and
that "more than ten years" meant <span style="">a </span>whole lot more indeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">A "searching inquiry," under the Rules, means more than
informing cursorily the accused that he faces <span style="">a jail term </span>(because the accused is aware of that) but so also,
the exact length of imprisonment under the law and the certainty that he will
serve time at the national penitentiary or a penal colony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not infrequently indeed, an accused pleads
guilty in the hope, as we said, of a lenient treatment, or upon a bad advice or
promises of the authorities or parties of a lighter penalty should he admit
guilt or express "remorse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is the duty of the judge to see that he does not labor under these mistaken
impressions, because a plea of guilty carries with it not only the admission of
authorship of the crime proper but also of the aggravating circumstances
attendi<span style="">ng</span> it, that increase
punishment.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A "searching inquiry" likewise compels the judge to
content himself reasonably that the accused has not been coerced or placed
under a state of duress--and that his guilty plea has not therefore been given
improvidentl<span style="">y</span>--either by actual
threats of physical harm from malevolent quarters or simply because of his, the
judge's, intimidating robes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
judge should have so satisfied himself in the case at bar, considering especially
the tender years of the accused (who was about twenty at the time of the trial)
and his vulnerability to ill-advised suggestions from outside influences.</p>

<p class="BODY">Above all, the trial judge must satisfy himself that the accused,
in pleading guilty, is truly, guilty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is possible say, by requiring him to narrate the tragedy or say, by
making him reenact it, or by causing <span style="">him </span>to furnish missing details.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there can be no hard and fast <span style="">rule </span><span style="">as </span>to how <span style="">a </span>judge may conduct a "searching
inquiry," as to the number and character of questions he may put to the
accused, or as to the earnestness with which he may conduct it, since each case
must be measured according to its individual merit, taking into consideration
the age, educational attainment, and social status of the accused confessing
guilt, among other things, the singular barometer is that the judge must in all
cases, fully convince himself that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the accused, in pleading guilty, is doing so voluntarily, and (2) he, in so
doing, is truly guilty, and that there exists a rational basis for a finding of
guilt, based on his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court leaves to judges, considering their training, ample discretion, but
expects them at the same time, that they will be true to their calling and be
worthy ministers of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judges therefore must be cautioned, toward this end, against the
demands of sheer speed in disposing of cases, for their mission after all, and
as has been time and again put, is to see that justice is done.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five questions posed <span style="">by
</span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> to the accused-appellant,
needless to say, hardly amount to a "searching inquiry".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should have known better, because he
actually condemned a twenty-year old to spend a great deal of his mortal life
in prison.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have said, the procedure laid down by the Rules is
mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge having satisfied
himself that the accused fully understood the significance, effects, and
consequences of his guilty plea, the next step would be to make the prosecution
adduce evidence to determine the guilt and exact culpability of the accused
taking into account the presence of other possible aggravating or mitigating
circumstances--and thereafter, to make the accused present his own evidence, if
he is so minded, for the same purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The counsel for the defense, in his brief, berates the judge for
failing to appreciate minority in favor of the accused-appellant, and so does
the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is
disappointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is more to the case
than faulty application of penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
we earlier stated, <span style="">a </span>mistrial,
as it were, had been committed, and if the counsel for both the defense and
government had truly done their homework, regardless of their apparent haste
"to get the job done," the more far-reaching implications of the case
should have dawned on them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As for the
counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span> for the accused, Atty. Fernando
Fernandez, the Court leaves these harsh words for him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather than protect the rights of the
accused-appellant, he succeeded in collaborating in the "setting up"
of his own client.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let him, accordingly,
be reminded that as counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, his solemn
duty is nonetheless to make sure that his client gets what he lawfully
deserves--whether an acquittal or if a conviction, the rightful penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court sees it, his concern merely was
to "get it over with," at the expense, unfortunately, of the very
freedom of the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like
Judge <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, it was his obligation to apprise
fully the appellant as to what faced him, should he accept guilt, and that
there was no turning back should he admit guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like His Honor, he deserves our serious
rebuke.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note with mounting concern, at this juncture, the increasing
lack of dedication lawyers of the Public Attorney's Office [PAO, formerly,
Citizens Legal Aid Office (CLAO)] have handled their cases, especially of
destitute clients, judged from their performance in cases not only before the
Supreme Court but likewise before inferior courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find this distressing, having in mind the
nation's efforts to bring justice closer to the needy, and the oath, which all
lawyers have sworn to uphold, to conduct themselves with all good fidelity to
their clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that counsel de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, like PAO lawyers, are not remunerated (although
they are entitled to reimbursement for transportation expenses) is no excuse
that will justify abdication of duty and infidelity to client's cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As members of the bar, all lawyers, paid or
hired for <b style=""><span style="">pro</span></b><span style=""> <b style="">bono</b> </span>purposes, are called upon
to pursue their cases with identical passion and with utmost concern for the
fullest protection of their client's rights and interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PAO, as the people's counsel precisely,
is no less subject to this abiding obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let the PAO be admonished that this Court will not tolerate, henceforth,
indifference and sloth in its ranks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A
</span>trial is meant to be <span style="">a </span>safeguard against putting an innocent man to prison, and at
the same time a guaranty that the guilty obtains his just dues, thus:</p>

trial court, or the Supreme Court on review, as to the possibility that there

nature of the charge to which he pleaded guilty, and to ascertain the
circumstances attendant to the commission of the crime which justify or require
the exercise of a greater or lesser degree of severity in the imposition of the
prescribed penalties.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
