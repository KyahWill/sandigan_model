Pythagoras Oliver who had been appointed by the court as counsel <u>de oficio</u> back in 3 November 1986<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> for appellants Alberto Raguindin and Crispin Sarmiento, failed to file an appellants' brief and apparently changed his address without informing this Court with the result that copies of resolutions addressed to him had been returned "unserved".&nbsp; Accordingly, the Court appointed Atty. Candido del Rosario as counsel <u>de oficio</u>, who filed an appellants' brief in due time for appellants Raguindin and Sarmiento.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, for his part, filed another appellee's brief.<br><br>Appellant Severino Catubig assigned the following errors in his appellant's brief:<br><blockquote>"1. that the trial court below erred in convicting accused-appellant Severino Catubig on the basis of the weak evidence of the prosecution; and<br><br>2. that the trial court below erred in denying said appellants' motion for reconsider­ation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>Appellants Alberto Raguindin and Crispin Sarmiento, for their part, assigned the following errors in their appeal brief:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">"1. </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">the lower court erred in convicting appellants based mainly on extrajudicial confessions obtained without assistance of counsel in gross violation of the Constitu­tion; without said confessions, glaringly, there is insufficient evidence to sustain conviction;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2. </td> <td><div align="justify">the lower court erred when in convicting appellants, it relied more on the weakness of defense of 'alibi' rather than on the strength of the evidence of the prosecution, contrary to the well-settled doctrine that a litigant must rely more on the strength of his evidence and not on the weakness of the evidence of his adversary as held in <u>People v.

Court of Appeals</u> (131 SCRA 319)."</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The Court will consider the above assignments of errors together, the main thrust of all the appellants' arguments being that the prosecution had failed to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, considering that their extra-judicial confessions were inadmissible having been executed without the assistance of counsel.<br><br>The relevant facts according to the prosecution were as follows:<br><br>On 2 February 1981, around 1:30 o'clock in the morning, appellants Catubig, Raguindin and Sarmiento (all residents of the squatters’ area at Padre Martinez St., Scout Tobias, Roces Avenue, Quezon City) and a fourth man known only as "Felipe", posted themselves along Scout Tobias.&nbsp; A taxicab came along and parked at the corner of Scout Tobias and Roces Avenue and two (2) persons alighted therefrom.&nbsp; These two (2) persons, owners of the taxicab, the brothers Atty. Renato Flores and Engineer Ernesto Flores, were residents of Roxas District, Quezon City.&nbsp; Appellants' group approached the parked taxicab and announced to the Flores brothers that they were being held up.&nbsp; Ernesto and Renato Flores refused to hand over their cash and other valuables to appellants.&nbsp; Appellants and "Felipe" thereupon assaulted the Flores brothers seeking to grab their cash and other valuables.&nbsp; The two (2) brothers first put up a fight and then tried to run away; but they were overtaken by the group.&nbsp; Ernesto Flores was stabbed a number of times in the chest, forehead and other parts of his body; he dropped to the ground fatally wounded.&nbsp; The group then turned their full attention upon Renato Flores.&nbsp; Sarmiento Catubig ran to his house in the nearby squatters' area and secured a knife and promptly returned to the scene and inflicted multiple stab wounds on Renato on different parts of his body.<br><br>Conrado Perez, a <u>barangay tanod</u>, residing in the same squatters' area was awakened by shouts -- "<u>Magnanakaw! Magnanakaw!</u>".&nbsp; Perez rushed out of his residence to find out what was going on.&nbsp; He met his neighbor Reynaldo Balbarosa who advised him (Perez) to call the Barangay Captain Joaquin Torres as there was "big trouble" ("<u>malaking gulo</u>") at the corner of Scout Tobias and Roces Avenue.&nbsp; Perez went towards the scene of the hue and cry; he stopped at the corner of Scout Tobias and Padre Martinez St. and from there he saw at the intersection of Roces Avenue and Scout Tobias four (4) men beating up two (2) men, later identified as the brothers Renato and Ernesto Flores.&nbsp; Perez saw Renato, then wearing a white T-shirt, stabbed and fall to the ground.&nbsp; With the Flores brothers sprawled dead on the ground, the four (4) malefactors divested both victims of their respective watches, gold rings and money.<br><br>Moments later, the four (4) malefactors fled from the scene.&nbsp; Catubig fled to his house in Padre Martinez St. while appellants Sarmiento and Raguindin forthwith proceeded to Bulacan and there took shelter in a house of Sarmiento's cousin.&nbsp; The fourth man, "Felipe", similarly quickly departed from the scene of the crime.<br><br>Meantime, Conrado Perez reported the incident to <u>Barangay</u> Captain Torres who in turn promptly called in the Quezon City police authorities.&nbsp; The dead bodies of Ernesto and Renato Flores were brought by the police to the National Bureau of Investigation ("NBI"), Medico Legal Division, for autopsy.&nbsp; NBI Medico Legal Officer Ricardo G. Ibarola, Jr. rendered a <u>post mortem</u> report finding that the victims had sustained multiple stab wounds in different parts of the bodies and that both died of severe hemorrhage, secondary to stab wounds in the chest in the case of Ernesto Flores, and in the neck and chest in the case of Renato Flores.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Appellant Severino Catubig was apprehended by the police at about 3:00 o'clock the same night, in his house in the squatters' area where he pretended to have been asleep all throughout the hue and cry.&nbsp; Perez had pointed out.&nbsp; Catubig's house to the police.&nbsp; Appellants Sarmiento and Raguindin were arrested the next day in Bulacan.&nbsp; The fourth man "Felipe", however, was never captured by the police.<br><br>At the police station, all three (3) accused were identified by Conrado Perez and Reynaldo Balbarosa as among the group of four (4) persons who had killed and robbed Ernesto and Renato Flores.&nbsp; The three (3) appellants were separately and individually investigated.&nbsp; According to the prosecution, each one was informed in Pilipino of the accusation made against him, his constitutional rights to keep silent and to counsel and of the consequences in the event they waive their rights.&nbsp; Each of them voluntarily offered to give their respective extrajudicial statements or confessions.&nbsp; Their extrajudicial statements were subscribed to by them before a fiscal of Quezon City.<br><br>We do not think it necessary to determine whether the taking of the extrajudicial statements of the three (3) accused and the taking account by the trial court of such statements, resulted in the violation of the constitutional rights of the accused-appellants.&nbsp; We have examined the decision and "Supplemental Decision" of the trial court as well as the record and it is clear to us that the evidence of record, quite apart from the extrajudicial statements of the appellants, was quite sufficient to support the conclusion of the trial court that the appellants had been proved guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>Conrado Perez, the <u>barangay tanod</u>, was the principal prosecution witness and he established from his testimony that: <blockquote><ol type="a"> <li>the appellants and a fourth man, aside from the two (2) victims, the Flores brothers, were the only persons around at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission;<br><br></li><li>appellants and the fourth man had assaulted and beaten up the victims;<br><br></li><li>one of the victims fell to the ground wounded while appellants were in the process of assaulting him; and<br><br></li><li>the appellants and the fourth man all hastily left the crime scene, with one of them (appellant Catubig) carrying a bloodied knife.</li></ol></blockquote>Perez testified in the following manner:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2">"ATTY.

Accordingly, we cannot take Balbarosa's statement into account.<br><br>It is well-settled that the testimony of a single eye-witness, if found convincing and trustworthy by the trial court, is sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; In the instant case, the trial court found the testimony of Conrado Perez, who gave his account of the incident and accompanied the police within half an hour of the occurrence of the incident, to be credible and firm.&nbsp; The principle is firmly settled that the findings of the trial court as to the credibility of witnesses are entitled to the highest respect of the appellate court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> There was no evidence of any ulterior or evil motive on the part of Conrado Perez that might have led him to testify falsely against the appellants.&nbsp; Conrado Perez knew the appellants quite well, since they were all neighbors in Padre Martinez St., Scout Tobias, Roces Avenue, Quezon City.&nbsp; In addition, Conrado Perez and Severino Catubig were <u>compadres</u>.<br><br>That there was conspiracy in the instant case is quite clear from the record.&nbsp; The appellants were all present at the scene of the crime.&nbsp; They acted in concert in attacking the two (2) victims, assaulting and beating them up and chasing them and stabbing them and in divesting them of their watches, gold rings and money.&nbsp; After the bloody slayings were done, they fled from the scene and went their separate ways.&nbsp; By their concerted actions, the appellants showed that they acted in unison and cooperated with each other, towards the accomplishment of a common felonious purpose which was to rob and kill the victims.&nbsp; We conclude that the trial court was justified in finding the presence of conspiracy.&nbsp; Where conspiracy is shown, the governing principle is that the act of one is the act of all and it is not essential that each of the appellants actually stabbed each of the two (2) deceased victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The appellants’ principal, if not sole, defense was that of alibi.&nbsp; Appellant Sarmiento claimed that he was in Bulacan attending a baptismal party at the time the robbery with homicide occurred.&nbsp; For his part, appellant Raguindin claimed that he too was in Bulacan at the time of the incident.&nbsp; Appellant Catubig asserted that he was peacefully sleeping in his house in the squatters' area in Padre Martinez St., Scout Tobias, Quezon City, when the police arrived to arrest him that same night or rather, early morning.<br><br>The trial court was not persuaded by the appellants' claims.&nbsp; Ranging their claims of alibi against the clear and positive identification made by prosecution witness Conrado Perez of the appellants as among the malefactors, the appellants’ defense of alibi is unavailing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Alibi is generally a weak defense since it is so easy to fabricate.&nbsp; For this reason, courts must view such defense with caution and should accept the same only when proved by positive, clear and satisfactory evidence.&nbsp; Thus, the general principle is that it is not enough to prove that the person accused of a crime was somewhere else when the crime was committed; it must also be demonstrated that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time of the commission thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Appellants were all residents of the squatters’ area close by the scene of the crime at Scout Tobias and Roces Avenue.&nbsp; There was no physical impossibility of their presence at the scene of the crime considering the close proximity of the squatters' area, where they all resided, to the crime scene.&nbsp; The Court simply did not believe appellants Raguindin and Sarmiento's contention that they were in Bulacan at the critical time, nor Catubig's claim that he had slept through all the noise and commotion on Scout Tobias.&nbsp; We find no reason to overturn these holdings of the trial court.<br><br>We conclude that appellants are guilty of the crime of robbery with homicide defined and penalized under Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code which reads as follows:<br><blockquote>"Art. 294.&nbsp; <u>Robbery with Violence Against or Intimidation of Persons-Penalties</u>.&nbsp; -- Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence or intimidation of any person shall suffer:<br><br><ol><li>the penalty of from <u>reclusion perpetua</u> to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed;<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x x x"</li></ol></blockquote>In the instant case, one information was filed charging the appellants with the killing of the two (2) Flores brothers.&nbsp; While two (2) persons were slain on the occasion of the robbery in the instant case, the Solicitor General urges that only one crime of robbery with homicide was committed, and submits that the circumstance that not one but two (2) persons were killed on the occasion of the robbery should be appreciated as an aggravating circumstance, invoking the authority of <u>People v. Mabilangan</u><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and <u>People v. Español</u>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> We find that neither <u>Mabilangan</u> nor <u>Español</u> discussed at any length the precise statutory or other legal basis for finding presence of an aggravating circumstance where multiple and not just a single homicide occurred on the occasion of the robbery.<br><br>In the instant case, we believe that we should refrain from declaring the fact that two (2) victims, and not just one (1), were killed on the occasion of the robbery constitutes an aggravating circumstance, considering that such aggravating circumstance, even if it were found, would be academic in view of the non-enforceability of the death penalty under the 1987 Constitution.&nbsp; Re-examination of <u>Mabilangan</u> and <u>Español</u> must await a more propitious occasion.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the trial court sentencing each of the appellants Severino Catubig, Alberto Raguindin and Crispin Sarmiento to <u>reclusion perpetua</u>, is hereby <b>AFFIRMED</b>, except that the appellants shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the heirs of the victims in the amount of P50,000.00<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (not P12,000.00) for each victim, in addition to the P50,000.00 for each victim as moral damages, P4,000.00 as actual damages, i.e., burial expenses and P10,500.00 (not P4,000.00) as the aggregate value of the personal property taken from the two (2) dead brothers.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Fernan, C.J., (Chairman), Gutierrez, Jr., Bidin</i>, and <i>Davide, Jr., JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Up to this time, the identity of John Doe is unknown and he remains at large.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Rollo, p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Id., p, 113.&nbsp; In his decision dated 28 November 1984, Trial Judge Oscar L. Leviste after finding the accused Catubig, Raguindin and Sarmiento guilty of robbery with homicide and sentencing them to life imprisonment, ordered them to pay, jointly and severally the heirs of the victims the amount of P12,000.00 as actual damages and P50,000.00 as moral damages for each victim.&nbsp; In a "Supplemental Decision" dated the same day, Judge Leviste added the requirement that the appellants compensate the heirs of the two (2) deceased victims in the amount of P4,000.00 representing the value of the items of personal property taken by the accused from the two (2) deceased.&nbsp; Rendition of this "Supplemental Decision" appears to the Court to be a most unusual and quite unnecessary procedure which, at the same time, reflects adversely upon the level of care and diligence exercised by the trial judge in the performance of his official duties.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Id., p. 90.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Id., p. 106.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Record, Exhibit "C", p. 8 and Exhibit "D", p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> TSN, 14 May 1981, pp. 3, 5, 7, 8-11.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Appellee's Brief, p. 16; underscoring supplied.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Tejones v.
