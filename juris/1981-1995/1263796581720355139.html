bold">is </span>a petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the National Labor
Relations Commission's (NLRC) decision which modified the Labor Arbiter's
decision and ordered the Manila Mandarin Employees Union to pay the wages and
fringe benefits of Melba C. <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> from the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">she </span>was placed on forced leave until
she is <span class="SpellE">atually</span> reinstated, plus ten percent (10%)
thereof as attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Manila
Mandarin Hotel was ordered to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> and
to pay her whatever service charges may be due her during that period, which
amount would be held in escrow by the hotel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was filed on <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="1">January
 19, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondent filed her comment on <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1987</st1:date> while the Solicitor General filed a comment on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1987</st1:date> followed by the
petitioner's reply on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We </span>treat
the comment as answer and decide the case on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are undisputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein private respondent, Melba C. <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>,
an employee of Manila Mandarin Hotel since 1976 and at the time of her
dismissal, assistant head waitress at the hotel's coffee shop, was expelled
from the petitioner Manila Mandarin Employees Union for acts allegedly inimical
to the interests of the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The union
demanded the dismissal from employment of <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> on
the basis of the union security clause of their collective bargaining agreement
and the Hotel acceded by placing <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> on forced
leave effective <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union security clause of the collective bargaining agreement
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 2.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Dismissals.</span></blockquote>

employment by the Company after complying with the requisite due process
requirement; xxx" (Underlining supplied)" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 114)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Two days before the effective date of her forced leave or on <st1:date year="1984" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>
filed a complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal against
herein petitioner-union and Manila Mandarin Hotel, Inc. before the NLRC,
Arbitration Branch.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-union filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that the
complainant had no cause of action against it and the NLRC had no jurisdiction
over the subject matter of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">This motion was denied by the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the hearings that ensued and the submission of the parties’
respective position papers, the Labor Arbiter held that the union was guilty of
unfair labor practice when it demanded the separation of <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The union was then ordered to pay all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>wages and fringe <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">benefits </span>due to <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">from </span>the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">she was </span>on forced leave until actual
reinstatement, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span>pay P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as exemplary damages and P10,000.00 as attorney's
fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge against the hotel was
dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <st1:place>Union</st1:place> then appealed to the respondent
NLRC which modified the Labor Arbiter's decision as earlier stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">A subsequent motion for reconsideration and a second motion for
reconsideration were denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner raises the following <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">assignment </span>of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">I</p>

<blockquote>"THAT RESPONDENT NLRC ERRED IN NOT
DECLARING THAT THE PRESENT CONTROVERSY INVOLVED INTRA-UNION CONFLICTS AND
THEREFOR IT HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER THE SUBJECT-MATTER THEREOF.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">II</p>

<blockquote>"THAT RESPONDENT
NLRC SERIOUSLY ERRED IN HOLDING PETITIONER LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRIVATE
RESPONDENT'S SALARY AND FRINGE BENEFITS, AND AWARD OF 10% ATTORNEY'S FEES,
AFTER FINDING AS UNMERITORIOUS HER PRETENDED CLAIMS OR COMPLAINTS FOR UNFAIR
LABOR PRACTICE, ILLEGAL DISMISSAL, AND DAMAGES."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 6-9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of the NLRC jurisdiction over the case, the Court
finds no grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC conclusion that the dispute is not
purely intra-union but involves an interpretation of the collective bargaining
agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(CBA) p</span>rovisions and
whether or not there was an illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the CBA, membership in the union may be lost through expulsion
only if there is non-payment of dues or a member <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">organizes, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">joins, </span>or
forms another labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">organization.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span>charge
of disloyalty against <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> arose from her
emotional remark to a waitress who happened to be a union steward, "<span class="SpellE">Wala</span> <span class="SpellE">akong</span> <span class="SpellE">tiwala</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> Union <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remark was made in the course of a heated
discussion regarding <span class="SpellE">Beloncio's</span> efforts to make a
lazy and recalcitrant waiter adopt a better attitude towards his work.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General when he noted that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">"</span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> The Labor Arbiter explained correctly that '(I)f the
only question is the legality of the expulsion of <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>
from the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> undoubtedly, the question is one
cognizable by the BLR (Bureau of Labor Relations).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, the question extended to the dismissal
of <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> or steps leading thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, when the hotel decides the
recommended dismissal, its acts would be subject to scrutiny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Particularly, it will be asked whether it
violates or not the existing CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
violations of the CBA would be unfair labor practice.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Article 250 of the Labor Code provides the following:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner also
questions the factual findings of the public respondent on the reasons for <span class="SpellE">Beloncio's</span> dismissal and, especially, on the argument that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was on forced leave; she was never dismissed;
and not having worked, she deserved no pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds nothing in the records that indicates reversible
error, much less grave abuse of discretion, in the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
findings of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled principle that findings of facts
quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC, which have acquired expertise because
their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters, are generally accorded not
only respect but at times even finality if such findings are supported by
substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Akay</span> Printing Press v. Minister of Labor and Employment,
140 SCRA 381; Alba Patio de <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> v. Alba Patio de <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Employees Association, 128 SCRA 253; <span class="SpellE">Dangan</span> v. National Labor Relations Commission, 127 SCRA
706; De La <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> v. Mindanao Portland Cement
Corporation, 127 SCRA 647).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner now questions the decision of the National Labor
Relations Commission ordering the reinstatement of the private respondent and
directing the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> to pay the wages and fringe benefits
which she failed to receive as a result of her forced leave and to pay
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no error in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">questioned decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Hotel would not have compelled <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>
to go on forced leave were it not for the union's insistence and demand to the
extent that because of the failure of the hotel to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span>
as requested, the union filed a notice of strike with the Ministry of Labor and
Employment on August 17, 1984 on the issue of unfair labor practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hotel was then compelled to put <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> on forced leave and to stop payment of her salary
from <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as provided for in the collective bargaining
agreement between the petitioner - the Union and the Manila Mandarin Hotel,
"the Union shall hold the Company free and blameless from any and all
liabilities that may arise" should the employee question the dismissal, as
has happened in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is natural for a union to desire that all workers in a
particular company should be its dues-paying members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since it would be difficult <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to insure 100 percent membership on a purely
voluntary basis and practically impossible that such total membership would
continuously be maintained purely on the merits of belonging to the union, the
labor movement has evolved the system whereby the employer is asked, on the
strength of collective action, to enter into what are now familiarly known as
"union security" </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">agreements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The collective bargaining agreement in this case contains a union
security clause - a closed-shop agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">A closed-shop agreement is an agreement whereby an employer binds
himself to hire only members of the contracting union who must continue to
remain members in good standing to keep their jobs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is "the most prized achievement of
unionism".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It adds membership and
compulsory dues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By holding out to loyal
members a promise of employment in the closed-shop, it welds group
solidarity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(National
Labor Union v. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo's</span> <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>,
Inc., 97 Phil. 184).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a very
effective form of union security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held that a closed-shop is a valid form of union
security, and such a provision in a collective bargaining agreement is not a
restriction of the right of freedom of association guaranteed by the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Lirag</span> Textile Mills, Inc. v. Blanco, 109 SCRA 87; <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:33.0pt">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Artex</span> Development Company, Inc., 21 SCRA 561).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court stresses, however, that union security clauses are also
governed by law and by principles of justice, fair play, and legality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Union security clauses cannot be used by union
officials against an employer, much less their own members, except with a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:33.0pt"> </span>high sense of responsibility,
fairness, prudence, and judiciousness.</p>

<p class="BODY">A union member may not be expelled from her union, and
consequently from her job, for personal or impetuous reasons or for causes
foreign to the closed-shop agreement and in a manner characterized by
arbitrariness and whimsicality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This is particularly true
in this case where Ms. <span class="SpellE">Beloncio</span> was trying her </span>best
to make a hotel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bus boy do his work
promptly and courteously </span>so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as
to serve hotel customers in the coffee shop expeditiously and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">cheerfully.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Union
membership does not entitle waiters, janitors, and other workers to be sloppy
in their work, inattentive to customers, and disrespectful to supervisors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">Union</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
should have disciplined its erring and troublesome members instead of causing
so much hardship to a member who was only doing her work for the best interests
of the employer, all its employees, and the general public whom they serve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision of the National Labor
