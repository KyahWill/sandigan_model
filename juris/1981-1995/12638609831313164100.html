				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> Bus Line ("<span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span>") seeks the reversal or modification of the
Court of Appeals’ decision in C.A.-G.R. CV No. 12476 and the absolution of
petitioner from all liability arising from the collision between one of
petitioner's buses and a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> owned by respondent
Coronado, driven by respondent <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span> and in which <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> respondent <span class="SpellE">Shinyo</span> was a
passenger.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by the trial court and adopted by
the Court of Appeals, are summarized in the trial court's decision and quoted
in the Court of Appeals’ own judgment in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"The accident happened on the <st1:street><st1:address>National
  Highway</st1:address></st1:street> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30
 A.M.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="8">August 2, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven
by Lope <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span> was then coming from <span class="SpellE">Pila</span>, Laguna on its way towards the direction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of Sta. Cruz, traversing the old
highway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it reached the intersection
where there is a traffic </span>s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ign
'yield', it stopped and cautiously treated the intersection as a 'Thru Stop'
street, which it is not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The KBL bus was
on its way from Sta. Cruz, Laguna, driven by its regular driver <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>, on its way
towards </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
regular itinerary of the KBL bus is through the </span>town proper of <span class="SpellE">Pila</span>, Laguna, but at times it avoids this if a bus is
already fully loaded with passengers and can no longer accommodate additional
passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the KBL bus neared the
intersection, <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
inquired from his conductor if they could still accommodate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">passengers and learning that they were
already full, he decided to bypass <span class="SpellE">Pila</span> and instead, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">proceed along the national highway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
admitted that there was another motor vehicle ahead of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The general rule is that
the vehicle on the national highway has the right-of-way as against a feeder
road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another general rule is that the </span>vehicle
coming from the right has the right-of-way over the vehicle coming from the
left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The general rules on right-of-way
may be invoked only if both vehicles approach the intersection at almost the
same time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, both roads
are national roads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, the KBL bus
was still far from the intersection when the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
reached the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As testified to by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span>
who was driving a Mustang car coming from the direction of Sta. Cruz and
proceeding towards the direction of Manila, he stopped at the intersection to
give way to the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Behind <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span> were
two vehicles, a car of his client and another car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Laguna Transit bus had just entered the
town of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pila</span></st1:place></st1:city>
ahead of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The sketch marked Exhibit
'E' indicates very clearly that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had
already traversed the intersection when it met the KBL bus head-on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also obvious that the point of impact
was on the right lane of the highway which is the lane properly belonging to
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As testified </span>to by Lope <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span>, the
KBL bus ignored the stopped vehicles of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span>
and the other vehicles behind Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span> and
overtook both vehicles at the intersection, therefore, causing the accident.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Judging from the testimony
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span>
and the sketch (Exhibit 'E'), the sequence of events shows that the first
vehicle to arrive at the intersection was the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing that the road was clear, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which had stopped at the intersection began to move
forward, and for his part, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span> stopped his
car at the intersection to give way to the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about this time, the KBL bus was
approaching the intersection and its driver was engaged in determining from his
conductor if they would still pass through the town proper of <span class="SpellE">Pila</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon learning
that they were already full, he turned his attention to the road and found the
stopped vehicles at the intersection with the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
trying to cross the intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
KBL bus had no more room within which to stop without slamming into the rear of
the vehicle behind the car of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Manicad</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The KBL driver chose to gamble on proceeding
on its way, unfortunately, the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span>, which had the right-of-way, was about to cross the
center of the highway and was directly on the path of the KBL bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The gamble made by <span class="SpellE">Llamoso</span>
did not pay off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The impact indicates
that the KBL bus was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> at a fast rate of
speed because, after the collision, it did not stop; it <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>
for another 50 meters and stopped only when it hit an electric post (pp. 3-4,
Decision; pp</span>. 166-167, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Record)."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This decision of the Court of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> assails the findings of fact
of the Regional Trial Court and of the Court of Appeals, and insists before
this Court that respondent <span class="SpellE">Grajera</span>, driver of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, was at fault and not the driver of <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran's</span> bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
must be remembered that it is not the function of this Court to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>analyze and weigh evidence presented
by the parties all over again and that our jurisdiction is in principle limited
to reviewing errors of law that might have been committed by the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span>
has made no compelling showing of any misapprehension of facts on the part of
the Court of Appeals that would require us to review and overturn the factual
findings of that court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
examination of the record shows that not only are the conclusions of fact of
the Court of Appeals and the trial court on who -- the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">bus </span>driver or the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver --
had acted negligently and was at fault in the collision of their vehicles,
amply supported by the evidence of record, but also that <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran's</span>
bus driver was grossly negligent and had acted wantonly and in obvious
disregard of the applicable rules on safety on the highway.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kapalaran's</span> driver had become aware
that some vehicles ahead of the bus and <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> in
the same direction had already stopped at the intersection obviously to give
way either to pedestrians <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>to
another vehicle about to enter the intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bus driver, who was driving at a speed
too high to be safe and proper at or near an intersection on the highway, and
in any case too high to be able to slow down and stop behind the cars which had
preceded it and which had stopped at the intersection, chose to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">swerve </span>to the left lane and overtake
such preceding vehicles, entered the inter­section and directly smashed into
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> within the intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately before the collision, the bus
driver was actually violating the following traffic rules and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">regulations, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thus,
a </span>legal presumption arose that the bus driver was negligent,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
a presumption <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> was unable to overthrow.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
should have stopped before entering the "Y-intersection" because of
the possibility that another vehicle behind <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>cars which had stopped might not similarly stop and might
swerve to the left to proceed to the highway <u>en</u> <u>route</u> to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
is more ingenious than substantial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
also offers illustration of the familiar litigation tactic of shifting blame
from one's own shoulders to those of the other party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driver, seeing the cars closest to the intersection on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">o</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pp</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">osite </span>side of the highway come to a
stop to give way to him, had the right to assume that other vehicles further
away and behind the stopped cars would similarly come to a stop and not seek
illegally to overtake the stopped vehicles and come careening into the
intersection at an unsafe speed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner's bus was still relatively far away from the intersection when the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> entered the same; the bus collided head-on into the
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> because the bus had been going at an
excessively high velocity immediately before and at the time of overtaking the
stopped cars, and so caught the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> within the
intersection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also the
responsibility of the bus driver to see to it, when it overtook the two (2)
cars ahead which had stopped at the intersection, that the left lane of the
road within the intersection and beyond was clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The point of impact was on the left side of
the intersection (the right lane <span class="GramE">so</span> far as concerns
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> coming from the opposite side), which was
precisely the lane or side on which the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had a
right to be.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> also assails the
award of moral damages against itself, upon the ground that its own bus driver,
third-party defendant, was apparently not held liable by the trial court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> argues that there was no
justification for holding it, the employer, liable for damages, considering
that such liability was premised upon the bus driver's negligence, and that petitioner
"as mere employer" was not guilty of such negligence or imprudence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This contention is thoroughly unpersuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The patent and gross negligence on the part of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran's</span> driver raised the legal presumption that <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> as employer was guilty of negligence either in
the selection or in the supervision of its bus drivers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the employer is held liable for damages, it has of course a right of
recourse <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a</span>gainst its own
negligent employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> was interested in maintaining its right of
recourse against or reimbursement from its own driver,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
it should have appealed from that portion of the trial court's decision which
had failed to hold the bus driver responsible for any damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran's</span>
pretense, its liability for the acts and negligence of its bus driver is not
"merely subsidiary", and is not limited to cases where the employee
"cannot pay his liability", nor are private respondents compelled
first to proceed against the bus driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The liability of the employer under Article 2180 of the Civil Code is
direct and immediate:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>it is not
conditioned upon prior recourse against the negligent employee and a prior
showing of the insolvency of such employee.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
So far as the record shows, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> was
unable to rebut the presumption of negligence on its own part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The award of moral damages against petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> is not only entirely in order:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>it is also quite modest considering <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Shinyo's</span> death during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this petition, a death hastened by,
if not directly due to, the grievous injuries sustained by him in the violent
collision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals deleted the award of exemplary damages which
the trial court had granted in order "to serve as a deterrent to others
who, like the plaintiff [<span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span>], may be minded to
induce accident victims to perjure themselves in a sworn statement." The
Court of Appeals held that there was no basis for this award of exemplary
damages, stating that it was not "such a reprehensible act to try to
gather witnesses for one's cause" and that there was no evidence of use of
"pressure or influence" to induce the accident victims to perjure
themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While that might have been
so, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals overlooked another and far
more compelling basis for the award of exemplary damages against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Kapalaran</span> in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question that petitioner's bus driver was grossly and very
probably criminally negligent in his reckless disregard of the rights of other
vehicles and their passengers and of pedestrians as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is entitled to take judicial notice
of the gross negligence and the appalling disregard of the physical safety and
property of others so commonly exhibited today by the drivers of passenger
buses and similar vehicles on our highways.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The law requires petitioner as common carrier to exercise extraordinary
diligence in carrying and transporting their passengers safely <u>"as far
as human care and foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of very
cautious persons</u>, with due regard for all the circumstances."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In requiring the highest possible degree of diligence from common carriers and
creating a presumption of negligence against them, the law compels them to curb
the recklessness of their drivers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
While the immediate beneficiaries of the standard of extraordinary diligence
are, of course, the passengers and owners of cargo carried by a common carrier,
they are not the only persons that the law seeks to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For if common carriers
carefully observed the statutory standard of extraordinary diligence in respect
of their own passengers, they cannot help but simultaneously benefit
pedestrians and the owners and passengers of other vehicles who are equally
entitled to the safe and </span>convenient use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of our roads and highways.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">law </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">seeks to stop and
prevent the slaughter and maiming of people (whether passengers or not) and the
destruction of property (whether freight or not) on our highways by buses, the
very size and power of which seem often to inflame the minds of their
drivers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 2231 of the Civil Code
explicitly authorizes the imposition of exemplary damages in cases of quasi-<span class="SpellE">delicts</span> "if the defendant acted with gross
negligence".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus we believe that
the award of exemplary damages by the trial court was quite proper, although
granted for the wrong reason, and should not only be restored but augmented in
the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is aware
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Shinyo</span> did </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">file a separate </span>petition for review to
set aside that portion of the Court of Appeals’ decision which deleted the
grant by the trial court of exemplary damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is settled, however, that issues which must be resolved if
substantial justice is to be rendered to the parties, may and should be
considered and de<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cided by this Court
even if those issues had not been explicitly raised by the party affected.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

demands of substantial justice but also the compelling considerations of public
policy noted above, which impel us to the conclusion that the trial court's
award of exemplary damages was erroneously deleted and must be restored and
brought more nearly to the level which public policy and substantial justice
require.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In much the same vein, we
believe that the award by the trial court of P15,000.00 as attorney's fees and
litigation </span>expenses, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deleted by
the Court of Appeals, should similarly be restored, being both authorized by
