Injunction, petitioner <span style="">seeks </span>the
nullification of the Order of respondent Court of Industrial Relations dated
April 16, 1969, upholding its jurisdiction, and of its Resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
dated July 1, 1969 denying the Motion for Reconsideration, both issued in Case
No. 1814-MC, entitled "In the Matter of Certification Election in
Philippine Rubber Project Co., Inc., <span class="SpellE">Kabasalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, Philippines Association of Free Labor Union
(PAFLU), Petitioner,"</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Philippine Rubber Project Co., Inc. is a duly
organized corporation with principal offices at <span class="SpellE">Kabasalan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It owns a
rubber plantation consisting of 1019 <span class="GramE">has.,</span> more or
less, and is engaged in the planting and growing of rubber trees from which
rubber latex is tapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also has a
processing plant in its plantation where latex is processed into rubber in its
crude form.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is engaged in the
processing not only of its own latex product but also of others like the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Rubber Company and the Mindanao Rubber Company
and small rubber planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its workers
are interchangeably employed in the sense that during certain periods, known as
the withering season, employees in the processing plant also work in the
plantation to avoid being laid off because of absence of work in the processing
plant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents Associated Labor Union <span style="">(ALU), </span>Mindanao Federation Labor (MFL), and Philippine
Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) are labor organizations duly
registered with the Department of Labor, now Ministry of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="10">October <span style="">17, </span>1966</st1:date>,
respondent PAFLU instituted before respondent Court of Industrial Relations the
aforementioned Petition for the certification of the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
as the exclusive bargaining representative of the rank and file workers of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>, numbering about 300.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Motion to Dismiss filed by respondent MFL, the jurisdiction
of respondent CIR was placed in issue on the ground that petitioner company
covered by the Petition for certification is an agricultural enterprise.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1967</st1:date>,
respondent ALU filed a Motion for Intervention contending that it had actual,
real and material interest in the case as majority of the employees are its
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ALU then prayed either that the
petition be dismissed or that it be certified as the sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of the rank and file workers of <span class="GramE">petitioner
company</span> should respondent Court decide that it had jurisdiction, and
that a certification election be held to determine the representative of the
rank and file workers for purposes of collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court thus ordered a Hearing Examiner, to proceed to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to conduct the hearing and investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1968</st1:date>,
respondent Court ordered both parties to submit their respective memoranda on
the issue of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On even date,
respondents PAFLU and ALU also agreed to a consent election in the event that
respondent Court declared it had jurisdiction over the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission of evidence, respondent Court then issued
its first challenged Order of April 16, 1969 upholding its jurisdiction on the
ground that petitioner company was engaged in both industrial and agricultural
pursuits and could fall under its jurisdiction or that of the Court of Agrarian
Relations but that having first taken cognizance of the case it has acquired
jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It then scheduled the consent election for <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1969</st1:date> at the premises of <span class="GramE">petitioner
company</span> in <span class="SpellE">Kabasalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
denying dismissal, respondent Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"During the proceedings, it came about that the Philippine
Rubber Project is a business entity engaged in the production of crude rubber,
and the processing, not only of its latex products, but also those of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> and Mindanao Rubber Corporation and <span style="">some </span>other
small rubber planters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A good number of
the <span style="">wor</span>kers involved here are
assigned to the company's processing plant, except during the withering season
when they are invariably transferred or assigned to work in the rubber
fields.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, workers in the
plantation may themselves be assigned in the processing plant, depending on the
need of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
this is a case where the company plays a dual role, one industrial, and the
other agricultural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot even be
said that the employment of industrial workers is merely incidental to the
agricultural phase of the business, because both functions are equally
important, as well as necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Yet, </span>it does not escape the attention
of this Court that the corporation is engaged in an industry, since it was
admitted during the hearing that, as a matter of fact, latex products of other
plantations are being processed by the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The processing of latex products is, no
doubt, industrial, and being so, it necessarily follows that the workers
involved herein are industrial workers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this does not totally erase the fact that the company is likewise
engaged in agricultural pursuit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here
is, therefore, a business concern that is part industrial and part
agricultural.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not <span style="">simply </span>a case of one <span class="GramE">business corporation</span> where one phase is a necessary part of
the other, because both functions, whether agricultural or industrial, are
equally important.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is neither a case
where a categorical classification or a distinction may be made on those who
are agricultural or industrial workers (VICMCO, INC., vs. CIR, FREE VISAYAN
WORKERS G.R. L-17281 March 23, 1963, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Sugar
Mills vs. PASCUAL WORKERS UNIONS G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-7668 </span><st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 28, 1956</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">) because invariably field workers are assigned to the plant and
vice-versa.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Work and assignment
of employees are entirely dependent upon the need of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of this, it is not even established that
workers in the plantations perform agricultural work throughout the year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as borne by the record, they
are oftentimes called and assigned to work in the processing of latex products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="">is
simply </span>no definite pattern that will provide as a guideline for the
Court to segregate the agricultural workers from the ranks of industrial
employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the circumstances, it would certainly be logical to consider
that the employees employed in the processing of latex products or raw rubber
materials are industrial workers and are, no doubt, included in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agricultural workers, however, granting
that they are such, but are, at times, assigned on the plant, may either fall
under the jurisdiction of the Court of Agrarian Relations, or this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, this Court has already taken
cognizance of this case and had actually terminated the hearing of its
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction <span style="">has, </span>therefore, been acquired and if
we are to follow the recent principle enunciated by the Honorable Supreme Court
that the parties must not be allowed to shuttle from one court to another, this
Court should take cognizance of all the allied incidents related to this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="GramE">company</span> rejects the theory of
<span class="SpellE">mootness</span> and contends that if the proceedings before
respondent CIR were null and void for lack of jurisdiction, the nullity cannot
be cured by transfer to the Bureau of Labor Relations, the agency which took
over pending cases of respondent Court when the latter was abolished.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1976</st1:date>,
we deferred action on respondent <span class="SpellE">ALU's</span> Motion to
Dismiss until the Decision on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner ascribes the following assignments of error to
respondent CIR:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>That the Honorable Court of Industrial Relations erred in holding
the processing of latex to be an industrial activity and in exercising jurisdiction
over workers of an agricultural enterprise when all the work performed in such
company is incidental to the production of crude rubber;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>Granting <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that the processing of
latex into crude rubber entails some industrial activity, the Honorable Court
of Industrial Relations still erred in exercising jurisdiction over all
employees of the petitioner some of whom are performing functions undoubtedly
agricultural in nature;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Industrial Relations erred when in the
determination of whether employees involved are agricultural or industrial the
nature of the enterprise in which they were employed was not considered;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>The Honorable Court of Industrial Relations erred when it dismissed
herein petitioner's motion for reconsideration on the basis of trivial
technicalities rather than considering the same <span style="">on the basis of substantial merits.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main issues, therefore, may be framed, thus:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not respondent Court had
jurisdiction over the certification proceedings sought to be held in petitioner
company alleged to be an agricultural enterprise; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not respondent Court erred in
denying petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration on the grounds that it was not
originally filed in the correct number of copies and was not verified as
prescribed by its Rules.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the first issue <span class="GramE">raised</span> now moot and academic under the pertinent provisions
of the Labor Code (PD 442), quoted <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Art. 226.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bureau of Labor
Relations - The Bureau of Labor Relations and labor relations division in the
regional offices of the Department of Labor shall have original and exclusive
autho<span style="">rity to act, at their own
initiative or upon request of either or both parties, on all inter-union and intra-union
conflicts, and all disputes, grievances or problems arising from or affecting
labor-management relations in all workplaces whether <u>agricultural or non-</u></span><u>agricultural</u>,
except those arising from the implementation or interpretation of collective bargaining
agreements which shall be the subject of grievance procedure and/or voluntary
arbitration" (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1 - Where to file - A petition for certification
election may be filed with the Regional Office which has jurisdiction over the <span style="">employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>x <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> "</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, it is clear that labor-management
disputes in all work places, <u>whether agricultural or non-agricultural</u>,
fall within the jurisdiction of the Regional Offices of the Ministry of
Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Agrarian Relations
has been divested of jurisdiction over labor disputes concerning even
agricultural laborers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
contention that it is basically an agricultural company and within the
jurisdictional limits of the Court of Agrarian Relations, or that its employees
are partly agricultural (those working in the plantation) and partly industrial
(those working in the processing plant) and thus fall under the jurisdiction of
both Courts, has become futile considering the clear import of the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Labor Code provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The desire of petitioner company to
characterize the kind of its employees into agricultural or industrial, or
both, for purposes of determining their rate of pay <span class="GramE">is</span>
not proper in these proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
heart of the matter is confined to the question of certification elections and
the proper body to take cognizance of it, an issue already decisively settled
by the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's other contention that respondent CIR erred in
denying its Motion for Reconsideration for non-compliance with Rule 15 of
respondent Court's Rules is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That Rule provided:</p>

<blockquote>"15<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> <span class="SpellE">movant</span> shall file the motion, in
six copies within five (5) days from the date on which he receives notice of
the order or decision, object of the motion for reconsideration, the same to be
verified under oath with respect to the correctness of the allegations of fact,
and serving a copy thereof personally or by registered mail on the adverse
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter may file an answer in
six (6) copies duly verified under oath."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">An examination of the Motion for
Reconsideration in question reveals that it contains no verification and that
the same was originally filed only in two copies instead of six.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioner's "Memorandum in
Support of Motion for Reconsideration" was verified and filed on time and
four more copies of the Motion were filed by petitioner later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This should have been considered substantial
compliance with said Rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
For certification proceedings are not <span class="GramE">a litigation</span> in
the sense that the term is commonly understood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As such, formality and rigidity are altogether lacking.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
However, said error committed <span style="">by </span>respondent
Court accords insufficient basis for the allowance of this Petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">ALU has asked that the records of this case be remanded to the
