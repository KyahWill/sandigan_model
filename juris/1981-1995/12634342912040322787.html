<p class="BODY">A similar petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court was filed
in G.R. No. 82986 to review the decision of public respondent Court of Appeals,
dated 20 January 1988, in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 13252.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

served with summons and (b) the 16 October 1987 Order denying the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion for reconsideration of the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as disclosed by the records in these cases are
not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">High Peak Mining Exploration Corporation (hereinafter referred to
as High Peak), through its duly authorized corporate officers Encarnacion C.
Tittel and Juergen Tittel, borrowed various sums of money from the private
respondent Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the latter acting as trustee of
Trust Account No. 01-139.  The loans are
evidenced by the following Promissory Notes executed on different dates, signed
by the said officers and made payable to the Trust Account:</p>

<blockquote>(1)  On 23 June 1980, the sum of Five Million
Pesos (P5,000,000.00) for a term of 360 days, with interest at 16% per annum
and with a maturity value of P5,800,000.00, under Promissory Note (SER No.
0001);</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  On 14 August 1980, the sum of Three Million
Pesos <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(P3,000,000.00) </span>for a term
of 360 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">days, with interest at 17% per </span>annum
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and with a maturity value of </span>P3,510,000.00,

Million Pesos (P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3,000,000.00) </span>for
a term of 360 days, with interest at 17% per annum and with a maturity value of

12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No security being required, none was put up by High Peak for the
faithful performance of its obligations under the Promissory Notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">These three (3) Promissory Notes expressly provide that demand
and dishonor are waived by High Peak and its officers.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">High Peak failed to pay the said loans.  Despite the waiver of notice of demand, the LBP nevertheless sent
demand letters to the former which ignored the same.  The LBP was thus constrained to take legal action based on the
three (3) Promissory Notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first note became the subject matter of a complaint for the
recovery of a sum of money with an application for a writ of preliminary
attachment filed solely against High Peak.  The complaint was filed on 14 July 1981 with the then Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila.  It was docketed therein as Civil Case No. 82-6235 and was assigned to
Branch 26 thereof.  The case was later
renumbered as Civil Case No. 142400 when Branch 26 became Branch 53 of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila.  The
complaint was thereafter amended to implead as additional defendants the
petitioner herein, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>his
personal capacity and as Chairman of High Peak's Board of Directors, and the
abovenamed signatories to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">the promissory
notes.  </span>The amended complaint was
admitted by the court in its Order of 16 September 1982.  This is the case involved in G.R. No. 79374.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second and third Promissory Notes, on the other hand, became
the subject matter of a complaint for the recovery of a sum of money filed
against High Peak, the herein petitioner in his personal capacity and as
Chairman of High Peak's Board of Directors and the aforementioned signatories
to the three (3) Promissory Notes.  This
complaint was likewise filed on 29 October 1982 with the Court of First
Instance of Manila.  It was docketed as
Civil Case No. 82-13465 and was assigned to Branch 10 thereof.  This is the case involved in G.R. No. 82986.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amended complaint in Civil Case No. 142400 and the complaint
in Civil Case No. 82-13465 both allege that the defendants could be served with
summons at the Second Floor, First Midland Condominium Bldg., Gamboa St.,
Legaspi Village Makati, Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subsequent procedural antecedents in each case are hereunder
summarized.</p>

<p class="BODY">No answer having been filed by the defendants, the trial court,
upon motion of the LBP, issued an order on 15 April 1983 declaring the
defendants in default and ordering the LBP to present its evidence <i>ex-parte</i>.  On 20 September 1983, said court, per Judge
Maximo Savellano, Jr., rendered a decision against the defendants; the latter's
liability for the amount adjudged was made joint and several.  Herein petitioner, as one of the defendants
below, received a copy of the decision in his residence at No. 625 N.S.
Amoranto Ave., Sta. Mesa Heights, Quezon City on 10 December 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 December 1984, petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss and Set
Aside Judgment<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground that service of summons upon him and High Peak was fatally
defective because it was not made in accordance with law.  As to him, the sheriff's return did not show
that the sheriff exerted efforts to personally serve the summons; thus,
substituted service pursuant to Sections 7 and 8, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court
was not warranted.  Petitioner
additionally postulates that even granting that the substituted service was
proper, the actual service upon Susan O. dela Torre cannot be considered valid
because “(a) it was left not at defendant Mapa's residence and dela Torre was
not residing therein, and (b) that he (Mapa) was not holding office or regular
place of business at the second floor, First Midland Condominium Bldg., Gamboa
St., Legaspi Village, Makati, Metro Manila;” he holds office in his
residence.  The motion was denied by the
trial court in its Order of 10 May 1985.  A motion to reconsider the same was likewise denied in the Order of 31
January 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then sought redress from the respondent Court of
Appeals through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> against Judge Savellano and
the LBP.  The case was docketed as
C.A.-G.R. SP No. 08535.  In its decision
promulgated on 3 June 1987,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent Court of Appeals denied the petition on the ground that “x x x
respondent Court was right in assuming jurisdiction over the defendants Tomas
G. Mapa, Encarnacion C. Tittel and Juergen Tittel who were being sued in their
personal capacities, on the basis of its finding that the substituted service
of summons pursuant to Section 8, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court was properly
affected (sic) by Deputy Sheriff Romulo A. Flores.” Respondent Court further
ruled that the service of summons upon Susan O. dela Torre, an employee of the
corporation, may be regarded as service upon <u>an</u> <u>agent</u> of a
corporation within the meaning of Section 13 of Rule 14.  Finally, it took note of the trial court's
observation in the latter's Order of 10 May 1985 that since petitioner Mapa has
not even assailed the merits of the court's 30 September 1983 decision, justice
and equity demanded that “the same should be left undisturbed.”</p>

<p class="BODY">His motion to reconsider the adverse decision having been denied
in the respondent Court’s resolution of 29 July 1987, petitioner filed the
instant petition on 16 September 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">The duty to serve the summons in Civil Case No. 82-13465 also

<p class="BODY">No answer having been filed by the defendants therein, the LBP
filed a motion to declare them in default, which the trial court granted.  On 18 September 1983, said court, per then
Judge Eduardo R. Bengzon, handed down a decision against the defendants.  The latter were adjudged joint and severally
liable for the amounts to be paid.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

on the ground that service of summons to him and the corporation was fatally
defective; he reiterated the same arguments he raised in the similar motion he
filed in Civil Case No. 142400.  Over
the LBP's opposition, the trial court, this time per Judge Josefina Cruz Rodil,
issued an Order on 4 May 1987<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
partly granting the said motion by setting aside the decision because no
jurisdiction was acquired over both the petitioner and High Peak.  The court held that there is no showing that
efforts were exerted by the sheriff to serve the summons personally upon the
petitioner; the former immediately resorted to substituted service upon Susan
O. dela Torre who cannot be considered a competent person in charge of the
office.  With respect to High Peak, Miss
dela Torre, a mere employee thereof, is not one of those explicitly authorized
to receive summons in behalf of a corporation under Section 13, Rule 14 of the
Rules of Court.  It denied, however, the
motion to dismiss; instead, it allowed the petitioner “to file his answer or
responsive pleading within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this Order,” and
directed the issuance of summons on the other defendants<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

filed his opposition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

respect to the aforesaid decision of the Court of Appeals, contends that since
the same is not final, it does not yet control.  The trial court denied the motion in its Order of 16 October
1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

as plaintiff below, should have striven to consolidate Civil Case No. 142400

similar transactions made one after the other and the same trust account of the
LBP.  As a matter of fact, if the filing
of Civil Case No. 142400 had only been delayed by just three (3) months, there
would have been no need <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to file more
than one (1) case.  Moreover, summonses

branches of the trial court and eventually even of the Court of Appeals would
have been saved had the said cases been consolidated pursuant to Section 1,
Rule </span>31 of the Rules of Court.  Parties should avail of this rule both for their own and the court's
advantage and benefit.  The purpose or
object of consolidation is precisely to avoid multiplicity of suits, guard against
oppression or abuse, prevent delay, declog congested dockets, simplify the work
of the trial court and save unnecessary costs or expenses; in short, the aim is
to attain justice with the least expense and vexation to the parties litigants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As stated in the exordium of this <i>ponencia,</i> the basic
issue raised in these petitions is whether or not there was a valid substituted

actions <i>in personam</i>.  Jurisdiction
over the petitioner, as defendant therein, can therefore be acquired either by
his voluntary submission to such jurisdiction, as when he appears in court, or
by service of summons upon him.  Voluntary appearance is equivalent to service of summons;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
in fact, it even cures the defect of summons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Since petitioner did not voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the trial
court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>both cases, personal
service became imperative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court explicitly requires personal
service of summons which is accomplished “by handing a copy thereof to the
defendant in person, or, if he refuses to receive it, by tendering it to him.”
However, if personal service cannot be effected within a reasonable time,
substituted service, as provided for in Section 8 of the abovementioned Rule
14, may suffice:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">“SEC. 8.  </span><i>Substituted service</i>.  -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If
the defendant cannot be served within a reasonable time as provided in the
preceding section, service may be effected (a) by leaving copies of the summons
at the defendant's dwelling house or residence with some person of </span>suitable
age and discretion then residing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">therein,
or (b) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular place of business
with some competent person in charge thereof.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This provision is a reproduction of
Section 8, Rule 7 of the 1940 Rules of Court except that, <i>inter alia</i>,
the word “promptly” in the latter was changed to “within a reasonable time” in
the former.  Of course, “within a
reasonable time” contemplates a period of time longer than that demarcated by
the word “prompt”, and presupposes that a prior attempt at personal service,
within a justifiable time frame as would be necessary to bring the defendant
within the jurisdiction of the court, had failed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not shown when the summonses in Civil Cases Nos. 142400 and
82-13465 were actually issued; what is clear to this Court is that the amended
complaint in the first case was admitted by the trial court on 16 September
1982, while the complaint in Civil Case No. 82-13465 was filed on 29 October
1982.  While the separate Sheriff's
returns indicate that the summonses in both cases were served on <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">10</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span><u>November</u> <u>1982</u>, these returns do not show that
prior attempts at personal service were made by the Sheriff and that such
attempts had failed, prompting the latter to resort to substituted service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Keister vs. Navarro,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court described how the impossibility of personal service should be shown:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Impossibility of prompt service should be shown by stating the efforts
made to find the defendant personally and the fact that such efforts
failed.  This statement should be made
in the proof of service (I Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Ed., p.
444).  This is necessary because
substituted service is in derogation of the usual method of service.  It has been held that this method of service
is ‘in derogation of the common law’; it is a method extraordinary in
character, and hence may be ‘used only as prescribed and in the circumstances
authorized by statute.’ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x </span>x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x </span>(72 C.J.S. 1053).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The proof of service alluded to is the <u>return</u><b><i> </i></b>required
by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 6 of Rule 14 which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 6.  <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Return</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">.  -- </span>When the service
has been completed, the server shall give notice thereof, by registered mail,
to the plaintiff or his counsel, and shall return the summons to the clerk who
issued it, accompanied with the proof of service.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Busuego vs. Court </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of Appeals,</span></i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span></b>this Court also succinctly
expressed how such impossibility is to be shown.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">“x x x </span>Perusal,
however, of the sheriff's return reveals that the sheriff failed to specify
therein what prior efforts if any, had been exerted to serve summons upon the
other defendants personally within a reasonable period of time, and the lack of
success of such efforts, before proceeding to substituted service.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x </span>x”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier adverted to, the sheriff's returns in Civil Cases Nos.
142400 and 82-13465 are patently wanting in particulars that would justify the
substituted service.  Accordingly, it is
fatally flawed and defective; on that basis alone, therefore, the trial court
acquired no jurisdiction over the person of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must nevertheless be emphasized that the absence in the
sheriff's return of a statement about the impossibility of personal service
does not conclusively prove that the service is invalid.  Proof of prior attempts at personal service
may be submitted by the plaintiff during the hearing of any incident assailing
the validity of the substituted service.  While the sheriff's return carries with it the presumption, albeit
disputable, of regularity in the sense that <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">inter alia</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>the
entries therein are deemed correct, it does not necessarily follow that an act
done in relation to the official duty for which the return is made was not done
simply because it is not disclosed therein.  Besides, the sheriff's neglect in making such a disclosure should not
unduly prejudice the plaintiff if what was undisclosed was in fact done.  Unfortunately in these <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">instant </span>cases, the private respondent
failed to present evidence during the hearings of the petitioner's separate
motions to dismiss and set aside judgment to prove that substituted service of
summons was indeed effected in strict compliance with Section 8, Rule 14 of the
Rules of Court.  During such hearings,
the private respondent could also have presented evidence to show that the
petitioner did in fact receive from Susan O. dela Torre the summonses, together
with copies of the complaints, in both cases.  If indeed the petitioner received the same, the requirement of due
process would have been complied with.  Thus, in <i>Boticano vs. Chu,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this </span>Court had the occasion to state:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">“In </span>the case at bar,
there is no question that summons was timely issued and received by private
respondent.  In fact, he never denied
actual receipt of such summons but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">confined
</span>himself to the argument that the Sheriff should prove that personal
service was first made before resorting to substituted service.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This brings to the fore the question of procedural due
process.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">In </span><i>Montalban vs. Maximo</i> (22 SCRA 1077 [1968]) the Court
ruled that ‘The constitutional requirement of due process exacts that the
service be such as may be reasonably expected to give the notice desired.  Once the service provided by the rules
reasonably accomplishes that end, the requirement of justice is answered; the
traditional notions of fair play are satisfied; due process is served.’<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, such construction is but fair, and in accord with
substantial justice.  The burden on a
plaintiff is not to be enlarged with a restrictive construction desired by the
defendant.  (Ibid., p. 1078).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same matter, Moran<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> has
this to say:</p>

<blockquote>“Irregularities of this kind may, however, be cured by proof that
the copies have actually been delivered to the defendant, which is equivalent to
personal service.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While in his separate motions to dismiss and set aside judgment
in the two (2) cases filed before the trial court and annexed to his pleadings
in these petitions, petitioner never alleged that he did not in fact receive
the summonses, such circumstance by itself cannot warrant the conclusion that
he actually received from Susan dela Torre the said summonses and copies of the
complaints.  In the absence of a
categorical admission similar to that made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Boticano vs. </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Chu,</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>no such inference to the contrary could be drawn.  It was thus incumbent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">upon </span>the private respondent to prove
that Susan dela Torre delivered to the petitioner copies of both the summonses
and the complaints.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion then is inevitable that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">neither </span>a valid personal nor substituted service of summons in
Civil Cases Nos. 142400 and 82-13465 had been effected on the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, Branch 10 of the RTC of Manila gravely erred when, in
its Order of 4 May 1987, it set aside the decision of 18 September 1983 because
it was also of the opinion that there was no valid service of summons on High
Peak and the other defendants.  It
entirely forgot that it was only the petitioner herein who filed a motion to
dismiss and set aside the judgment.  For
reasons which remain undisclosed, petitioner did not include his co-defendants
in the said motion.  In any event, the
validity of the service of summonses on Encarnacion Tittel and Juergen Tittel
has not been raised in issue; moreover, based on the sheriff’s return of
service in said case, this Court is satisfied that there was a valid service of
summons on High Peak.  Section 13, Rule
14 of the Rules of Court provides for the manner in which service of summons
upon a private domestic corporation shall be made.  It reads:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 13.  <i>Service upon
private domestic corporation or partnership</i>.  -- If the defendant is a corporation organized under the laws of
the Philippines or a partnership duly registered, service may be made on the
president, manager, secretary, cashier, agent, or any of its directors.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rationale for the above rule is to render it reasonably
certain that the corporation will receive prompt and proper notice in an action
against it or to insure that the summons be served on a representative so
integrated with the corporation that such a person will know what to do with
the legal papers served on him.  In
other words, the rule is meant to bring home to the corporation notice of the
filing of the action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The summonses for High Peak in Civil Cases Nos. 142400 and
82-13465 were received by Susan O. dela Torre who is described in the separate
sheriff's returns as “a person of suitable age and discretion working therein,
who claims to be the person authorized to receive processess (sic) of this
nature and who acknowledged the receipt thereof at second (sic) floor, First
Midland Condominium Bldg., Gamboa Street, Legaspi Village, Makati, Metro
Manila.” In his separate motions to dismiss, while petitioner categorically
admits that this Susan O. dela Torre is an employee of the corporation, he does
not disclose her specific duties and responsibilities.  He does not even deny the statement, made in
the said returns, that Susan is “authorized to receive processess (sic) of this
nature.” Until rebutted by competent evidence, these returns would have to
stand in the meantime for they enjoy the presumption of regularity.  Susan O. dela Torre may thus be deemed an <u>agent</u>
of High Peak for purposes of the aforesaid Section 13 of Rule 14.  It is then logical to presume that she
delivered the copies of the summonses and complaints to the corporation,
considering especially the fact that she was working in the office of the said
corporation as indicated in the complaints.  This latter presumption has not likewise been rebutted.  Accordingly, even if Miss dela Torre may not
strictly be considered as the proper agent for purposes of the aforecited
Section 13, there was, nonetheless, substantial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">compliance therewith.  In </span><i>G&amp;G
Trading Corporation vs. Court of Appeals,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this Court stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Although it may be true that the service of summons was made on a
person not authorized to receive the same in behalf of the petitioner,
nevertheless since it appears that the summons and complaint were in fact
received by the corporation, through its said clerk, the Court finds that there
was substantial compliance with the rule on service of summons.  Indeed the purpose of said rule as above
stated to assure service of summons on the corporation had thereby been
attained.  The need for speedy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">justice must prevail over a </span>technicality.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One final word.  As stated
earlier, the three (3) promissory notes involving, the original amounts of
P5,000,000.00, P3,000,000.00 and P3,000,000.00, or a total of P11,000,000.00,
were to be released as loans from a Trust Account of the LBP unsecured by
mortgage or any other security.  This
Court is unable to understand how Eleven Million Pesos -- an enormous amount --
can be so easily released without any form of security.  Unless allowed by the Trust Account itself
or the rules and regulations of the LBP, the transactions appear to be highly
questionable.  In this regard, since
private respondent LBP is a government-owned institution, an inquiry by
appropriate agencies of the government is in order to determine who were
responsible for the approval of said loans.</p>
