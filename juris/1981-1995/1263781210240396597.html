the decision of the defunct Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental in Civil Case No. 8284 dismissing plaintiff-appellant's money claim
for lack of a cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="18" month="8"><span style="">August
 18, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">Salvador </span><span style="">de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, one of the incorporators of the <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Inc. filed a
complaint with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental docketed as Civil Case No. 8284, concerning a money claim against
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> who is his own nephew and purchaser of
his shares of stock in aforesaid corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
alleged that the <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
Inc. suffered damages during the last war and had an approved war damage claim
with the Philippine War Damage Commission in the sum of P106<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first payment on said claim, in the sum
of P56<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which was paid by the Commission while
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> was still a stockholder, was, upon
resolution of the majority of its stockholders, used for the reconstruction of
the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Iris</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Theater</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On November 18, 1958, before the additional liquidation of said claim, De
la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> sold to <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> at
par value his 140 shares in the corporation by endorsing his cer足tificates of
stock in favor of the latter with an alleged understanding that <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> reserved to himself his
proportionate equity in the war damage benefits due on his 140 shares which <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> promised to deliver to him upon payment by the
Foreign Claim Settlement Commission of the United States.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon presentation of the endorsed shares of
stock, new certificates of stock were issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="">, the corpora足tion received a final payment
of its war damage claim in the sum of P46<span class="GramE">,696.33</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board of Directors passed </span><span style="">a resolution distributing the final payment
received by said corporation among its stockholders of record </span><span style="">as </span>of <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1965</st1:date>, as dividend computed at P29.59 per
share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>
received the dividends pertaining to his total shareholding including the 140
shares he had purchased from De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, the latter
demanded from the former the return and <span style="">delivery
</span>to him of his corres足ponding share in the claim in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> refused and
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> filed subject complaint alleging that he
suffered moral and exemplary damages in the sum of not less than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and attorney's fees in the sum of P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Complaint, Record on
Appeal, pp. 1-6; Decision of CFI <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> <span class="SpellE">Occ</span>., Record on Appeal, pp. 18-20.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><span style="">his answer, <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>
admits the allegation in </span>the complaint except:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the alleged verbal understanding between
De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> and himself regarding the unpaid war damage
claim; (b) the alleged equity of De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> in the
said claim as such equity is with the corporation itself, and not with the
stockholders individually; and <span style="">(c) </span>his
liability for either moral or exemplary damages, much less for attorney's fees,
the same having no basis at all in law or in fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By way of special defense, <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> claimed that the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>
by De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> of the Stock Certificate in question
without qualification or condition constituted the sole and exclusive contract
between the parties and to allow De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to prove
any alleged simultaneous oral agreement would run counter to the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence Rule and the Statute of Frauds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the unpaid balance on the said
corporation's <span style="">war </span>damage claim
at the time De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> sold his share足<span style="">holdings </span>belonged to the corporation
itself and not to its stockholders and so was the final payment which was paid
to the corporation itself, for its Board of Directors to do what it deemed
best.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Answer, Record
on Appeal, pp. 8-11.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In reply to the special
defenses raised by <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>, De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
avers:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the War Damage Payment
made </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">the government of the United States to
claimants in the Philippines who suffered losses during World War II is not a
profit of the Corporation which can be distributed as dividends; the use and
disposition of said funds as specified by the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of
1946 are reserved for those who suffered losses during the war like himself;
(b) that the Statute of Frauds applies only to <span class="SpellE">Executory</span>
Contracts, and not </span><span style="">to partially
or </span><span style="">fully consummated cases; and
(c) that the </span>instant case is exempted from the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span>
Evidence Rule since the writing fails to express the true intent and agreement
of the parties, and this fact is pleaded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He further stated that the war damage benefits while due to the
corporation redounds to the benefit of the stockholders who actually suffered
the damage, which means the stockholders of record at the time the damage was
inflicted; that in the disposition of such benefits the Board of Directors
should be guided by the spirit and letter of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act
of 1946 and that the oral agreement of the parties is consistent with the trust
and confidence of the parties at the time in view of their close blood relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp.
12-16.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the pre-trial of this
case, the parties, through counsel, agreed to submit for the resolution of the
Court the question as to whether or not De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> is
allowed to present <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence to prove his
alleged reservation to the war damage benefits </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties further agreed that should the
ruling of the Court be in the negative, then the Court may render judgment on
the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, should the Court
rule in favor of admissibility of <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence, a
hearing on the merits will be scheduled for the admission of the evidence of
both <span class="GramE">parties.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, <span style="">pp. </span>18-19.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court ruled in
the negative, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the foregoing circumstances, the Court believes that
any evidence tending to establish the plaintiff's cause of action would be
inadmissible under the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule and the
provisions of the Statute of Frauds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the light of the facts not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> in the
pleading submitted by the parties, the Court finds that the plaintiff has no
cause of action against the defendant." <span class="GramE">(Record on
Appeal, <span style="">pp. </span>25-26.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From this decision, the
plaintiff-appellant appealed, and raised the following assignment of errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in holding that defendant is a successor in
interest of plaintiff's appellant's equitable share in the war damage benefits
granted to <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>,
Inc. by operation of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act of 1946 and of the
United States Public Law 87-616.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in not holding that plaintiff, as the pre-war
shareholder of the <span class="SpellE">Inocentes</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, Inc. and registered owner of shares of stock in the
said corporation up to the year 1958, is the claimant having unpaid balance due
on awards as determined by the former Philip<span style="">pine War Damage Commission prior to its abolishment in April 1951 by
operation of the above stated laws.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in holding that the verbal agreement of the
herein parties in which <span class="GramE">plaintiff</span> reserved and the
defendant agreed to the right of Plaintiff to the balance of the war <span style="">damage claim at the time of plaintiff's sale
of his share </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">stock to defendant in 1958 is </span><span style="">barred </span><span style="">by the Statute of Frauds and the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span>
Evidence Rule.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal is without
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue crucial to this appeal is whether or not the
alleged verbal agreement of the parties concerning plaintiff's reservation of
his right to the balance of <span style="">the </span>war
damage claim at the time of the sale of his shares to the defendant, can be
proven by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence under the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence <span style="">Rule </span>and
the Statute <span style="">of Frauds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> contention
that the alleged oral reservation and the sale of the shares of stock were made
simultaneously and contemporaneously, so that to allow De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> to prove the same would run counter to the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence Rule.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his brief, appellant
alleged that "at the time he sold his shares of stock to the defendant in
1958 he has reserved to himself the said benefits and to which defendant
agreed." <span class="GramE">(Brief for Appellant, p. 3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, in his third </span><span style="">assignment </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">error he claims that
the lower court erred in holding that the disputed oral </span><span style="">reservation, cannot </span><span style="">be proved under the Statute of Frauds and the
<span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence." (<span class="GramE">Ibid.,</span>
p. </span><span style="">ii.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a well accepted
principle of law that evidence of a prior or contemporaneous verbal agreement
is generally not admissible to vary, contradict or defeat the </span><span style="">operation </span><span style="">of a valid instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(American
Factors (Phil.) Inc. </span><span style="">vs. Murphy</span><span style=""> Tire Corporation, et al. <span class="GramE">(</span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">C.A.</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="">) </span>49 O.G. <span style="">189</span></span><span style="">.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence is admissible in a variety of ways to explain the meaning of written
contracts, it cannot serve the purpose of incorporating into the contract
additional contemporaneous conditions which are </span><u><span style="">not mentioned</span></u><span style=""> at </span><span style="">all in the writing, unless there has been fraud or </span><span style="">mistake. <span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">(Yu <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> &amp; </span><span style="">Co. </span><span style="">v. Gonzales, </span>Phil. 384.)</span> Indeed the exceptions to the
rule do not apply in the instant case, there being no intrinsic ambiguity or
fraud, mistakes, or failure to express the true agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed the alleged reservation had been
intended, businessmen like the parties would have placed in writing such an
important reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, nowhere in the complaint were the exceptions
to the rule alleged or put in issue (See <span class="SpellE">Infante</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, et al., 93 Phil. 691).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged reservation
not being admissible under the <span class="SpellE">Parol</span> Evidence Rule,
WE do not find it necessary to discuss the applicability or non-applicability
to </span><span style="">the present case </span><span style="">of the statute of </span><span style="">Frauds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the same reason We </span><span style="">see no reason </span><span style="">for resolving whether the war damage award </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">favor of the corporation should be regarded as capital stock or
profit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Whether the </span><span style="">award </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">be</span></span><span style=""> part of one or the other the fact </span>is
that <span style="">appellant </span><span style="">is </span>not entitled to <span style="">share </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the same, having
already disposed of his equity in favor of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
