				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">These are petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with a prayer for a restraining order and/or injunction urging this Court (a) to review and annul the resolutions of respondent Sandiganbayan in Civil Case No. 0035 entitled <i>Republic of the Philippines vs. Benjamin (Kokoy) Romualdez, et al.</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of 28 October 1988 denying the separate motions to dismiss filed by petitioners and of 20 January 1989 denying the separate motions for reconsideration filed by them, and (b) to issue an order commanding respondent Sandiganbayan to desist from further proceeding in Civil Case No. 0035.&nbsp;

Hereunder are set out the reasons to support Our ruling.<br><br><i>Firstly,</i> the instant action is a civil suit for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth filed in accordance with Executive Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 14, as amended, enacted pursuant to Section 1 (d), Article II of Proclamation No. 3, dated March 25, 1986, otherwise known as the Freedom Constitution (For reference, see pertinent Resolution in <i>Republic vs. Lucio Tan, et al.</i>, Civil Case No. 0005).&nbsp; It is completely separate and distinct from the proceedings contemplated in Republic Act No. 1379, hence, 'no previous, inquiry similar to preliminary investigation in criminal cases' need be conducted.&nbsp; Considering the purely civil nature of the instant case, the rules on procedure apply.&nbsp; Consequently, the requirements of due process and fairness, due notice, hearing and opportunity to adduce evidence are matters which are involved prior to the filing of the complaint, since such filing connotes that a <i>prima facie</i> case had been found and determined by the PCGG in accordance with its Rules and Regulations promulgated on April 11, 1986.<br><br><i>Secondly,</i> a motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action admits, for the purpose of the motion, the truth of all facts well pleaded in the pleading attached and, likewise, any inferences fairly deducible therefrom.&nbsp; In other words, it hypothetically admits the truth of the allegations of fact made in the complaint (<i>Pinero vs. Enriquez,</i> 84 Phil. 774).&nbsp; The test is whether or not, admitting the facts alleged, the Court could render a valid judgment in accordance with the prayer in the complaint (De Jesus vs. Belarmino, 95 Phil. 365).&nbsp; Any factual issues raised in plaintiff's cause of action should be the subject of a full-dress trial (<i>Socorro vs. Vargas</i>, 25 SCRA 592).&nbsp; The complaint in the instant case, original and expanded, contains five (5) causes of action, based not only on 'General Averments' but also on ‘Specific Averments of Defendants’ Illegal Acts’ (Paragraphs 15, (a) to (i) and 16).&nbsp; Perusal thereof clearly support (sic) the view that the Expanded Complaint, indeed, state (sic) valid and sufficient causes of action, wherein alleged violations of legal rights by the defendants are averred (Please refer to <i>Ma-ao Sugar Central Co. vs. Barrios</i>, 79 Phil. 667, <i>Militante vs. Edrosolano</i>, 39 SCRA 489).<br><br><i>Thirdly,</i> the jurisdiction of this Court over the persons of the defendants-movants and the subject matter of the Expanded Complaint in the instant cases, as well as in other cases of the same nature pending before all three Division (sic) of this Court, cannot be validly disputed or objected to.&nbsp; Executive Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 14, as amended, constitute the very roots and sources of Our authority to accept the filing of complaints for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; Once it is shown that said complaints are filed within the time constraints provided in the 1987 Constitution, (Sections 26, 27 and Article XVIII of the Transitory Provisions), this Court is vested with the appropriate authority to try and decide the issues raised therein.&nbsp; (Sections 2 and 3, Executive Order No. 14, as amended).&nbsp; The original and exclusive jurisdiction of this Court over cases for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth accumulated by the persons mentioned in Executive Orders Nos. 1 and 2 have been expressly confirmed by the Hon. Supreme Court in the leading cases of <i>Bataan Shipyard &amp; Engineering Co., Inc. (BASECO) vs. PCGG, et al.</i> (G.R. No. 75885, June 30, 1988); <i>PCGG vs. Hon. Emmanuel G. Peña, et al.</i> (G.R. No. 77663, April 12, 1988); and <i>Ofelia Trinidad vs. PCGG, et al.</i> (G.R. No. 77695, June 16, 1988); <i>Soriano, et al. vs. Hon. Mannel</i> (sic) <i>Yuzon, Eduardo Cojuangco, et al. vs. SEC, et al.</i>, and <i>Clifton Ganay vs. PCGG.</i>&nbsp; (G.R. Nos. 74910, 75075, 75094, 76397, 79549 and 75250, August 10, 1988).&nbsp; Lately, the Hon. Supreme Court upheld the dismissal by this Court of the motion to dismiss filed by J. Chua, one of the defendants in the Binondo Central Bank case (PCGG Case No. 0017) questioning the service of summons and the Amended Complaint upon him.&nbsp; (G.R. No. 83428, July 29, 1988).<br><br><i>Fourthly,</i> neither do We find valid and/or justified the objections to the constitution and membership of the PCGG when the instant case was filed, it being seemingly indicative of a bankruptcy of argumentation.&nbsp; Nor are there any taint (sic) of unconstitutionality (re:&nbsp; equal protection, bill of attainder or <i>ex post facto</i> law), considering that (1) a reasonable standard or classification exist (sic) wherein persons similarly situated are charged and accorded due process; (2) the sequestration, freeze/hold orders and provisional takeover are mere provisional remedies applicable generally and/or peculiarly to unearthed instances of ill-gotten wealth; (3) there are (sic) no preclusion of enactments imparting penal or criminal taint to conduct bereft of such character, and, (4) no divestment of title over property seized (<i>BASECO vs. PCGG, supra</i>)."</blockquote>Petitioners' separate motions to reconsider the same having been denied by respondent Sandiganbayan in its resolution of 20 January 1989 on the ground that they are repetitions of the arguments in the motion to dismiss and that the resolution of 28 October 1988 amply discussed and disposed of the same, petitioners separately filed the instant petitions.<br><br>The antecedent facts and proceedings generative of the instant petitions are as follows:<br><br>On 31 July 1987, the Republic of the Philippines, represented by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG), assisted by the Solicitor General, filed a complaint with the respondent Sandiganbayan (SB) against Benjamin (Kokoy) Romualdez and forty-four others<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> for, as stated under the heading <i>Nature of the Action</i>, recovery of "ill-gotten wealth consisting of funds and other property which they, in unlawful concert with one another, had acquired and accumulated in flagrant breach of trust and of their fiduciary obligations as public officers, with grave abuse of rights and power and in brazen violation of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines, thus resulting in their unjust enrichment during Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos’ 20 years of rule from December 30, 1965 to February 25, 1986 x x x." It is further alleged therein that "the wrongs committed by defendants, acting singly and collectively, and in unlawful concert with one another, include the misappropriation and theft of public funds, plunder of the nation's wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement and other acts of corruption, betrayal of public trust and brazen abuse of power."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>The above complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 0035.&nbsp; It underwent three (3) amendments.&nbsp; The Amended Complaint was filed on 20 August 1987;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> the Second Amended Complaint was filed on 4 November 1987;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and the Second Amended Complaint, as expanded upon appropriate motion duly approved by respondent SB, was filed on 20 January 1988.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>This expanded Second Amended Complaint, which maintains the allegations under the heading <i>Nature of the Action</i> in the original and the Amended complaints, impleads as additional co-defendants Jose F.S.

Marcos, together with other Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, in flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations as public officers, with gross and scandalous abuse of right and power and in brazen violation of the Constitution and laws of the Philippines, embarked upon a systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth;<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Upon his unfettered discretion and sole authority, for the purpose of implementing the plan referred to above, Defendant Ferdinand E.

<i>First Cause of Action</i>:&nbsp; BREACH OF PUBLIC TRUST — A public office is a public trust.&nbsp; By committing all the acts described above, Defendants repeatedly breached public trust and the law, making them jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff.&nbsp; The funds and other property acquired by Defendants following, or as a result of, their breach of public trust are deemed to have been acquired for the benefit of Plaintiff and are, therefore, impressed with constructive trust in favor of Plaintiff and the Filipino people.&nbsp; Consequently, Defendants are solidarily liable to return or reconvey to Plaintiff all such funds and property thus impressed with constructive trust for the benefit of Plaintiff and the Filipino people;<br><br>20.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Second Cause of Action</i>:&nbsp; ABUSE OF RIGHT AND POWER — (a) Defendants, in perpetrating the unlawful acts described above, committed abuse of right and power which caused untold misery, sufferings and damages to Plaintiff.&nbsp; Defendants violated, among others, Articles 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code of the Philippines;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of the foregoing acts, Defendants acquired title to and the beneficial interest in funds and other property and concealed such title, funds and interests through the use of relatives, business associates, nominees, agents or dummies.&nbsp; Defendants are, therefore, jointly and severally, liable to Plaintiff to return and reconvey all such funds and other property unlawfully acquired, or alternatively, to pay Plaintiff, jointly and severally, by way of indemnity, the damage caused to Plaintiff equivalent to the amount of such funds or the value of other property not returned or restored to Plaintiff, plus interest thereon from the date of unlawful acquisition until full payment.<br><br>21.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Third Cause of Action</i>:&nbsp; UNJUST ENRICHMENT — Defendants illegally accumulated funds and other property in violation of the laws of the Philippines and in breach of their official functions and fiduciary obligations.&nbsp; Defendants, therefore, have unjustly enriched themselves to the grave and irreparable damage and prejudice of Plaintiff.&nbsp; Defendants have an obligation at law, independently of breach of trust and abuse of right and power and, as an alternative, to jointly and severally return to Plaintiff such funds and other property with which Defendants, in gross evident bad faith, have unjustly enriched themselves or, in default thereof, restore to Plaintiff the amount of such funds and the value of the other property including those which may have been wasted, and/or lost, with interest thereon from the date of unlawful acquisition until full payment;<br><br>22.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fourth Cause of Action</i>:&nbsp; ACCOUNTING — The Commission, acting pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, respectfully maintains that Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, acquired funds, assets and property during the incumbency of Defendant public officers, manifestly out of proportion to their salaries, to their other lawful income and income from legitimately acquired property.&nbsp; Consequently, they are required to show to the satisfaction of this Honorable Court that they have lawfully acquired all such funds, assets and property which are in excess of their legal net income, and for this Honorable Court to decree that the Defendants are under obligation to account to Plaintiff with respect to all legal or beneficial interest in funds, properties and assets of whatever kind and wherever located in excess of the lawful earnings or lawful income from legitimately acquired property;<br><br>23.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fifth Cause of Action</i>:&nbsp; LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES — (a) By reason of the unlawful acts set forth above, Plaintiff and the Filipino people have suffered actual damages in an amount representing the pecuniary loss sustained by the latter as a result of Defendants' unlawful acts, the approximate value and interest on which from the time of their wrongful acquisition, plus expenses which Plaintiff has been compelled to incur and shall continue to incur in its effort to recover Defendants' ill-gotten wealth all over the world.&nbsp; Defendants are, therefore, jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff for actual damages and for expenses incurred in the recovery of Defendants' ill-gotten wealth;<br><br>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result of Defendants' unlawful, malicious, immoral and wanton acts described above, Plaintiff and the Filipino people had painfully endured and suffered for more than twenty long years, and still continue to endure and suffer anguish, fright, sleepless nights, serious anxiety, wounded feelings and moral shock, as well as besmirched reputation and social humiliation before the international community, for which Defendants are jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff and the Filipino people for moral damages;<br><br>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, Plaintiff and the Filipino people are entitled to temperate damages for their sufferings which, by their very nature, are incapable of pecuniary estimation, but which this Honorable Court may determine in the exercise of its sound discretion;<br><br>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Defendants, by reason of the above described unlawful acts, have violated and invaded the inalienable right of Plaintiff and the Filipino people to a fair and decent way of life befitting a Nation with rich natural and human resources.&nbsp; This basic and fundamental right of Plaintiff and the Filipino people should be recognized and vindicated by awarding nominal damages in an amount to be determined by the Honorable Court in the exercise of its sound discretion;<br><br>(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;

A bill of attainder is a legislative act which inflicts punishment without judicial trial.&nbsp; Its essence is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of guilt.<br><br>In the first place, nothing in the executive orders can be reasonably construed as a determination or declaration of guilt.&nbsp; On the contrary, the executive orders, inclusive of Executive Order No. 14, make it perfectly clear that any judgment of guilt in the amassing or acquisition of ‘ill-gotten wealth’ is to be handed down by a judicial tribunal, in this case the <i>Sandiganbayan</i>, upon complaint filed and prosecuted by the PCGG.&nbsp; In the second place, no punishment is inflicted by the executive orders, as the merest glance at their provisions will immediately make apparent.&nbsp; In no sense, therefore, may the executive orders be regarded as a bill of attainder (sic)."</blockquote>Equally untenable is the claim that the PCGG Charter is <i>ex post facto</i> because it alters the legal rules of evidence and receives less or different testimony than what the law required at the time of the commission of the offense in order to convict the offender.<br><br>For both the civil and criminal cases covered by the PCGG Charter, nothing has been altered in terms of the quantum of proof required for an adverse judgment against the defendants or a judgment of conviction against the accused, respectively.&nbsp;

Virata and Placido Mapa, Jr. have been carelessly thrown into a conspiracy net with 43 other persons for no apparent reason except their having been ranking officials who necessarily had to participate in many official acts of the past Administration.<br><br>The PCGG in the name of the Republic, has come up with general and sweeping averments regarding ill-gotten wealth, plunder, extortion, blackmail, and various kinds of diabolical evils committed against the Filipino people.<br><br>I have no objection to the prosecution of the cases against some of the persons named in the complaint.&nbsp; What disturbs me is the reckless inclusion of the petitioners who, on the basis of the pleadings, cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered presumably guilty with some others.&nbsp; In denying the petition, the Court has validated a dangerous political act, not of the President or her Cabinet, but lesser functionaries who have fecklessly filed only one case against 45 persons whose acts are diverse and unconnected and whose individual degrees of culpability or innocence are kilometers apart.&nbsp; To validate an act of oppressive harassment against a high official of a past Administration simply because the prosecuting officials detest that administration runs counter to every principle of fair play, reconciliation, and simple justice which we are sworn to uphold.<br><br>What the PCGG is doing when it includes the petitioners with 43 other respondents in this case is to set up a more sinister version of the <i>residencia</i> during early Spanish colonial times.&nbsp; In the <i>residencia</i>, the outgoing officials of the colonial administration were subjected to a judicial examination and required to explain their acts while still in power.&nbsp; Never mind if they are innocent.&nbsp; They must be judicially examined.<br><br>In this case, the former Prime Minister, one of the most decent and dedicated persons to ever hold high public office, is charged with all kinds of fancied offenses with no statements of ultimate facts.&nbsp; He is being asked to defend himself for alleged illegal acts of the former President with no clear showing of how he happens to be responsible for the commission of those generalized offenses.&nbsp; Mr. Virata is charged with offenses related to the illegal accumulation of vast wealth and plunder, with not the slightest indication where his wealth is stashed, how he accumulated it, or how he knowingly and willfully helped others in raiding the national treasury.<br><br>What are the general averments of illegal acts allegedly committed by the 45 defendants, the two petitioners included.<br><br>It is charged, among others, that the defendants:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; Acted singly or collectively and in unlawful concert with one another in the <i>misappropriation and theft</i> of public funds, <i>plunder</i> of the nation's wealth, <i>extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement</i> and other acts of <i>corruption, betrayal of public trust and brazen abuse of power.</i><br><br>(2)&nbsp; Acted as <i>dummies</i>, nominees, or agents of Benjamin (Kokoy) Romualdez, Ferdinand E. Marcos, and Imelda R. Marcos.<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Conspired with former President Marcos in the latter's embarking upon a systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Conspired in preventing disclosure and avoiding discovery of the unmitigated plunder of the National Treasury.&nbsp; They conspired in the deposit and investment of funds, securities, and other assets estimated at billions of US dollars in various banks, financial institutions, trust or investment companies and with persons here and abroad.<br><br>More specifically, Mr. Virata is charged with:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; Actively collaborating with Benjamin (Kokoy) Romualdez, Juliette Gomez Romualdez, Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos to justly enrich themselves by giving MERALCO undue advantage through the reduction of the electric franchise tax from 5% to 2% of gross receipts and the tariff duty on fuel oil imports by public utilities from 20% to 10%.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Actively collaborating with others in securing the approval by President Marcos and <i>his Cabinet</i> of the "Three-Year Program for the Extension of MERALCO's Services to Areas Within the 60 Kilometer Radius of Manila."<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Collaborating in the manipulation of the formation of Erectors Holdings, Inc. so it could assume the obligations of Erectors, Inc. with Philguarantee in the amount of P527,387,440.71 with insufficient securities or collaterals.<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Acting as dummy, nominee, or agent to be used as an instrument in accumulating ill-gotten wealth through government concessions, orders, or policies prejudicial to the Republic of the Philippines, or as an incorporator, director, or member of corporations held or controlled by Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Benjamin Romualdez and Juliette Romualdez.<br><br>I note from the records that the reduction of the franchise tax from 5% to 3% of gross receipts was intended for all electric companies and was effected through P.D. 551.&nbsp; The Decree also reduced the tariff on fuel oils.&nbsp; The Decree was applicable to all grantees of electric franchises and was intended to benefit consumers.&nbsp; Its implementation was left to the Board of Energy.&nbsp; In <i>Philippine Consumer Foundation, Inc. v. Board of Energy and Meralco</i> (G.R. No. 63018, October 22, 1985) this Court sustained the validity of P.D. 551.&nbsp; Justice Claudio Teehankee himself, who filed a dissent, agreed with the objectives of the Decree.&nbsp; The Decree enacted by Mr. Marcos is in force up to the present and I cannot see why Mr. Virata should answer a harassment suit under the circumstances.<br><br>The expansion program authorized for MERALCO was intended to benefit consumers who had to pay exhorbitant rates to small companies servicing them.&nbsp; The program continues to the present.&nbsp; MERALCO like the MWSS is constantly expanding.&nbsp; So is the program of the National Power Corporation, actively endorsed by President Aquino, to takeover inefficient electric cooperatives in various parts of the country.&nbsp; The expansion program of MERALCO was studied and endorsed by the entire Marcos Cabinet.&nbsp; To hold Mr. Virata solely responsible for an act which is manifestly not criminal or disadvantageous to the common people is an act of harassment.&nbsp; The petitioner points out that today NEDA presided over by the President has approved P880,200,000.00 of government financing for the MERALCO expansion program.&nbsp; The expansion continues.<br><br>The alleged role of Mr. Virata in the formation of Erectors Holdings, Inc. (EHI) is pure innuendo, inference, and speculation.&nbsp; There is no allegation of facts showing the character of his involvement in organizing the company or that he had knowledge of or was privy to the Romualdezes intentions in setting it up.&nbsp; The PCGG is playing loose with mere inferences and conclusions, substituting suspicions and conjectures for averments of a legal causal relation between facts set forth in the pleadings.&nbsp; (See <i>Alzua, et al. v. Johnson</i>, 21 Phil. 308 [1912]).<br><br>Alleging that Mr. Virata acted as a dummy for Mr. Marcos or Mr. Romualdez is a conclusion.&nbsp; Without a statement of ultimate facts supporting it, there is no cause of action.&nbsp; Anyone among thousands of Filipinos whom the PCGG dislikes could be singled out by it as a dummy or agent of Mr. Marcos.&nbsp; To accuse is one thing.&nbsp; To have a rational basis for the accusation is another.<br><br>The charges against Mr. Mapa are equally murky.<br><br>The same sweeping allegations are levelled against him, of having conspired in the misappropriation and theft of public funds, plunder of the nation's wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement, and brazen abuse of power.<br><br>There is only one allegation of an actionable wrong against Mr. Mapa.&nbsp; He allegedly acted as a dummy and allowed himself to be used as an instrument in the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth or to be an incorporator or director of corporations controlled by Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Benjamin Romualdez and Juliette Romualdez.<br><br>The complaint charges that Mr. Mapa was a dummy because he was "an incorporator, director, or member of corporations beneficially held or controlled by defendants Ferdinand Marcos, Imelda Marcos, Benjamin Romualdez and Juliette Romualdez" in order "to conceal and prevent recovery of assets illegally obtained."<br><br>The corporations are not named.&nbsp; I am not aware of any law or precedent which declares it an offense or actionable wrong to be a stockholder or even director of a corporation, the majority ownership of which happens to belong to an alleged wrong doer.&nbsp; A cause of action must state the ultimate facts to show the guilty knowledge or participation of a defendant.&nbsp; To say he is a dummy is not only a conclusion but requires the defendant to engage in pure and unmitigated speculation.&nbsp; It is worse because the corporations where his membership is supposed to be that of a dummy are not even indicated.<br><br>I see from the records that Mr. Mapa is prosecuted for only one reason — he shared his professional competence in economics and finance with Government.&nbsp; We allow a dangerous precedent when we allow the harassment of two individuals by validating their inclusion with 43 defendants, some of whom may be properly proceeded against.<br><br>As early as <i>Kwong Sing v. City of Manila</i> (41 Phil. 103 [1920]) and <i>Dimayuga , et al. v. Fernandez</i> (43 Phil. 304 [1022]), this Court has applied the rule that prohibition should issue where it is necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive or vindictive manner, or to stop harassments through a multiplicity of actions.<br><br>In <i>Lim v. Antonio,</i> (125 SCRA 273 [1983]), the Court ruled that disgruntled complainants against members of the Bar may not be allowed to make use of judicial process as an instrument of retaliation.<br><br>I agree with the general rule that criminal prosecutions, civil cases, or administrative actions should not ordinarily be blocked by prohibition, injunction, or grants of motions to dismiss.&nbsp; There are, however, exceptions.<br><br>As we stated in the case of <i>Teofisto Guingona, Jr. v. City Fiscal of Manila, et al.</i> (128 SCRA 577 [1984]), exceptions may arise in the following instances:<br><blockquote>"1. for the orderly administration of justice;<br><br>2. to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner;<br><br>3. to avoid multiplicity of actions;<br><br>4. to afford adequate protection to constitutional rights;<br><br>5. in proper cases, because the statute relied upon is unconstitutional or was held invalid.&nbsp; (<i>Primicias v. Municipality of Urdaneta, Pangasinan</i>, 93 SCRA 462, 469-470 [1979]; citing <i>Ramos v. Torres</i>, 25 SCRA 557 [1968]; and <i>Hernandez v. Albano</i>, 19 SCRA 95, 96 [1967])."</blockquote>In the fairly recent case of <i>Brocka, et al. v. Juan Ponce Enrile, et al.</i> (G.R. Nos. 69863-65, December 10, 1990), this Court, through Mr. Justice Medialdea expanded the list of exceptions as follows: <blockquote> "a.&nbsp; To afford adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the accused (<i>Hernandez v. Albano, et al.</i>, L-19272, January 25, 1967, 19 SCRA 95);<br><br>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When necessary for the orderly administration of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions (<i>Dimayuga, et al. v. Fernandez</i>, 43 Phil. 304; Hernandez v. Albano, supra; Fortun v. Labang, et al. L-38383, May 27, 1981, 104 SCRA 607);<br><br>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is a pre-judicial question which is sub judice (<i>De Leon v. Mabanag</i>, 70 Phil. 202);<br><br>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the acts of the officer are without or in excess of authority (<i>Planas v. Gil</i>, 67 Phil. 62);<br><br>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or regulation (<i>Young v. Rafferty</i>, 33 Phil. 556; <i>Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad</i>, 47 Phil. 385, 389);<br><br>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When double jeopardy is clearly apparent (<i>Sangalang v. People and Alvendia</i>, 109 Phil. 1140);<br><br>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense (<i>Lopez v. City Judge</i>, L- 25795, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 616);<br><br>h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it is a case of persecution rather than prosecution (<i>Rustia v. Ocampo</i>, CA-G.R. No. 4760, March 25, 1960);<br><br>i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the charges are manifestly false and motivated by the lust for vengeance (<i>Recto v. Castelo</i>, 18 L. J. [1953], cited in <i>Ranoa v. Alvendia</i>, CA-G.R. No. 30720-R, October 8, 1962; Cf <i>Guingona, et al v. City Fiscal</i>, L-60035, April 4, 1984, 128 SCRA 577); and<br><br>j.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has been denied (<i>Salonga v. Paño, et al.</i>, L-59524, February 18, 1985, 134 SCRA 438).<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Preliminary injunction has been issued by the Supreme Court to prevent the threatened unlawful arrest of petitioners (<i>Rodriguez v. Castelo</i>, L-6374, August 1, 1953).&nbsp; (cited in Regalado, <i>Remedial Law Compendium</i>, p. 188, 1988, Ed.)"</blockquote>There were many who deplored the use of the awesome powers of government by the past dispensation to harass, intimidate, or silence critics of its acts.&nbsp; We now have a Government which takes pride in proclaiming to the whole world its adherence to principles of justice and fair play, its desire for reconciliation, and its hopes for a genuine and lasting democracy.<br><br>Unfortunately, what it says and what it does are poles apart, at least in these two cases.&nbsp; Mr. Virata and Mr. Mapa are not critics of the present Administration.&nbsp; They live quiet, dignified, and useful lives serving in the private sector.&nbsp; I can see no other reason for their vindictive inclusion in the sweeping charges of PCGG Case No. 35 except to harass and persecute them.&nbsp; I submit that it is the duty of the Court to stop these actions.<br><br>FOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, I VOTE to GRANT the petitions.</div>
