				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Here is a case of rape committed a great number of times over a
period of two (2) years by an uncle against his niece.</p>

<p class="BODY">The niece is Jho-An Cortez y Barro, an 11-year old minor when she
filed the complaint in the Regional Trial Court of Pasig while the accused
uncle is Alberto R. Barro, Jr., a full-blood brother of Jho An's mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">are </span>quoted hereunder:</p>

<blockquote>"(Jho-an Cortez) testified that
she and her sister Mary Ann, who was 9 years old at the time of the incident,
were living with their uncle and the accused herein at 223 Daang Hari St.,
Bicutan, Tagig, Metro Manila and that prior to September 21, 1987, her uncle
also used to undress her during the night and then inserted his penis in her
vagina ("pepe"); and that whenever she offered any resistance or
refusal, her uncle gets angry and would slap her and that she would cry and on
several occasions, her sister May saw and witnessed these sexual acts committed
on her person and on such occasions too, the only thing that May and she could
do, was cry.  And because of this
problem that she bore on her shoulders, she asked her friend Lilay, whose
father is one Antonio Martinez and who has a house located nearby, if she may
live with them and Antonio Martinez agreed so that sometime on September 16,
1987, she and May left the rented room of their uncle and went to live in the
house of Lilay Martinez.  But then, her
uncle traced their whereabouts and brought them back to his rented room in
Daang Hari St. and on September 21, 1987 in the evening, again her uncle undressed
her and then she was sexually ravaged.  So that thereafter, she and May again left the rented room of her uncle
and proceeded to the house of Antonio Martinez and presumably sought his
assistance such that she and her sister were brought to the Tagig Police
Station where she complained against her uncle before Pat. Felixberto Maog and
then proceeded to the Camp Crame General Hospital so that ostensibly Jho-­An
might be physically examined.  One of
the physicians in said hospital endorsed them to the PC Crime Laboratory where
Lt. Col. Desiderio Moraleda, Chief of the Medico-Legal Branch, personally
conducted an examination on the person of Jho-An Cortez (Corona) and found that
certain deep, healed lacerations in the 3 and 6 o'clock positions in the
vaginal wall of the private complainant are present indicating that an object
has deeply penetrated her vagina and caused the hymen to be broken.  In his medical report, Dr. Moraleda stated
that Jho-An Cortez is no longer a virgin and in his testimony before the Court,
he made manifest that the cause of such lacerations could have been made by a
penis inserted during sexual intercourse."</blockquote>

Plaintiff-Appellee; pp. 94-96, Rollo)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In its decision promulgated on December 7, 1988, the trial court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
found:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the accused Alberto Barro, Jr. y Relon guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of rape as charged; and therefore hereby
sentences him to life imprisonment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(<u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u>); </span>and to indemnify the complainant herein the amount of
P15,000.00." (p. 84, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused seeks the reversal of the aforesaid judgment of
conviction to one of acquittal.  He
argues that the trial court erred in giving full weight and credence to the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">in </span>disregarding the theory of the defense and that the trial
court erred in convicting him of the crime of statutory rape, because his guilt
thereof has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  (p. 50, Rollo)</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Barro maintains that complainant Jho-An is not a
reliable witness because she was born on June 24, 1973 and not on June 24, 1976
as claimed by her, implying that at the time of the incident, Jho-An was
already more than twelve (12) years old.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the aforesaid contention, the evidence of the prosecution
was the certification of the Chief of the Archives dated January 4, 1988,
showing that Jho-An was indeed born on June 24, 1976 in Catbalogan, Samar.  On the other hand, it was only the <u>uncorroborated</u>
testimony of appellant's brother, Jose Barro, who alleged that he (Jose) was
present at the time of Jho-An's birth in 1973, that was relied on by the
defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">that
Jho-An was born in 1973.  This
self-serving assertion obviously cannot prevail over the undisptued evidence of
the prosecution.  Appellant himself
confirmed the fact that Jho-An was born in 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Where the acts complained of were committed when the complainant
was still below twelve (12) years of age, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">is </span>categorized as simple rape or rapes without the attendance of
any of the qualifying circumstances mentioned in Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code, the basic element of which is the carnal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">knowledge of a woman below 12 years of
age.  Carnal knowledge of a girl under
twelve years old is always rape.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant contends that there was no spermatozoa in Jho-An's
private organ when she was examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the medical technician found no spermatozoa in the smear
taken from the cervix is immaterial in the crime of rape.  What is essential in this crime is evidence
of penetration of the offender's sex organ into the complainant's sex organ.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The trial court observed that Jho-An, during her testimony, was
articulate and intelligent for her age, displaying no hesitation but only
candor in the narration of the events constituting the crime of rape by her
uncle against her person.  In passing
upon the merits of complainant's testimonial evidence, the trial court made the
following appropriate findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Her version of what happened to her is so credible that it
made a lasting impression on the mind of the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is axiomatic that ‘when a woman testified that she had
been raped, she said all that was necessary to show that rape has been
committed'.  The complainant has
steadfastly testified before the court that she has been sexually abused by her
uncle and the accused herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Being an intelligent girl, such heinous incursions on her
person by her uncle caused heavy burden on the young shoulders such that she
considered this, according to her, a grave problem that she decided, even at
her tender age, to separate from her uncle and to flee from his rented room and
suiting her thoughts into action, she, together with her sister, did so by
going to the house of Antonio Martinez.  But then, they were found and brought back by her uncle to the same
rented room of unpleasant memories and thereat, again was sexually abused.  She could no longer take this lying down and
so sought the help of Antonio Martinez and they proceeded to the police station
to lodge her complaint.  All these steps
were taken by a minor of 11-years whose only guide was her native intelligence
and intuitive wisdom as her expression of repugnance to being sexually
assaulted by her uncle.  She sought the
help of the authorities because, as expressed by her in her testimony before
the Court, she could not show pity on her uncle because of what he did to
her." (pp. 107-109, Rollo)</blockquote>
