				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">certiorari </span>and prohibition 
with preliminary 
injunction, and the addendum thereto, petitioner seeks to enjoin the 
Sandiganbayan and the Regional Trial Courts of Manila from proceeding 
with Criminal Case No. 16698 for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, 
Section 3(e); Criminal Case No. 91-94555 for violation of Presidential 
Decree No. 46; and Criminal Case No.91-94897 for libel.
<p>
In Criminal Case No. 16698<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  filed before the Sandiganbayan, petitioner 
stands charged as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about October 17, 1988, or for sometime prior or
 
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, accused Miriam Defensor-Santiago, being then 
the Commissioner of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation, with 
evident bad faith and manifest, partiality, did then and there wilfully,
 unlawfully and criminally approve the application for legalization of 
aliens who arrived in the Philippines after January 1, 1984 in violation
 of Executive Order No. 324 dated April 13, 1988 which does not allow 
the legalization of the same, thereby causing undue injury to the 
government and giving unwarranted benefits and advantage to said aliens 
in the discharge of the official and administrative functions of said 
accused. </p>
  <p> Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Criminal Case No 91-94555<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  pending before the Regional Trial Court of Manila, petitioner, 
together with Daisy Montinola and Fermin Pacia, are accused of a 
violation of Presidential Decree No. 46 allegedly committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about November 28, 1988, or for sometime prior 
or 
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the accused Miriam Defensor-Santiago, Daisy 
Montinola and Fermin Pacia, all public officers, being then the 
Commissioner, Chief of the Board of Special Inquiry and employee of the 
Commission on Immigration and Deporta­tion, respectively, in conspiracy 
with each other, did then and there, wilfully, unlawful­ly and 
criminally solicit and receive money, gifts and other valuable things 
from several (F)ilipino and foreign businessmen the same being given by 
reason of their respective official positions for past favor and 
expected favor and better treatment in the future from said accused, in 
the discharge of their respective official functions. </p>
  <p> Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The information filed by the Office of the Special Prosecutor with the 
Regional Trial Court of Manila and docketed as Criminal Case No. 
91-94897<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  
indicts petitioner for the crime of libel, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about May 24, 1988, at the Office of the 
Commission on
 Immigration and Deportation, Port Area, Manila, Philippines, and within
 the jurisdictions of this Honorable Court, the accused, Miriam 
Defensor-Santiago, a public officer, being then the Commissioner of the 
Commission on Immigration and Deportation, acting in such capacity and 
taking advantage of her official position, did then and there with 
malice aforethought, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously call, utter, 
state, impute and make scurrilous and defamatory statements against 
Maria S. Tatoy, by portraying the latter, then Chief of the Certificate 
Section, Commission on Immigration and Deportation to be a corrupt 
employee, a perennial trouble-maker who has filed administrative cases 
against all the commissioners under whom she served and the Certificate 
Section of which she was the head as ‘not only useless but the most 
corrupt unit in the CID’, in the presence of newspaper reporters and 
media personalities, thereby finding print in the newspapers, which tend
 to cause dishonor, discredit and contempt of said Maria S. Tatoy, to 
the damage and prejudice of the latter. </p>
  <p> Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A temporary restraining order was issued by this Court on May 24, 
1991<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  ordering the Sandiganbayan and the Regional Trial Court, Branch 3, to 
respectively cease and desist from proceeding with Criminal Informations
 Nos. 11698 for violation of Republic Act No. 3019, Section 3(e) and 
91-94555 for violation of Presidential Decree No. 46. This Court, in 
issuing the said restraining order, took into consideration the fact 
that, according to petitioner, her arraignment, originally set for June 
5, 1991, was inexplicably advanced to May 27, 1991, hence the 
advisability of conserving and affording her the opportunity to avail 
herself of any remedial right to meet said contingency.
</p><p>
Petitioner avers that in filing the aforequoted criminal informations, 
respondents  Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor acted with grave abuse of 
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. Specifically, 
petitioner contends that the criminal charges are meant and intended to 
harass her as a presidential candidate, in violation of Section 10, 
Article IX-C of the Constitution which provides that "(b)ona fide 
candidates for any public office shall be free from any form of 
harassment and discrimination."
</p><p>
Petitioner likewise asserts that the Ombudsman violated the very essence
 of fair play by choosing to file the informations at a time when 
petitioner was clearly disadvantaged by the injuries which she sustained
 in a vehicular accident, and only after three (3) years from the time 
the sixteen (16) charges were initially filed in 1988 by disgruntled 
employees of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation (CID); and 
that in filing the criminal informations just a year before the 
presidential elections, respondent Ombudsman in effect wants to detain 
petitioner by reason of her political aspirations. She further submits 
that the instant petition seeks to prevent respondents Ombudsman and 
Special Prosecutor from proceeding against her in an oppressive and 
vindictive manner and to afford adequate protection to her 
constitutional rights. She consequently posits that, on the foregoing 
premises, her present recourse should be considered as an exception to 
the general prohibition against petitions of this nature in criminal 
cases.
</p><p>
In their Comment, respondents Ombudsman and Special Prosecutor refute 
the claims of petitioner, explaining in the process the sequence of 
events which led to the filing of the three (3) informations, in this 
wise:
</p><p>
"The charges involved in Criminal Case No. 16698 and Criminal Case No. 
91-94555 were taken cognizance of by the Office of the Ombudsman upon 
the same having been prominent­ly published in the January 10, 1989 
issue of the ‘Manila Standard’. The investigation was originally handled
 by then Investigator Gualberto de la Llana but, on request of the 
petitioner, was reassigned to the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for 
Luzon sometime in March, 1989. The case was handled by an investigating 
panel which submitted its draft resolution only on March 29, 1990. After
 the usual reviews by the Office of the Special Prosecutor, and of the 
Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon, the resolution was submitted 
for final action of respondent Ombudsman in late March, 1991.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A judicious appraisal of the record resulted in the 
issuance by 
the Ombudsman of the Memorandum for the Office of the Special Prosecutor
 directing the filing of the two (2) informations which have been 
docketed as Criminal Case No. 16698 of the Sandiganbayan, and Criminal 
Case No. 91-94555 of the Manila Regional Trial Court x x x. </p>
  <p> "The said Memorandum, as may be noted on the face thereof, 
is 
dated April 26, 1991, or two (2) days before petitioner met the 
vehicular accident on April 28, 1991. </p>
  <p> "Respondent Ombudsman received the informations prepared by 
the 
Office of the Special Prosecutor only on May 13, 1991. Per office 
routine, after respondent Ombudsman approved the informations, they were
 forwarded to the Office of the Special Prosecutor which filed the same 
in the appropriate courts on May 13, 1991. </p>
  <p> "The record thus attests to the fact that the filing of 
Criminal 
Cases Nos. 16698 and 91-94555 was already a settled matter as early as 
two days before petitioner’s unfortunate mishap. Their filing in court 
was in accordance with routine procedure, and impelled in some way by 
media's impatient and irritating inquiries as to what respondent 
Ombudsman had done in the petitioner's cases, induced no doubt by 
premature persistent false reports that the cases against petitioner had
 been dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman. </p>
  <p> "With respect to the libel case which was filed with the 
Manila 
Regional Trial Court on May 24, 1991, docketed therein as Criminal Case 
No. 91-94897, the record will also show that the information in this 
case could have been filed as early as October 12, 1990 when the 
resolution recommending the prosecution of petitioner for libel was 
approved by respondent Ombudsman. x x x How­ever, on the day it was to 
be filed, some lawyers of the petitioner came and asked the respondent 
Ombudsman to defer the filing of the information inasmuch as they intend
 to file a motion for reinvestigation, which they did on October 29, 
1990. The reinvestigation was denied in a Memorandum dated 25 March 1991
 of Special Prosecution Officer Reynaldo L. Mendoza (approved by 
respondent Ombudsman on April 22, 1991) and an information was 
subsequently filed on May 24, 1991. </p>
  <p> "Like in the previous two (2) cases, the filing of Criminal 
Case 
No. 91-94897 for libel had no relation at all to the accident which 
befell the petitioner on April 28, 1991. Its filing after that accident 
was caused by a clearly delaying tactic on the part of the petitioner. 
It is rather unkind for petitioner to impute ill-motivation on the part 
of the respondents for something she herself is to blame."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court accordingly also takes note of the aforesaid disclosures of 
respondent Ombudsman that it was petitioner, personally or through 
counsel, who made representations with said respondent which he granted 
and caused him to defer action for some time on the complaints which 
were ultimately filed against her.
</p><p>
It is a long-standing doctrine that writs of injunction or prohibition 
will not lie to restrain a criminal prosecution for the reason that 
public interest requires that criminal acts be immediately investigated 
and prosecuted for the protection of society, except in specified cases 
among which are to prevent the use of the strong arm of the law in an 
oppressive and vindictive manner, and to afford adequate protection to 
constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
The rule is equally applicable in cases where the Ombudsman had 
authorized the Special Prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation
 or to file an information as in the case at bar. Indubitably, such a 
responsible official is vested with discretion and is endowed with the 
competence to determine whether the complaint filed is sufficient in 
form and substance to merit such referral. The Ombudsman may himself 
dismiss the complaint in the first instance if in his judgment the acts 
or omissions complained of are not illegal, unjust, improper or 
sufficient. The Special Prosecutor, in case of referral of the 
complaint, may also dismiss the same on proper grounds after the 
requisite investigative and adjudicatory proceedings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  But if, as emphasized by respondent Ombudsman, "the evidence presented
 during the preliminary investigation constitute very valid grounds to 
charge petitioner Santiago and her co-accused before the Sandiganbayan 
and the Regional Trial Courts of Manila," no compelling reason would 
exist for us to rule otherwise.
</p><p>
Petitioner, claiming exception to the interdiction against a suit to 
enjoin criminal prosecution, avers that the instant petition seeks to 
prevent the strong arm of the law from being utilized in an oppressive 
and vindictive manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  She
 then postulates that as one who has consistently topped all major 
presidential surveys from 1990 to 1991, the filing of the information’s 
against her will prejudice her standing in the presidential surveys. 
This is, contextually and for legal intents and purposes herein, a mere 
verisimilitude.
</p><p>
At any rate, we definitely cannot subordinate the demands of public 
interest and policy to the political aspirations of herein petitioner. 
We have carefully gone over the records of the case and, contrary to the
 pretensions of petitioner, there is nothing to show that the 
informations in question were filed with the vindictive intention to 
oppress, harass and discriminate against her or to violate her 
constitutional rights. It is significant that petitioner failed to 
impute, much less prove, any ill-motive on the part of herein public 
respondents. Respondent Ombudsman categorically states that, and 
convincingly explains why, he "has no purpose, motive nor desire to 
endanger or discredit petitioner's aspirations for the highest position 
in the land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  
This is made no more apparent than in the various memoranda<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  approved by respondent Ombudsman establishing that the admitted facts 
of record are sufficient to engender a well founded belief that each of 
the crimes charged has been committed, which parenthetically, is the 
requisite quantum of evidence at this posture of each of said cases.
</p><p>
Petitioner submits that she cannot be held liable as charged and raises 
the following defenses: that the donations received were not for 
personal use but were distributed to the CID employees in a raffle held 
during the CID Christmas party; that the legalization of aliens who 
arrived the Philippines after January 1, 1984 was in accordance with the
 authority vested in her by Executive Order No. 324 and was intended to 
assure family unity; and that the defamatory words were made against 
Maria Tatoy only in self-defense.
</p><p>
We are not persuaded that we should, in the present recourse, pass upon 
these asseverations of petitioner which we note have previously been 
raised during the preliminary investigation. She will of course, have 
all the opportunity to ventilate and substantiate the same in the 
proceedings before and/or during the trial of these cases in the lower 
courts which would be the proper stages and fora for the adjudication 
thereof. Accordingly, we quote with approval this portion of the Comment
 of respondent Ombudsman:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In her Petition and in the Addendum hereto, the petitioner 
had 
not made any denial of the operative facts on the basis of which the 
charges have been filed. Instead, petitioner relies on her perceived 
defenses on her interpretation of the said acts and the laws applicable 
thereto. </p>
  <p> "Thus, in Criminal Case No. 91-94555 for a violation of P.D.
 46, 
petitioner admits the solicitation of donations and the giving of the 
same by those from whom such donations were solicited. Petitioner 
justifies the said act by claiming that the donations were not given for
 her ‘personal use’ but for the purpose of the Christmas party of the 
Commission on Immigration and Deportation. Whether this claim would 
negate the applicability of P.D. 46 would involve an inquiry into 
certain facts which could only be ascertained during the trial of the 
case. Significantly, petitioner had not denied that the solicitation of 
said gifts was at her instance, and that she even scolded a certain 
Renato Orlanda whom she requested to sign the solicitation letters, but 
who refused to do so for fear of committing a violation of the law 
punishing such act. </p>
  <p> "With respect to Criminal Case No. 16698 for a violation of 
Sec. 
3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, petitioner has also not denied that she admitted 
and approved the legalization of aliens who arrived in the Philippines 
after January 1, 1984, which act is contrary to the express provision of
 Executive Order No. 324. She reasons out her doing so by putting forth 
certain alleged principles and provisions of the same Executive Order 
which could be interpreted as giving her such authority to disregard the
 express prohibition in Executive Order No. 324. Again, these are 
matters of defense which the petitioner should prove during the trial. 
</p>
  <p> "In the libel case (Criminal Case No. 91-94897), petitioner 
likewise admits having uttered the words constituting the bases thereof 
in a television interview. She does not deny its libelous nature. She 
claims justification for having uttered the defamatory words against 
complainant Maria Tatoy on the ground of self-defense. Allegedly, Tatoy 
in an earlier interview, had mentioned about desiring to form a labor 
union among the employees of CID, but that the petitioner was against 
such move. Respondents fail to see how said statement of Tatoy could be 
considered as defamatory to justify a libelous response thereto on the 
ground of self-defense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>

    <p><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
  </strong></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>FELICIANO, J.:
  </strong>
</p><p>
It is with regret that I am unable to agree completely with the majority
 opinion written by my learned brother in the Court, Mr. Justice 
Regalado, with his customary lucidity. That opinion expresses clearly 
the ordinary rule in the following terms:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is a along-standing doctrine that writs of injunction or
 
prohibition will not lie to restrain a criminal prosecution for the 
reason that public interest requires that criminal acts be immediately 
investigated and prosecuted for the protection of society, except in 
specified cases among which are to prevent the use of the strong arm of 
the law in an oppressive and vindictive manner, and to afford adequate 
protection to constitutionals rights." (Citation omitted) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Justice Regalado also points out that the above general rule is 
applicable in respect of criminal prosecutions commenced by the Special 
Prosecutor and the Ombudsman:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The rule is of equal application in cases where the 
Ombudsman had
 authorized the Special Prosecutor to conduct a preliminary 
investigation or to file an information as in the case at bar. 
Indubitably,, such a responsible official is vested with discretion and 
is endowed with the competence to determine whether the complaint filed 
is sufficient in form and substance to merit such referral. The 
Ombudsman may himself dismiss the complaint in the first instance if in 
his judgment the acts or omissions complained of are not illegal, 
unjust, improper or sufficient. The Special Prosecutor, in case of 
referral of the complaint, may also dismiss the same on proper grounds 
after the requisite investigative and adjudicatory proceedings. x x x." 
(Citation omitted) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is clear, of course, that there are more than a few exceptions to the
 above general rule. In Brocka, et al. v. Ponce-Enrile, et al.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Medialdea, included the 
following in a list which would appear to be an open-ended one:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “a. To afford adequate protection to the constitutional 
rights of 
the accused (Hernandez v. Albano, et al., L-19272, January 25, 1967, 19 
SCRA 95); </p>
  <p>
  b. When necessary for the orderly administration of justice or x x x 
[to prevent] multiciplity of actions (Dimayuga, et al. v. Fernandez. 43 
Phil. 304; Hernandez v. Albano, supra; Fortun v. Labang, et al., 
L-38383, May 27, 1981, 104 SCRA 607);
  </p>
  <p>
  c. When there is a pre-judicial question which is sub judice, (De Leon
 v. Mabanag, 70 Phil. 202);
  </p>
  <p>
  x x x                                                          x x x  
                                                           x x x
  </p>
  <p>
  e. Where the prosecution is under an invalid law, ordinance or 
regulation (Young v. Rafferty, 33 Phil. 556: Yu Cong Eng v. Trinidad, 47
 Phil. 385, 389);
  </p>
  <p>
  f. When double jeopardy is clearly apparent (Sangalang v. People and 
Alvendia, 109 Phil. 1140);
  </p>
  <p>
  g. Where the court has no jurisdiction over the offense (Lopez v. City
 Judge, L-25795, October 29, 1966, 18 SCRA 616);
  </p>
  <p>
  x x x                                                          x x x  
                                                           x x x
  </p>
  <p>
  j. When there is clearly no prima facie case against the accused and a
 motion to quash on that ground has been denied (Salonga v. Pano, et 
al., L-59524, February 18, 1985, 134 SCRA 438);
  </p>
  <p> x x x                                                       
   x x
 x                                                             x x x”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is my respectful submission that if the instant case, to the extent 
discussed below, does not already fall within one of the above 
exceptions, another and separate exception ought to be recognized.
</p><p>
The information filed before the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 
16698 charges the petitioner as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about October 17, 1988, or for sometime prior or
 
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, accused Miriam Defensor-Santiago, being then 
the Commissioner of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation, with 
evident bad faith and manifest partiality, did then and there willfully,
 unlawfully and criminally approve the application for legalization of 
aliens who arrived in the Philippines after January 1, 1984 in violation
 of Executive Order No. 324 dated April 13, 1988 which does not allow 
the legalization of the same, thereby causing undue injury to the 
government and giving unwarranted benefits and advantage to the said 
aliens in the discharge of the official and administrative functions of 
said accused. </p>
  <p> Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Essentially, the above information charges that petitioner had, in 
violation of the provisions of Executive Order No. 324 approved 
applications for legalization of the stay of aliens who had arrived in 
the Philippines after January 1, 1984. The information takes the 
position that Executive Order “does not allow the legalization of the 
same.”
</p><p>
Executive Order No. 324 entitled “Waiving Passport Requirements for 
Immigrants under Certain Conditions,” dated April 13, 1988, was 
promulgated pursuant to Section 47 (A) (3) of C.A. No. 613 as amended, 
the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, which provides that
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, the President 
is authorized: </p>
  <p>
    (a) when the public interest so warrants:

  <p> (3) to waive the passport requirements for immigrants, under
 such conditions as he may prescribe."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Executive Order No. 324 provides that an alien may apply with the 
Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation for waiver of passport 
requirements during a 12-month period beginning on a date to be 
designated by the Commissioner. The Order provides, among other things, 
that the alien "must establish that he entered the Philippines before 
January 1, 1984 and that he has resided continuously in the Philippines 
in an unlawful status from such date to the filing of his application."
</p><p>
Petitioner is charged with having unlawfully waived the passport 
requirements of certain aliens who arrived after January 1, 1984. It is 
clear from the record of this case, especially of the preliminary 
investigation conducted by the Office of the Special Prosecutor, that 
petitioner herself stated that she had allowed aliens who had arrived in
 the Philippines after January 1, 1984, but who were the spouses or 
minor children of qualified aliens -- the latter being alien spouses or 
parents who had entered the Philippines before January 1, 1984 and who 
were themselves qualified for waiver of passport requirements under 
Executive Order No. 324 -- to apply for waiver of passport requirements 
and, after compliance with requirements of Executive Order No. 324, 
approved such "legalization."
</p><p>
Executive Order No. 324 is not itself a statute prescribing penal 
sanctions for certain acts. Thus, disregard of Executive Order No. 324 
would not, by itself, give rise to criminal liability. The criminal 
information in this case in effect links up Executive Order No. 324 with
 Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019, known as the Anti-Graft and 
Corrupt Practices Act. Section 3 (e) of the Anti-Graft Act reads as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 3. Corrupt Practices of such Officers. -- In addition 
to 
acts or omissions of such officers already penalized by existing law, 
the following constitute corrupt practices of any public officer and 
hereby declared to be unlawful: </p>
  <p>
    x x x                                                          x x x
                                                             x x x
  </p>
  <p> (e) causing any undue injury to any party, including the 
Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, 
advantage or preference in the discharge of his official, administrative
 or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or
 gross inexcusable negligence. This provision shall apply to officers 
and employees of offices or government corporations charged with the 
grant of licenses or permits or other concessions." (Underscoring 
supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It must be noted, firstly, that petitioner, as the then Commissioner of 
Immigration and Deportation, was expressly authorized and obliged by 
Executive Order No. 324 to apply and administer and enforce its 
provisions. Indeed, petitioner was authorized to issue rules and 
regulations to implement that Executive Order (paragraph 16). Secondly, 
the application and administration of Executive Order No. 324 involve, 
not ministerial or mechanical acts, but rather the exercise of judgment 
and discretion, adjudicatory and hence quasi-judicial in nature. 
Thirdly, and perhaps most notably, paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Executive
 Order provide as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "11. Except as provided in Paragraph 12, herein, the 
Commissioner 
of Immigration and Deportation may waive exclusion grounds under the 
Immigration Act in the case of individual aliens for humanitarian 
purposes to assure family unity or for the public interest. </p>
  <p>
    12. The following grounds for exclusion may not be waived by the 
Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation, namely, (a) those relating 
to criminals; (b) those relating to aliens likely to become public 
charges; (c) those relating to drug offenses, except for so much of 
those provisions as relates to a single offense of simple possession of 
marijuana; and (d) those relating to national security and members of 
subversive organization.
  </p>
  <p> x x x                                                       
      
 x x x                                                                x x
 x"
  </p>
  <p>
  (Underscoring supplied)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Paragraph 11, it will be seen, expressly authorizes petitioner to waive 
grounds for exclusion of aliens under the Immigration Act in two (2) 
cases: (a) "for humanitarian purposes to assure family unity;" and (b) 
"for the public interest." Under Section 29 (a) of the Philippine 
Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, the classes of aliens excluded from
 entry into the Philippines include:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “(17) Persons not properly documented for admission as may 
be required under the provisions of this Act.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon the other hand, paragraph 12 specifies the categories of persons in
 whose cases no waiver of grounds of exclusion may be granted.
</p><p>
It will be seen then that the acts of petitioner, which the information 
assumes to be criminal in nature, constituted official acts of 
petitioner done in the course of applying, interpreting and construing 
Executive Order No. 324. There is no question that the applications for 
waiver of passport requirements by the spouses and minor children of 
qualified aliens were admitted and approved by petitioner "for 
humanitarian purposes to assure family unity." It is also not disputed 
that the said alien spouses and minor children did not fall under any of
 the (non--waivable) excluded classes listed in paragraph 12 of 
Executive Order No. 324. It is similarly undisputed that no one has 
pretended that petitioner had any personal or corrupt interest in any of
 the cases of alien spouses and minor children of qualified aliens she 
had acted upon. No one has suggested, for instance, that the fees 
specified in paragraph 9 of Executive Order No. 324 either were not 
collected by the Government or were misappropriated by petitioner and 
converted to her own use. It may be noted, incidentally, that paragraph 9
 expressly authorizes the Commissioner "in her discretion, [to] charge a
 lower fee for the spouses and minor children below 21 years old of the 
applicant." The criminal information, as noted above, included an 
allegation of "evident bad faith and manifest partiality." It is clear, 
however, that the facts brought out in the prelimi­nary investigation 
offered absolutely no basis for such an allegation which is actually a 
conclusion offered by the Special Prosecutor, much like the words 
"wilfully, unlaw­fully and criminally" which are recited redundantly in 
the criminal information here. Again, the facts disclosed in the 
preliminary investigation showed no "undue injury," to the Government 
and no "unwarranted benefit or advantage" to the alien wives and minor 
children of qualified aliens outside of the simple acceptance and 
approval of the applications for waiver of passport requirements (so 
called "legalization") by petitioner. In other words, if the 
interpretation or construction given by petitioner to Executive Order 
No. 324 is correct -- i.e., that applica­tions for waiver of passport 
requirements by alien wives and minor children, arriving after January 
1, 1984, of qualified aliens who had themselves arrived in the 
Philippines before January 1, 1984 and who were otherwise eligible under
 the terms and conditions of Executive Order No. 324 may be granted for 
humanitarian purposes in the interest of allowing or restoring family 
unity -- there would be no "injury," let alone an "undue injury," to the
 Government. Neither can the benefit of waiver of passport requirements 
in the cases of such spouses and minor children of qualified aliens be 
deemed to be an "unwarranted" benefit to such aliens if petitioner's 
interpretation of Executive Order No. 324 be held to be correct.
</p><p>
It is a rule too firmly established to require documentation that 
contemporaneous interpretations of a statute or implementing regulation 
by the executive or administrative officials precisely charged with the 
implementation of such a statute or regulation are entitled to great 
weight and respect from the courts. This Court itself has in many 
instances deferred to such interpret­ations rendered by such 
administrative officers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  
But even if an administrative interpretation be ultimately found to be 
incorrect as a matter of law by this Court, the official responsible for
 such interpretation is not, for that reason alone, to be held liable 
personally, whether civilly or criminally or administratively. It is 
just as firmly settled that to impose liability upon the public officer 
who has so acted, something far graver than error of law or error of 
judgment must be clearly shown and that is corrupt personal intentions, 
personal malice or bad faith.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  As noted above, no such allegations were made 
during the preliminary investigation in Criminal Case No. 16698.
</p><p>
My submission, with respect, is that whether the acts admittedly done by
 petitioner were criminal in nature, is a legal question, on which 
petitioner in effect asks us to rule in this Petition. I believe, 
further, that there is nothing to prevent this Court from addressing and
 ruling on this legal issue. There is no real need for proof of any 
additional essential facts apart from those already admitted by 
petitioner. It seems to me that a public officer is entitled to have 
legal questions like that before this Court resolved at the earliest 
possible opportunity, that a public officer should not be compelled to 
go through the aggravation, humiliation and expense of the whole process
 of criminal trial, if the legal characterization of the acts charged as
 criminal is the very issue at stake.
</p><p>
I respectfully submit, still further, that the acts charged do not, as a
 matter of law, constitute a crime. Indeed, if the acts which petitioner
 admits having done constitute a criminal offense, very serious 
consequences would follow for the administration of law and government 
rules and regulations in general. For the thrust of the criminal 
information here would appear to be that public officers interpret and 
apply statutory and regulatory provisions at their own peril and at the 
risk of criminal liability, notwithstanding the absence of any corrupt 
intent to profit personally by any such interpretation and application.
</p><p>
The second information was filed in Criminal Case No. 91-94555 before 
the Regional Trial Court of Manila, charging petitioner with Daisy 
Montinola and Fermin Pacia with violation of P.D. No. 46 allegedly 
committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about November 28, 1988, or for sometime prior 
or 
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the accused Miriam Defenssor-Santiago, Daisy 
Montinola and Fermin Pacia, all Public officers, being then the 
Commissioner, Chief of the Board of Special Inquiry and employee of the 
Commission on Immigration and Deportation, respectively, in conspiracy 
with each other, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and criminally
 solicit and receive money, gifts and other valuable things from several
 (F)ilipino and foreign businessmen the same being given by reason of 
their respective official positions for past favor and expected favor 
and better treatment in the future from said accused, in the discharge 
of their respective official functions. </p>
  <p> Contrary to law."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The facts brought out during the preliminary investigation of the above 
charge showed that, in connection with a Christmas party held on 20 
December 1988 at 3:30 p.m. in front of the CID building, held by the 
Commission on Immigration and Deportation for the benefit of its 
employees, letters of solicitation were sent out to a great many people 
and companies, under the signature of Daisy Montinola and Fermin Pacia 
who were Chairman of the Christmas Committee and President of the CID 
Employees Association, respectively. The identical letters of 
solicitation read as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Dear xxx: </p>
  <p>
    The CID Christmas Party for employees will be held on Tuesday, 20 
December 1988 at 3:30 p.m., in front of the CID Building on Magallanes 
Drive, Intramuros.
  </p>
  <p>
    We shall be happy to receive your donations for the CID, to be 
distributed to the employees during the party. Further, we wish to 
invite you to the party, so that you can witness the distribution of 
proposed Christmas bags.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Under P.D. Nos. 46 and 807, the Commissioner strictly prohibits any 
employee from receiving any Christmas gift. Hence, Christmas gifts may 
be given, only to the CID as an agency.
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Thank you very much for your generosity, and please accept 
our best Christmas wishes. xxx"
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Three hundred twenty-six (326) letters were sent out; one hundred one 
(101) addressees responded with donations. Petitioner submitted a list 
of the donors and of the items and cash donated to the CID. The cash 
donations were used to purchase food and grocery items which, together 
with donations consisting of food, were then divided and packaged as 
individual Christmas baskets and distributed to 700 officers and 
employees of the CID, plus 34 members of the CID security force. 
Donations in kind, including five (5) electric appliances, plus small 
consolation prizes, were raffled off to the employees during the 
Christmas party. Petitioner also furnished a list of these prizes and of
 the CID employees who won them, as well as an accounting of the 
purchases of food and grocery items. The accounting showed that a 
balance of P8,568.75 remained, which balance was earmarked to assist in 
the funding of the CID summer excursion for CID employees and their 
families.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
The operative portion of P.D. No. 46, dated 10 November 1972, reads as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>"NOW, THEREFORE, I, FERDINAND E. 
MARCOS,</strong> President 
of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the 
Constitution as Commander-in-Chief of all the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines, and pursuant to Proclamation No. 1081 dated September 21, 
1972, and General Order No. 1 dated September 22, 1972, do hereby make 
it punishable for any public official or employee, whether of the 
national or local governments, to receive, directly or indirectly, and 
for private persons to give, or offer to give, any gift, present or 
other valuable thing on any occasion, including Christmas, when such 
gift, present or other valuable thing is given by reason of his official
 position, regardless of whether or not the same is for past favor or 
favors or the giver hopes or expects to receive a favor or better 
treatment in the future from the public official or employee concerned 
in the discharge of his official functions. Included within the 
prohibition is the throwing of parties or entertainments in honor of the
 official or employee or his immediate relatives.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For violation of this Decree, the penalty of imprisonment for not less 
than one (1) year nor more than five (5) years and perpetual 
disqualification from public office shall be imposed. The official or 
employee concerned shall likewise be subject to administrative 
disciplinary action and, if found guilty, shall be meted out the penalty
 of suspension or removal, depending on the seriousness of the offense."
 (Underscoring supplied)
</p><p>
Here again, I respectfully submit, a serious legal question exists: 
whether or not the above acts of petitioner, as admitted by her during 
the course of the preliminary investigation, fall within the scope of 
P.D. No. 46. It is not disputed that the solicitation had been made for 
the purpose stated in the solicitation letter itself -- the 1988 
Christmas party of the CID officers and employees. It is also not 
disputed that all the donations in cash or in kind had been utilized for
 and in connection with such Christmas party, and that the only personal
 benefit received by petitioner and her two (2) co-accused consisted of 
one Christmas food basket each, along with more than 700 other officers 
and employees of the CID.
</p><p>
One may, of course, debate the wisdom of the measures so adopted or 
tolerated by petitioner in connection with that 1988 CID Christmas 
party. Petitioner hardly invented the employees’ Christmas party, a 
practice widely observed in both the public and the private sectors. 
Petitioner's special contribution consisted of making sure that the 
solicitation, receipt and distribution of gifts were all done in an 
organized and public manner, in full view of all the officers and 
employees of the CID and of the general public, doubtless to emphasize 
for whose benefit such solicitation had been conducted, to minimize 
private or secret solicitation by individual CID officers or employees, 
and to preclude any charge of secret personal benefit on her part and of
 those who signed the solicitation letters. What is at stake here, 
however, is the legal question of whether or not the acts which 
petitioner has admitted constitute a criminal offense under P.D. No. 46 
which, I believe, is ripe for determination by this Court. I also submit
 that those acts do not fall within the scope of P.D. No. 46 as it is 
presently written.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  It may 
well be that, as a matter of administrative policy, all solicitation 
including solicitation for the benefit of the officers and employees of a
 particular agency of government should be prohibited and perhaps 
criminalized. That, however, is something for the legislative authority 
to consider and act upon, not the courts and certainly not in a criminal
 case.
</p>
For all the foregoing, and certainly in respect of two (2) out of the 
three (3) criminal informations filed against petitioner, I believe that
 the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition should be granted and vote 
accordingly.

  <p><strong>SEPARATE OPINION
  </strong></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:
  </strong>
</p><p>The long-standing doctrine is, indeed, that Writs of 
Injunction 
or Prohibition do not lie to restrain a criminal prosecution in view of 
the public interest involved. In fact, petitioner concedes this point 
but seeks an exception in her case.
</p><p>
I just wish to emphasize that the dismissal of this Petition in no way 
reflects on the criminal liability of petitioner. Its immediate effect 
is only that the cases against her may now proceed but without prejudice
 to procedural remedies that are open to her, like a Motion to Quash, 
and the defenses that she may raise, among them being, in at least two 
of the three cases, that the acts charged, as a matter of law, do not 
constitute an offense but are, as stated in Justice Feliciano's dissent,
 a matter of administrative interpretation or policy for which a public 
official should not be subjected to civil or criminal liability.
</p><p>
I would also like to point out that the Commissioner of Immigration and 
Deportation is charged with the administration of immigration laws. 
Section 3 of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 (C.A. No. 613) 
provides that the Commissioner "shall issue from time to time such 
instructions, not inconsistent with law, as he shall deem best 
calculated to carry out the provisions of the immigration laws." 
Executive Order No. 324, likewise, explicitly authorizes the 
Commissioner to issue rules and regulations necessary to implement the 
said Executive Order (paragraph 16). The Commissioner may even waive 
exclusion grounds under the Immigration Act, save in cases otherwise 
provided by law (paragraph 11).
</p><p>
In a pending bill in Congress (H. No. 30878), or the "Alien Legalization
 Act of 1991," the stay in the country of aliens who entered the 
Philippines prior to 2 February 1987 may be legalized upon their 
application (Sec. 2), which could mean any time prior thereto or even 
after January 1, 1984. The Commissioner is likewise given the authority 
to determine who among the alien-applicants may be qualified to be 
permanent residents, any adverse decision made being appealable only to 
the Office of the President (Sec. 7).
</p><p>
Indeed, inherent in the Commissioner's function is the exercise of 
judgment and discretion in the application of the laws that said 
official has been authorized to administer and enforce. The 
interpretation given by that Office, as with all other administrative 
bodies, is, as a general rule, entitled to great weight and respect.
