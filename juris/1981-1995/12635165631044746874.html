Nos. 106984-85, is a Philippine corporation registered with the Board of Investments ("BOI") as a preferred pioneer enterprise with respect to its integrated pulp and paper mill, and as a preferred non?pioneer enterprise with respect to its integrated plywood and veneer mills.<br><br>On 21 April 1983, Picop received from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ("CIR") two (2) letters of assessment and demand both dated 31 March 1983:&nbsp; (a) one for deficiency transaction tax and for documentary and science stamp tax; and (b) the other for deficiency income tax for 1977, for an aggregate

26 April 1983, Picop protested the assessment of deficiency transaction tax and documentary and science stamp taxes. Picop also protested on 21 May 1983 the deficiency income tax assessment for 1977.&nbsp; These protests were not formally acted upon by respondent CIR. On 26 September 1984, the CIR issued a warrant of distraint on personal property and a warrant of levy on real property against Picop, to enforce collection of the contested assessments; in effect, the CIR denied Picop's protests.<br><br>Thereupon, Picop went before the Court of Tax Appeals ("CTA") appealing the assessments. After trial, the CTA rendered a decision dated 15 August 1989, modifying the findings of the CIR and holding Picop liable for the reduced aggregate amount of P20,133,762.33, which was itemized in the dispositive portion of the decision as follows:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td width="66%">"35% Transaction Tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </td> <td valign="BOTTOM" width="34%"><div align="RIGHT">P16,020,113.20</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT">Documentary &amp; Science</div></td> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT">Stamp Tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </div></td> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT">300,300.00</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT">Deficiency Income Tax Due . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT">3,813,349.33</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="BOTTOM"><div align="LEFT">TOTAL AMOUNT DUE AND PAYABLE . . . . . . . </div></td> <td style="text-decoration: underline;" valign="BOTTOM"><div align="RIGHT">P20,133,762.53"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table> </blockquote><br>Picop and the CIR both went to the Supreme Court on separate Petitions for Review of the above decision of the CTA.&nbsp; In two (2) Resolutions dated 7 February 1990 and 19 February 1990, respectively, the Court referred the two (2) Petitions to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals consolidated the two (2) cases and rendered a decision, dated 31 August 1992, which further reduced the liability of Picop to P6,338,354.70.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the Court of Appeals decision reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appeal of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is denied for lack of merit.&nbsp; The judgment against PICOP is modified, as follows:<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PICOP is declared liable for the 35% transaction tax in the amount of P3,578,543.51;<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PICOP is absolved from the payment of documentary and science stamp tax of P300,000.00 and the compromise penalty of P300.00;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PICOP shall pay 20% interest per annum on the deficiency income tax of P1,481,579.15, for a period of three (3) years from 21 May 1983, or in the total amount of P888,947.49, and a surcharge of 10% on the latter amount, or P88,984.75.<br><br>No pronouncement as to costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."</blockquote><br>Picop and the CIR once more filed separate Petitions for Review before the Supreme Court.&nbsp; These cases were consolidated and, on 23 August 1993, the Court resolved to give due course to both Petitions in G.R. Nos. 106949-50 and 106984-85 and required the parties to file their Memoranda.<br><br>Picop now maintains that it is not liable at all to pay any of the assessments or any part thereof.&nbsp; It assails the propriety of the thirty-five percent (35%) deficiency transaction tax which the Court of Appeals held due from it in the amount of P3,578,543.51.&nbsp; Picop also questions the imposition by the Court of Appeals of the deficiency income tax of P1,481,579.15, resulting from disallowance of certain claimed financial guarantee expenses and claimed year-end adjustments of sales and cost of sales figures by Picop's external auditors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The CIR, upon the other hand, insists that the Court of Appeals erred in finding Picop not liable for surcharge and interest on unpaid transaction tax and for documentary and science stamp taxes and in allowing Picop to claim as deductible expenses:<br><br><blockquote>(a)&nbsp; the net operating losses of another corporation (i.e., Rustan Pulp and Paper Mills, Inc.); and<br><br>(b)&nbsp; interest payments on loans for the purchase of machinery and equipment.</blockquote><br>The CIR also claims that Picop should be held liable for interest at fourteen percent (14%) per annum from 15 April 1978 for three (3) years, and interest at twenty percent (20%) per annum for a maximum of three (3) years; and for a surcharge of ten percent (10%), on Picop's deficiency income tax.&nbsp; Finally, the CIR contends that Picop is liable for the corporate development tax equivalent to five percent (5%) of its correct 1977 net income.<br><br>The issues which we must here address may be sorted out and grouped in the following manner:<br><br><ol type="I"><li>Whether Picop is liable for:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

These promissory notes were purchased by various commercial banks and financial institutions.&nbsp; On these promissory notes, Picop paid interest in the aggregate amount of P45,771,849.00.&nbsp; In respect of these interest payments, the CIR required Picop to pay the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax.<br><br>The CIR based this assessment on Presidential Decree No. 1154 dated 3 June 1977, which reads in part as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"Section 1.&nbsp; The National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, is hereby further amended by adding a new section thereto to read as follows:<br><br>'Sec. 195-C.&nbsp; <i>Tax on certain interest</i>. â There <i>shall be</i> levied, assessed, collected and paid <i>on every commercial paper issued in the primary market as principal instrument, a transaction tax equivalent to thirty-five percent (35%) based on the gross amount of interest thereto as defined hereunder, which shall be paid by the borrower/issuer: Provided, however</i>, that in the case of a long-term commercial paper whose maturity exceeds more than one year, the borrower shall pay the tax based on the amount of interest corresponding to one year, and thereafter shall pay the tax upon accrual or actual payment (whichever is earlier) of the untaxed portion of the interest which corresponds to a period not exceeding one year.<br><br>The transaction tax imposed in this section shall<i> be a final tax to be paid by the borrower</i> and shall be allowed as a deductible item for purposes of computing the borrower's taxable income.<br><br>For purposes of this tax&nbsp;

Interest shall be deemed synonymous with discount and shall include all fees, commissions, premiums and other payments which form integral parts of the charges imposed as a consequence of the use of money.<br><br>In all cases, where no interest rate is stated or if the rate stated is lower than the prevailing interest rate at the time of the issuance or renewal of commercial paper, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, upon consultation with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of the Philippines, shall adjust the interest rate in accordance herewith, and assess the tax on the basis thereof.<br><br><i>The tax herein imposed shall be remitted by the borrower to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or his Collection Agent</i> in the municipality where such borrower has its principal place of business within five (5) working days from the issuance of the commercial paper.&nbsp;

No. 137, as amended, which granted new mines and old mines resuming operation "five (5) years complete tax exemptions, except income tax, from the time of its actual bonafide orders for equipment for commercial production." In denying the claim for refund, this Court held:<br><br><blockquote>"The petitioner's contentions deserve scant consideration.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The 35% transaction tax is imposed on interest income from commercial papers issued in the primary money market. Being a tax on interest, it is a tax on income.</span><br><br>As correctly ruled by the respondent Court of Tax Appeals:<br><blockquote>'Accordingly, we need not and do not think it necessary to discuss 
further the nature of the transaction tax more than to say that the incipient scheme in the issuance of Letter of Instructions No. 340 on November 24, 1975 (O.G. Dec. 15, 1975), i.e., to achieve operational simplicity and effective administration in capturing the interest-income "windfall" from money market operations as a new source of revenue, has lost none of its animating principle in parturition of amendatory Presidential Decree No. 1154, now Section 210 (b) of the Tax Code. <span style="font-style: italic;">The tax thus imposed is actually a tax on interest earnings of the lenders or placers who are actually the taxpayers in whose income is imposed</span>.&nbsp; Thus "the borrower withholds the tax of 35% from the interest he would have to pay the lender so that he (borrower) can pay the 35% of the interest to the Government."

No. 5186, as amended.&nbsp; Picop was the withholding agent, obliged to withhold thirty-five percent (35%) of the interest payable to its lenders and to remit the amounts so withheld to the Bureau of Internal Revenue ("BIR").&nbsp; As a withholding agent, Picop is made <i>personally liable</i> for the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and if it did not actually withhold thirty-five percent (35%) of the interest monies it had paid to its lenders, Picop had only itself to blame.<br><br>Picop claims that it had relied on a ruling, dated 6 October 1977, issued by the CIR, which held that Picop was not liable for the thirty-five (35%) transaction tax in respect of debenture bonds issued by Picop.&nbsp; Prior to the issuance of the promissory notes involved in the instant case, Picop had also issued debenture bonds P100,000,000.00 in aggregate face value.&nbsp; The managing underwriter of this debenture bond issue, Bancom Development Corporation, requested a formal ruling from the Bureau of Internal Revenue on the liability of Picop for the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax in respect of such bonds.&nbsp; The ruling rendered by the then Acting Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Efren I. Plana, stated in relevant part:<br><br><blockquote>"It is represented that PICOP will be offering to the public primary bonds in the aggregate principal sum of one hundred million pesos (P100,000,000.00); that the bonds will be issued as debentures in denominations of one thousand pesos (P1,000.00) or multiples, <span style="font-style: italic;">to mature in ten (10) years</span> at 14% interest per annum payable semi-annually; that t<span style="font-style: italic;">he bonds are convertible into common stock of the issuer</span> at the option of the bond holder at an agreed conversion price; that the issue will be covered by a 'Trust Indenture' with a duly authorized trust corporation as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which trustee will act for and in behalf of the debenture bond holders as beneficiaries; that once issued, <span style="font-style: italic;">the bonds cannot be preterminated by the holder and cannot be redeemed by the issuer until after eight (8) years from date of issue; that the debenture bonds will be subordinated to present and future debts of PICOP;</span> and that said bonds are intended to be listed in the stock exchanges, which will place them alongside listed equity issues.<br><br>In reply, I have the honor to inform you that although the bonds hereinabove described are commercial papers which will be issued in the primary market, however, i<span style="font-style: italic;">t is clear from the abovestated facts that said bonds will not be issued as money market instruments.</span> Such being the case, and considering that the purposes of Presidential Decree No. 1154, as can be gleaned from Letter of Instruction No. 340, dated November 21, 1975, are (a) to regulate money market transactions and (b) to ensure the collection of the tax on interest derived from money market transactions by imposing a withholding tax thereon, <span style="font-style: italic;">said bonds do not come within the purview of the 'commercial papers' intended to be subjected to the 35% transaction tax prescribed in Presidential Decree No. 1154</span>, as implemented by Revenue Regulations No. 7-77. (See Section 2 of said Regulation) Accordingly, <span style="font-style: italic;">PICOP is not subject to 35% transaction tax on its issues of the aforesaid bonds.</span>&nbsp; However, those investing in said bonds should be made aware of the fact that the transaction tax is not being imposed on the issuer of said bonds by printing or stamping thereon, in bold letters, the following statement: 'ISSUER NOT SUBJECT TO TRANSACTION TAX UNDER P.D. 1154. BONDHOLDER SHOULD DECLARE INTEREST EARNING FOR INCOME TAX.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>In the above quoted ruling, the CIR basically held that Picop's debenture bonds did not constitute "commercial papers" within the meaning of P.D. No. 1154, and that, as such, those bonds were not subject to the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax imposed by P.D. No. 1154.<br><br>The above ruling, however, is not applicable in respect of the promissory notes which are the subject matter of the instant case.&nbsp; It must be noted that the debenture bonds which were the subject matter of Commissioner Plana's ruling were long-term bonds maturing in ten (10) years and which could not be pre-terminated and could not be redeemed by Picop until after eight (8) years from date of issue; the bonds were moreover subordinated to present and future debts of Picop and convertible into common stock of Picop at the option of the bondholder.&nbsp; In contrast, the promissory notes involved in the instant case are short-term instruments bearing a one-year maturity period.&nbsp; These promissory notes constitute the very archtype of money market instruments.&nbsp; For money market instruments are precisely, by custom and usage of the financial markets, <span style="font-style: italic;">short-term </span>instruments with a tenor of one (1) year or less.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Assuming, therefore, (without passing upon) the correctness of the 6 October 1977 BIR ruling, Picop's short-term promissory notes must be distinguished, and treated differently, from Picop's long-term debenture bonds.<br><br>We conclude that Picop was properly held liable for the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax due in respect of interest payments on its money market borrowings.<br><br>At the same time, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the transaction tax may be levied only in respect of the interest earnings of Picop's money market lenders accruing after P.D. No. 1154 went into effect, and not in respect of all the 1977 interest earnings of such lenders.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals pointed out that:<br><br><blockquote>"PICOP, however, contends that even if the tax has to be paid, it should be imposed only for the interests earned after 20 September 1977 when PD 1154 creating the tax became effective. We find merit in this contention. <span style="font-style: italic;">It appears that the tax was levied on interest earnings from January to October, 1977</span>.&nbsp; However, as found by the lower court, PD 1154 was published in the Official Gazette only on 5 September 1977, and <span style="font-style: italic;">became effective only fifteen (15) days after the publication, or on 20 September 1977, no other effectivity date having been provided by the PD.&nbsp; Based on the Worksheet prepared by the Commissioner's office, the interests earned from 20 September to October 1977 was P10,224,410.03.&nbsp; Thirty-five (35%) per cent of this is P3,578,543.51 which is all PICOP should pay as transaction tax."</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>P.D. No. 1154 is not, in other words, to be given retroactive effect by imposing the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax in respect of interest earnings which accrued before the effectivity date of P.D.

The issuance of debenture bonds is certainly conceptually distinct from pulping and paper manufacturing operations. But no one contends that issuance of bonds was a principal or regular business activity of Picop; only banks or other financial institutions are in the regular business of raising money by issuing bonds or other instruments to the general public.&nbsp; We consider that the actual dedication of the proceeds of the bonds to the carrying out of Picop's registered operations constituted a sufficient nexus with such registered operations so as to exempt Picop from stamp taxes ordinarily imposed upon or in connection with issuance of such bonds.&nbsp; We agree, therefore, with the Court of Appeals on this matter that the CTA and the CIR had erred in rejecting Picop's claim for exemption from stamp taxes.<br><br>It remains only to note that after commencement of the present litigation before the CTA, the BIR took the position that the tax exemption granted by R.A.

Such "theoretical" or imputed interest does not arise from a legally demandable interest-bearing obligation incurred by the taxpayer who however wishes to find out, e.g., whether he would have been better off by lending out his funds and earning interest rather than investing such funds in his business.&nbsp; One thing that Section 79 quoted above makes clear is that interest which does constitute a charge arising under an interest-bearing obligation is an allowable deduction from gross income.<br><br>It is claimed by the CIR that Section 79 of Revenue Regulations No. 2 was "patterned after" paragraph 1.266-1 (b), entitled "Taxes and Carrying Charges Chargeable to Capital Account and Treated as Capital Items" of the U.S. Income Tax Regulations, which paragraph reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Taxes and Carrying Charges</span>. â The items thus chargeable to capital accounts are ?<br><br>(11)&nbsp;&nbsp; In the case of real property, whether improved or unimproved and whether productive or nonproductive.<br><br>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interest on a loan (but not theoretical interest of a taxpayer using his own funds)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote><br>The truncated excerpt of the U.S. Income Tax Regulations quoted by the CIR needs to be related to the relevant provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which provisions deal with the general topic of adjusted basis for determining allowable gain or loss on sales or exchanges of property and allowable depreciation and depletion of capital assets of the taxpayer:<br><br><blockquote>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Present Rule.</span> The Internal Revenue Code, and the Regulations promulgated thereunder provide that 'No deduction <span style="font-style: italic;">shall be allowed for amounts paid</span> or accrued <span style="font-style: italic;">for </span>such taxes and carrying charges as, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, are chargeable to capital account with respect to property, i<span style="font-style: italic;">f the taxpayer elects, in accordance with such regulations, to treat such taxes or charges as so chargeable.'</span><br><br>At the same time, under the adjustment of basis provisions which have just been discussed, it is provided that adjustment shall be made for all 'expenditures, receipts, losses, or other items' properly chargeable to a capital account; thus including taxes and carrying charges; however, <span style="font-style: italic;">an exception exists, in which event such adjustment to the capital account is not made, with respect to taxes and carrying charges which the taxpayer has not elected to capitalize but for which a deduction instead has been taken. </span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> (Italics supplied)</blockquote><br>The "carrying charges" which may be capitalized under the above quoted provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code include, as the CIR has pointed out, interest on a loan "(but not theoretical interest of a taxpayer using his own funds)."

To the contrary, losses must be deducted against current income<span style="font-style: italic;"> in the taxable year when such losses were incurred.&nbsp; Moreover, such losses may be charged off only against income earned in the same taxable year when the losses were incurred.</span><br><br>Thus it is that R.A. No. 5186 introduced the carry-over of net operating losses as a very special incentive to be granted only to registered pioneer enterprises and only with respect to their registered operations.&nbsp; The statutory purpose here may be seen to be the encouragement of the establishment and continued operation of pioneer industries by allowing the registered enterprise to accumulate its operating losses which may be expected during the early years of the enterprise and to permit the enterprise to offset such losses against income earned by it in later years after successful establishment and regular operations.&nbsp; To promote its economic development goals, the Republic foregoes or defers taxing the income of the pioneer enterprise until after that enterprise has recovered or offset its earlier losses.&nbsp; We consider that the statutory purpose can be served only if the accumulated operating losses are carried over and charged off against income subsequently earned and accumulated <span style="font-style: italic;">by the same enterprise engaged in the same registered operations.</span><br><br>In the instant case, to allow the deduction claimed by Picop would be to permit one corporation or enterprise, Picop, to benefit from the operating losses accumulated by another corporation or enterprise, RPPM.&nbsp; RPPM far from benefitting from the tax incentive granted by the BOI statute, in fact gave up the struggle and went out of existence and its former stockholders joined the much larger group of Picop's stockholders.&nbsp; To grant Picop's claimed deduction would be to permit Picop to shelter its otherwise taxable income (an objective which Picop had from the very beginning) which had not been earned by the registered enterprise which had suffered the accumulated losses.&nbsp; In effect, to grant Picop's claimed deduction would be to permit Picop to purchase a tax deduction and RPPM to peddle its accumulated operating losses. Under the CTA and Court of Appeals decisions, Picop would benefit by immunizing P44,196,106.00 of its income from taxation thereof although Picop had not run the risks and incurred the losses which had been encountered and suffered by RPPM.&nbsp; Conversely, the income that would be shielded from taxation is not income that was, after much effort, eventually generated by the same registered operations which earlier had sustained losses.&nbsp; We consider and so hold that there is nothing in Section 7 (c) of R.A. No. 5186 which either requires or permits such a result. Indeed, that result makes non-sense of the legislative purpose which may be seen clearly to be projected by Section 7 (c), R.A. No. 5186.<br><br>The CTA and the Court of Appeals allowed the offsetting of RPPM's accumulated operating losses against Picop's 1977 gross income, basically because towards the end of the taxable year 1977, upon the arrival of the effective date of merger, only one (1) corporation, Picop, remained.&nbsp; The losses suffered by RPPM's registered operations and the gross income generated by Picop's own registered operations now came under one and the same corporate roof.&nbsp; We consider that this circumstance relates much more to form than to substance.&nbsp; We do not believe that that single purely technical factor is enough to authorize and justify the deduction claimed by Picop.&nbsp; Picop's claim for deduction is not only bereft of statutory basis; it does violence to the legislative intent which animates the tax incentive granted by Section 7 (c) of R.A. No. 5186.&nbsp; In granting the extraordinary privilege and incentive of a net operating loss carry-over to BOI-registered pioneer enterprises, the legislature could not have intended to require the Republic to forego tax revenues in order to benefit a corporation which had run no risks and suffered no losses, but had merely purchased another's losses.<br><br>Both the CTA and the Court of Appeals appeared much impressed not only with corporate technicalities but also with the U.S. tax law on this matter.&nbsp; It should suffice, however, simply to note that in U.S. tax law, the availability to companies generally of operating loss carryÂ­-overs and of operating loss carry-backs is expressly provided and regulated in great detail by statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In our jurisdiction, save for Section 7 (c) of R.A.

xxx<br><br></div>What are the facts of this case on this matter? Why were adjustments necessary at the year-end?<br><br>Because of PICOP's procedure of recording its export sales (reckoned in U.S. dollars) on the basis of a fixed rate, day to day and month to month, regardless of the actual exchange rate and without waiting when the actual proceeds are received.&nbsp; In other words, PICOP recorded its export sales at a pre-determined fixed exchange rate.&nbsp; That pre-determined rate was decided upon at the beginning of the year and continued to be used throughout the year.<br><br>At the end of the year, the external auditors made an examination.&nbsp; In that examination, the auditors determined with accuracy the actual dollar proceeds of the export sales received.&nbsp; What exchange rate was used by the auditors to convert these actual dollar proceeds into Philippine pesos?&nbsp; They used the average of the differences between (a) the recorded fixed exchange rate and (b) the exchange rate at the time the proceeds were actually received.&nbsp; It was this rate at time of receipt of the proceeds that determined the amount of pesos credited by the Central Bank (through the agent banks) in favor of PICOP.&nbsp; These accumulated differences were averaged by the external auditors and this was what was used at the yearÂ­-end for income tax and other government-report purposes.&nbsp; (T.s.n., Oct. 17/85, pp. 20-25)"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></blockquote><br>The above explanation, unfortunately, at least to the mind of the Court, raises more questions than it resolves. Firstly, the explanation assumes that all of Picop's sales were export sales for which U.S. dollars (or other foreign exchange) were received.&nbsp; It also assumes that the expenses summed up as "cost of sales" were all dollar expenses and that no peso expenses had been incurred.&nbsp; Picop's explanation further assumes that a substantial part of Picop's dollar proceeds for its export sales were not actually surrendered to the domestic banking system and seasonably converted into pesos; had all such dollar proceeds been converted into pesos, then the peso figures could have been simply added up to reflect the actual peso value of Picop's export sales. Picop offered no evidence in respect of these assumptions, no explanation why and how a "pre-determined fixed exchange rate" was chosen at the beginning of the year and maintained throughout.&nbsp; Perhaps more importantly, Picop was unable to explain why its Books of Accounts did not pick up the same adjustments that Picop's External Auditors were alleged to have made for purposes of Picop's Income Tax Return.&nbsp; Picop attempted to explain away the failure of its Books of Accounts to reflect the same adjustments (no correcting entries, apparently) simply by quoting a passage from a case where this Court refused to ascribe much probative value to the Books of Accounts of a corporate taxpayer in a tax case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> What appears to have eluded Picop, however, is that its Books of Accounts, which are kept by its own employees and are prepared under its control and supervision, reflect what may be deemed to be admissions against interest in the instant case.&nbsp; For Picop's Books of Accounts precisely show higher sales figures and <span style="font-style: italic;">lower </span>cost of sales figures than Picop's Income Tax Return.<br><br>It is insisted by Picop that its Auditors' adjustments simply present the "best and most objective" method of reflecting in pesos the "correct and <span style="font-style: italic;">ACTUAL </span>export sales"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> and that the adjustments or "corrections" "did not result in realization of [additional] income and should not give rise to any deficiency tax." The correctness of this contention is not self-evident.&nbsp; So far as the record of this case shows, Picop did not submit in evidence the aggregate amount of its U.S. dollar proceeds of its export sales; neither did it show the Philippine pesos it had actually received or been credited for such U.S. dollar proceeds.&nbsp; It is clear to this Court that the testimonial evidence submitted by Picop fell far short of demonstrating the correctness of its explanation.<br><br>Upon the other hand, the CIR has made out at least a <i>prima facie</i> case that Picop had understated its sales and overstated its cost of sales as set out in its Income Tax Return. For the CIR has a right to assume that Picop's Books of Accounts speak the truth in this case since, as already noted, they embody what must appear to be admissions against Picop's own interest.<br><br>Accordingly, we must affirm the findings of the Court of Appeals and the CTA.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether Picop is liable for</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">the corporate development</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">tax of five percent (5%)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">of its income for 1977.</span><br><br>The five percent (5%) corporate development tax is an additional corporate income tax imposed in Section 24 (e) of the 1977 Tax Code which reads in relevant part as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"(e) <span style="font-style: italic;">Corporate development tax.</span> â&nbsp; In addition to the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section, an additional tax in an amount equivalent to 5 per cent of the same taxable net income shall be paid by a domestic or a resident foreign corporation; Provided, That this additional tax shall be imposed only if the net income exceeds 10 per cent of the net worth, in case of a domestic corporation, or net assets in the Philippines in case of a resident foreign corporation:&nbsp; x x x. <br><br>The additional corporate income tax imposed in this subsection shall be collected and paid at the same time and in the same manner as the tax imposed in subsection (a) of this section."</blockquote><br>Since this five percent (5%) corporate development tax is an<span style="font-style: italic;"> income tax,</span> Picop is not exempted from it under the provisions of Section 8 (a) of R.A.

liable for the thirty-five percent (35%) transaction tax in the amount of P3,578,543.51.<br><br>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Picop is not liable for interest and surcharge on unpaid transaction tax.<br><br>(3) Picop is exempt from payment of documentary and science stamp taxes in the amount of P300,000.00 and the compromise penalty of P300.00.<br><br>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Picop is entitled to its claimed deduction of P42,840,131.00 for interest payments on loans for, among other things, the purchase of machinery and equipment.<br><br>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp; Picop's claimed deduction in the amount of P44,196,106.00 for the operating losses previously incurred by RPPM, is disallowed for lack of merit.<br><br>(6)&nbsp; Picop's claimed deduction for certain financial guarantee expenses in the amount P1,237,421.00 is disallowed for failure adequately to prove such expenses.<br><br>(7) Picop has understated its sales by P2,391,644.00 and overstated its cost of sales by P604,018.00, for 1977.<br><br>(8)&nbsp;&nbsp; Picop is liable for the corporate development tax of five percent (5%) of its adjusted net income for 1977 in the amount of P2,434,367.75.<br><br>Considering conclusions

Feliciano has written for the Court the <i>ponencia </i>that presents in clear and logical sequence the issues, the facts and the law involved. While I share, in most part; the conclusions expressed in the opinion, I regrettably find it difficult, nevertheless, not to propose a re-examination of the Court's holding in Western Minolco Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (124 SCRA 121), reiterated in Marinduque Mining and Industrial Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (137 SCRA 88), that has taken the 35% transaction tax on commercial papers issued in the primary market under the 1977 Revenue Code, in relation to Republic Act ("R. A.") 5186, to be an income tax.<br><br>R. A. No. 5186, also known as the Investment Incentives Act, has provided for incentives by, among other things, granting to registered pioneer enterprises an exemption from all taxes, except income tax, under the National Internal Revenue Code.&nbsp; The income tax, referred to, in my view, is that imposed in Title II, entitled "Income Tax," of the Revenue Code.&nbsp; Nowhere under that title is there a 35% transaction tax.<br><br>There was, to be sure, a 35% transaction tax still in effect in 1977 but it was a tax <span style="font-style: italic;">not on the investor-lender </span>in whose favor the interest income on the commercial paper accrues.&nbsp; The tax was, instead, <span style="font-style: italic;">levied on the borrower-issuer</span> of commercial papers transacted in the primary market.&nbsp; Being the principal taxpayer, the borrower-issuer could not have been likewise contemplated to be a mere tax withholding agent.&nbsp; The tax was conceived as a tax on business transaction, and so it was rightly incorporated in Title V, entitled "Privilege Taxes on Business and Occupation" of the Tax Code.<br><br>The fact that a taxpayer on whom the tax is imposed can shift, characteristic of indirect taxes, the burden thereof to another does not make the latter the taxpayer and the former the withholding agent.&nbsp; Indeed, the facility of shifting the burden of the tax is opposed to the idea of a <span style="font-style: italic;">direct </span>tax to which class the income tax actually belongs.<br><br>Accordingly, I vote to so reduce the tax liability of petitioners as adjudged by the amount corresponding to the 35% transaction tax.&nbsp; In all other respects, I concur with the majority in the judgment.</div>
