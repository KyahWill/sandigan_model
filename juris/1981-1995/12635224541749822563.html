The issue posed in this application for the writ of habeas corpus is the
 validity of the detention of petitioner under an arrest, search and 
seizure order for alleged complicity in the killing of a certain Adriano
 Antonio, after he was already investigated by the Provincial Fiscal of 
Iloilo, without being there­after included in the information filed in 
such case. This Court issued the writ and required a return to the 
petition. In such return, there was an admission of the investigation 
conducted, but there was an allegation that the subsequent non-inclusion
 in the information did not bar the issuance of a search and seizure 
order. In a subsequent pleading, respondents explained why such search 
and seizure order was issued. The Philippine Constabulary Command in 
Iloilo was of the view that petitioner was one of those responsible for 
the crime of murder committed by a band, an offense falling within the 
jurisdiction of Military Tribunals. Such view was sustained by the then 
Acting Assistant Secretary of Legal Affairs of the Department of 
National Defense. On the basis thereof, the then Secretary of National 
Defense, now Defense Minister, Juan Ponce Enrile, issued the arrest and 
seizure order.
<p>
It turned out that after the lifting of martial law petitioner was 
released. That was set forth in a Manifestation filed with this Court on
 May 5, 1983 by Solicitor Dominador G. Cariaso of the Office of the 
Solicitor General. He referred to the information coming from "Atty. 
Jose Mercado of the Legal Division of the Philippine Constabulary, 
Criminal Investigation Service, Camp Crame, Quezon City [that] 
petitioner Emiliano Dulaogon was released on July 12, 1982."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  The prayer in such Manifestation was for the dismissal of this 
petition on the ground of its being moot and academic. Subsequently, 
there was confirmation of petitioner no longer being in detention from a
 Mani­festation filed by his counsel, stating: "He has personal 
knowledge that petitioner Emiliano Dulaogon was already released from 
confinement and is now residing in Barangay Rosario, Dumangas, Iloilo."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, this petition is dismissed for being moot and academic.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, Aquino, Abad Santos, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr., De La Fuente,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr.,</em> and <em>Guerrero, JJ.</em>, did not take part.
