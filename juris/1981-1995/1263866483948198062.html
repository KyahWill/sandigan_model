being null and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">void, </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">notice </span>of levy predicated upon said

circulation and the corresponding Certificate of Sale was issued to the highest

with the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> under Act 3344.</p>

</span>(p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is basic, that a petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">for </span>prohibition must be based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">on </span>jurisdictional grounds against the trial court’s judgment
because, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">as long </span>as the trial
court acted with jurisdiction, any error committed by it in the exercise
thereof will amount to nothing more than an error of judgment which is <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> only by a timely appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The allegation in the
instant petition of lack of jurisdiction, notwithstanding, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that the question raised therein, which is the propriety of awarding moral
and exemplary </span>damages, is merely an error in judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proper remedy of petitioners should have
been an appeal to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioners took the
proper move when they appealed the decision of the lower court to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, however, for
them their appeal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not perfected because of their failure to pay
the docket fee and to file the required printed Record on Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence their appeal was dismissed and the
trial court’s decision lapsed into finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are now precluded from questioning the validity of this final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As this Court held in Agricultural and Industrial Marketing Corporation,
118 SCRA 49, re-echoed in Santos Jr. v. Court of Appeals, 152 SCRA 378, “it is </span>beyond
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">question that the perfection of an
appeal within the statutory </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">period
is mandatory and jurisdictional and </span>that failure to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">so </span>perfect an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">appeal renders </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">final </span>and
<span class="SpellE">executory</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
questioned decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of the
appeal period deprives the courts of jurisdiction to alter </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">final judgment and the prevailing party
becomes entitled as a matter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> rights to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">execution and for the
court, it becomes its ministerial duty to order the execution of judgment.” The
doctrine of finality of judgments </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">grounded on fundamental considerations
of public </span>policy and sound practice that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">at </span>the risk of occasional error the judgments of the courts must
become final at some definite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">date
fixed by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Philippine Rabbit Bus
Lines, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Arciaga</span>, 148 SCRA 433) Even an
erroneous imposition of penalty cannot be modified anymore after the judgment
has become final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Castillo v. <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, 137 SCRA 210)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The instant petition for
prohibition was filed long after the trial court’s decision had become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Time a</span>nd again <span class="GramE">We</span> have dismissed
petitions for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to annul decisions or orders
which could have, but have not been appealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter as respondent
Judge has in this case, the orders or decisions upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">all </span>questions pertaining to the cause are orders or decisions
within its jurisdiction, and however erroneous they may be, <span class="GramE">they</span>
cannot be corrected by <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These special <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">civil </span>actions do not lie where the remedy by appeal has been lost
because <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">said special civil </span>actions
cannot take the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">place of an
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Dela</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Cruz </span>v. IAC, 134 SCRA 417; <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
Jr. <span class="GramE">v</span>. Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Appeals,
</span>supra).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, petitioners
had no valid excuse to resort to the extraordinary writs of <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition when appeal had been available to them and which they, in fact,
already initiated but did n<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ot </span>pursue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> v.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 153 SCRA 104).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as may be seen from the petition itself, the only prayer
of petitioners is for this Court “to issue an order enjoining the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Sheriff Ex-Officio, </span><span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Unson</span>, or his
deputies to desist from executing the decision in Civil Case No. 5654 referred
to above and desist from levying the properties of the petitioners.” (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) As already earlier pointed <span class="GramE">out,</span>
however, the properties subject of the Notice of Levy issued pursuant to the
writ of execution were in fact sold at public auction on <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1969</st1:date> which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
