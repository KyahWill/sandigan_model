				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>petition
for <i>certiorari</i> to set aside the Resolutions of the public respondent
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) dated <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1987</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="5">May
 29, 1987</st1:date> affirming the Decision of <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1985</st1:date> rendered by Labor Arbiter Julio P. Andres,
Jr. holding that:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> respondent <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping
Corporation could not <span class="GramE">be</span> guilty of said charge (unfair
labor practice through dismissal) for lack of employer-employee relationship
between them and the individual complainants at the time said act was allegedly
committed in April 1985.” (p. 165, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">and</span> consequently
dismissing the case for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this petition anchored on two grounds:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“1.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION COMMITTED BY
THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION WHICH AMOUNTS TO LACK OF JURISDICTION.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THE</span> RESOLUTIONS SOUGHT TO BE REVIEWED
ARE NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE COURT.”
(p. 2 Comment, p. 166, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The real issue however which surfaces from the allegations and
arguments of the parties is whether or not an employer-employee relationship
existed between respondent <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping
Corporation (ABOITIZ, for short) and the petitioners-workers at the time of the
latter’s alleged dismissal on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>(6)
petitioners herein claimed that they were employed as carpenters by <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> until their illegal dismissal on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that they were all allegedly
dismissed by Ben <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and his spouse on April 26,
1985 just a day after the inspection made by <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
Bautista of the National Capital Region of the Ministry of Labor and Employment
on respondent ABOITIZ in connection with LSED-4-408-85, a labor case which same
complainants filed with the Ministry of Labor and Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the complainants, said act of
the <span class="SpellE">Baguios</span> constitute unfair labor practice defined
under par. (f) <span class="GramE">of</span> Article 249 of the Labor Code, as
amended, and the resultant dismissal of the individual complainants is illegal
as there was allegedly no just cause nor were they duly afforded due process of
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They thus, pray that the respondent
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">corporation </span>be held liable for
unfair labor practice through dismissal, damages and attorney’s fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent ABOITIZ denies that the petitioners were their
employees at the time of their dismissal but are employees of respondent Ben <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> by virtue of a Service Contract dated <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A pertinent portion of which reads <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“8.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That it is
understood and agreed that there is no employer-employee relationship between
the FIRST PARTY (<span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping Corporation) and
SECOND PARTY (<span class="SpellE">Narben’s</span> Service Contractor) much less
any of the latter’s carpenters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
SECOND PARTY shall have the right to hire and fire such employees, exercise
general control as to the time, manner and method of performance of work; that
the sole interest of the FIRST PARTY is that all its properties, cargoes,
equipments and other appurtenances be safe and protected from destruction,
pilferage, damage and other losses as envisioned in paragraph 9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The SECOND PARTY shall hold free from any
liability the FIRST PARTY from any claim of whatsoever nature which the carpenters
of the SECOND PARTY may institute either against the FIRST PARTY and SECOND PARTY.”</p>

Resolution; pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On their part, spouses Ben and <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> aver that they are the proprietors of <span class="SpellE">Narben’s</span> Service Contractor engaged in contracting
carpentry jobs and <span class="GramE">has</span> a service contract with
respondent <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> Shipping Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Spouses <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
admit that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the petitioners were </span>indeed
their employees whose duties were to do carpentry work, subject to the
condition that the moment their works were finished, their employment would
end, and that they would be re-hired once respondent ABOITIZ would enter into
another contract.</p>

<blockquote>(Memorandum
of Petitioners, p. 212, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">They therefore pray that the resolutions
of public respondent be set aside; that this Court declare the illegality of
dismissal of individual petitioners; and that their reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to private respondent as regular employees
thereof be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="4">April
 18, 1988</st1:date>, this Court gave due course to the petition and required
the parties to file their simultaneous memoranda within thirty (30) days from
notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records reveal that petitioners are not regular employees of the
private respondent at the time of their alleged illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one, petitioners, on <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1984</st1:date>, filed individual application for
employment with <span class="SpellE">Narben’s</span> Service Contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were eventually issued <span class="SpellE">payslips</span>, deducted SSS premiums, <span class="SpellE">Pag-ibig</span>
fund and <span class="SpellE">witholding</span> tax from their salaries by this
Contractor.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mafinco</u></span> <u>Trading</u>
<u>Corporation</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ople</u></span>, 70 SCRA
139 (1976), the existence of employer-employee relationship is determined by
four (4) elements, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the
power of dismissal; and (4) the power to control employees’ conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>reading of the provisions of the aforesaid service contract, the
concurrence of these four elements on <span class="SpellE">NARBEN’s</span> will
easily be noted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For <span class="SpellE">NARBEN’s</span> had the right to hire the necessary number of
carpenters to accomplish the carpentry requirements of respondent corporation
and to fire them.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It had charge
of the payment of wages of its laborers and the power of administrative
supervision and general control as to the time, manner and method of
performance of work.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the above evidences constitute positive proofs that the
petitioners-workers were, at the time in question, in the employ of <span class="SpellE">NARBEN’s</span> and not anymore of <span class="GramE">respondent</span>
Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent NLRC, therefore,
did not err in refusing to give weight to petitioners’ uncorroborated claim
that they were continuously employees of <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span>
Shipping Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the issuance of ID’s to petitioners by private
respondent, it appears that these ID’s <span class="GramE">were</span> special
ID’s and is different from those issued to its regular employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hese
special identification cards, the following words are written:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THE BEARER WHOSE
PICTURE APPEAR ON THIS CARD IS AUTHORIZED <u>TO</u> <u>HAUL,</u> <u>OPERATE,</u>
<u>AND</u> <u>TRANSACT</u> BUSINESS WITH ABOITIZ SHIPPING CORPORATION.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, appearing on the regular </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">probationary employee’s ID cards are the following words:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<u>THIS</u> <u>IS</u> <u>TO</u> <u>CERTIFY</u>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the issue of the existence of employer-employee
relationship between the parties in the case at bar is a question of fact which
has already been resolved by the labor arbiter and upheld by the National Labor
Relations Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Review of labor
cases are confined to questions of jurisdiction or grave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find that no grave abuse of discretion was
committed by public respondent NLRC in affirming the non-existence of
employer-employee relationship between petitioners and private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
