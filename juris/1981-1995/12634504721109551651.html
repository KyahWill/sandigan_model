NLRC Executive Director Bolisay, the NLRC shall issue a temporary restraining
order, to restrain the im­plementation of the writ of execution issued by the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The foregoing letter was
delivered to respondent Lumuthang on November P9,1978, by Alfredo Escandor, a
representative of the com­plainants, who found Lumuthang and Letada together
with Atty. Lucilo Regis (counsel for the claimants in the above-mentioned NLRC
cases) at the complainants' logging compound in Maco, Davao del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time the respondents were actually in
the process of levying on the properties of the complainants at the compound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notwithstanding
Escandor's plea for suspension of the levy and assurance that measures will be
taken so that respondents could immediately communicate with Liwanag Aguirre to
verify the report contained in the letter, the respondents continued the
seizure of the complainants' properties, consisting of 5 motor vehicles and
other personal properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainants' properties were thus taken from its logging compound
at Maco, Davao del Norte, and brought to the Free Farmers Federation compound
at Fabe Subdivision, Tagum, <span class="GramE">Davao</span> del Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1978</st1:date>, the NLRC Regional Office received and in turn served upon
the respondents a copy of the NLRC resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1978</st1:date>, containing the
restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, complainants obtained the return of the
properties seized by the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complainants, thus,
allege that with obvious partiality and grave abuse of discretion amounting to
grave misconduct, respondent sheriffs elected to rely upon the advice of Atty.
Regis, and with obvious discourtesy in the performance of their official duty,
ignored and unceremoniously rebuffed or disregarded the information contained
in the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further alleged
that the writ of execution had been with the respondents from November 8 to 19,
1978, without serving the same; that no prejudice could have resulted if the
respondents had suspended the levy on November 19, 1978, which was actually a
Sunday, until they could verify the contents of Atty. Angeles' letter; and that
in making the levy, the respondents were motivated by malice and intent to
oppress, harass, embarrass and besmirch the personal, social and business
reputation of the complainants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The gist of the
respondents' joint comment (dated February 22, 1979), is that they could not
have relied merely on the letter of Atty. Angeles, who being counsel for the
complainants could not have been "neutral or impartial".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No restraining order was presented to them, </span>they
claim; and neither was Liwanag Aguirre presented to explain the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">They also said that they had to serve the writ of execution on
the complainants on <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="11">Sunday, November
 19, 1978</st1:date>, because that was the only day of the week when
complainants' motor vehicles could be found at their compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that they only followed an
order from a proper authority and conducted the levy according to law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation, Executive Judge Alfredo Lagamon, Court
of First Instance at Tagum, Davao del Norte, submitted an investigation report
dated February 24, 1981, which states that:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="GramE">records of the case was</span> received
on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first hearing was scheduled on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1981</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant through <span class="GramE">counsel,</span>
filed an urgent motion for transfer of hearing on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said motion was granted and trial was re-scheduled and set for hearing
on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1981</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1981</st1:date>,
the day of the hearing, complainant and his lawyer, Atty. Blasito E. Angeles
appeared in Court and manifested that they are ready for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents also appeared with their
lawyer, Atty. Pedro C. Buhion and informed the Court that they are also ready
for trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court informed the parties that the hearing of the case
shall be conducted in chambers because the proceedings are confidential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the complainant and the respondents
were in chambers together with their lawyers, they jointly prayed for a recess
and after said recess, complainant through counsel informed the Court that they
are not submitting any testimonial evidence but would like the Court to
appreciate their complaint on the basis of the documentary evidence annexed to
the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents through <span class="GramE">counsel,</span> also made the same manifestations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the parties have come to an
amicable settlement after the respondents explained to the complainant their
positions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are issues however, which still must be considered, supported
by documentary evidence and admitted by the respondents, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on <st1:date year="1978" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1978</st1:date>, the NLRC en banc
approved a resolution enjoining among others the respondents from executing or
enforcing the writ of execution in question;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Atty. Blasito E.
Angeles, counsel for the complainant, sent a letter to the respondent, Glicerio
Lumuthang, requesting him to confer with Mr. Aguirre, NLRC Regional Office XI,
Davao City, about a temporary restraining order issued by the NLRC and requesting
further that no further action on the writ of execution shall be made until
official advice or instruction shall have been received from Mr. Aguirre;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondents admitted
these facts in their answer but since no copy of the restraining order was shown
to respondent Glicerio Lumuthang, he opted to continue with the levy,
completely disregarding the request of Atty. Blasito E. Angeles, counsel for
the complainant.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the opinion of the undersigned that respondent Deputy
Sheriff Glicerio Lumuthang should not have <span class="GramE">proceeded</span>
with the execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have easily
checked with the NLRC, Regional Office at <st1:place><st1:placename>Davao</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and verify if indeed there was
a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A delay
of a few hours could not have prejudiced the prevailing parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this act of indiscretion, the undersigned
believes that respondent Lumuthang should be given a warning to be more prudent
in the future.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There seems to be no evidence against respondent Antonio
Letada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only assisted in the
execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision to proceed with
the levy was the sole responsibility of respondent Glicerio Lumuthang.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the investigating judge that Lumuthang is indeed
culpable but we cannot accept his recommendation that said respondent be given
a mere warning.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In determining the
appropriate penalty to be meted to Lumuthang, it is pertinent to mention the
decision and resolution rendered by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in other
administrative cases involving said respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">In Administrative Matter No.</span> P-1549, entitled
"Raul C. Briz versus Deputy Sheriffs Faustino Encinares, Jr., and Glicerio
Lumuthang, etc.", We found the respondents guilty of incompetence and
grave abuse of authority amounting to oppression and grave misconduct and meted
the penalty of suspension from office for one month without pay with stern
warning that repetition of the same or similar infractions will be dealt with
more severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in Administrative
Matter No. 1264-MJ, entitled "Glicerio Lumuthang versus Judge Juanito de
Leon, etc.”, We resolved to dismiss the complaint against the judge for failure
of the complainant to prosecute the case and We further resolved to require the
complainant Glicerio Lumuthang to show cause why he should not be disciplinary
dealt with or held in contempt for filing a false or groundless complaint and
failing to appear and prosecute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In view of the recidivism
of respondent Lumuthang, he deserves a severe penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="GramE">We</span>
agree with the investigating </span>judge that respondent Antonio Letada is
blameless.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> for repeated misconduct in office,
respondent Deputy Sheriff Glicerio Lumuthang is hereby considered resigned from
the service effective upon receipt of this decision with prejudice to
reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other respondent,
Deputy Sheriff Antonio Letada, is hereby absolved from the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
