				G.R. No. L-54204, September 30, 1982</h4>
				<H3>NORSE MANAGEMENT CO. (PTE) AND PACIFIC SEAMEN SERVICES, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL SEAMEN BOARD, HON. CRESCENCIO M. SIDDAYAO, OSCAR M. TORRES, REBENE C. CARRERA AND RESTITUTA C. ABORDO, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>RELOVA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this petition for <em>certiorari</em>, petitioners pray that the order 
dated June 20, 1979 of the National Seamen Board, and the decision dated 
December 11, 1979 of the Ministry of Labor be nullified and set aside, and that 
"if petitioners are found liable to private respondent, such a liability be 
reduced to P30 ,000.00 only, in accordance with respondent NSB's Standard Format 
of a Service Agreement." 
<p>Napoleon B. Abordo, the deceased husband of private respondent Restituta C. 
Abordo, was the Second Engineer of M.T. "Cherry Earl" when he died from an 
apoplectic stroke in the course of his employment with petitioner NORSE 
MANAGEMENT COMPANY (PTE).&nbsp; The M.T. "Cherry Earl" is a vessel of Singaporean 
Registry.&nbsp; The late Napoleon B. Aberdo at the time of his death was receiving a 
monthly salary of US$850.00 (Petition, page 5). </p>
<p>In her complaint for "death compensation benefits, accrued leave pay and 
time-off allowances, funeral expenses, attorney's fees and other benefits and 
reliefs available in connection with the death of Napoleon B. Abordo," filed 
before the National Seamen Board, Restituta C. Abordo alleged that the amount of 
compensation due her from petitioners Norse Management Co. (PTE) and Pacific 
Seamen Services, Inc., principal and agent, respectively, should be based on the 
law where the vessel is registered.&nbsp; On the other hand, petitioners contend that 
the law of Singapore should not be applied in this case because the National 
Seamen Board cannot take judicial notice of the Workmen's Insurance Law of 
Singapore.&nbsp; As an alternative, they offered to pay private respondent Restituta 
C. Abordo the sum of P30 ,000.00 as death benefits based on the Board's 
Memorandum Circular No. 25 which they claim should apply in this case. </p>
<p>The Hearing Officer III, Rebene C. Carrera of the Ministry of Labor and 
Employment, after hearing the case, rendered judgment on June 20, 1979, ordering 
herein petitioners "to pay jointly and severally the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I. &nbsp;&nbsp; US$30,600 (the 36-month salary of the deceased) or its equivalent in 
Philippine currency as death compensation benefits; </p>
<p>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; US$500.00 or its equivalent in Philippine currency as funeral 
expenses; </p>
<p>III.&nbsp;&nbsp; US$3,110 or 10% of the total amount recovered as attorney's fees. </p>
<p>"It is also ordered that payment must be made thru the National Seamen Board 
within ten (10) days from receipt of this decision." </p></blockquote>
<p>Petitioners appealed to the Ministry of Labor.&nbsp; On December 11, 1979, the 
Ministry rendered its decision in this case as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Motion for reconsideration filed by respondents from the Order of this Board 
dated 20 June 1979 requiring them to pay-complainant, jointly and severally, the 
amount of Thirty-four thousand and two hundred ten dollars ($34,210.00) 
representing death benefits, funeral expenses and attorney's fees. </p>
<p>"The facts in the main are not disputed.&nbsp; The deceased, husband of 
complainant herein, was employed as a Second Engineer by respondents and served 
as such in the vessel 'M.T. Cherry Earl' until that fatal day in May 1978 when, 
while at sea, he suffered an apoplectic stroke and died four days later or on 29 
May 1978.&nbsp; In her complaint filed before this Board, Abordo argued that the 
amount of compensation due her should be based on the law where the vessel is 
registered, which is Singapore law.&nbsp; Agreeing with said argument, this Board 
issued the questioned Order.&nbsp; Hence this Motion for Reconsideration. </p>
<p>"In their motion for reconsideration, respondents strongly argue that the law 
of Singapore should not be applied in the case considering that their 
responsibility was not alleged in the complaint that no proof of the existence 
of the Workmen's Insurance Law of Singapore was ever presented and that the 
Board cannot take judicial notice of the Workmen's Insurance Law of Singapore.&nbsp; 
As an alternative, they offered to pay complainant the amount of Thirty Thousand 
Pesos (P30 ,000.00) as death benefits based on this Board's Memorandum Circular 
No. 25 which, they maintained, should apply in this case. </p>
<p>"The only issue we are called upon to rule is whether or not the law of 
Singapore ought to be applied in this case. </p>
<p>"After an exhaustive study of jurisprudence on the matter, we rule in the 
affirmative.&nbsp; Respondents came out with a well-prepared motion which, to our 
mind, is more appropriate and perhaps acceptable in the regular court of 
justice.&nbsp; Nothing is raised in their motion but question of evidence.&nbsp; But 
evidence is usually a matter of procedure of which this Board, being merely a 
quasi-judicial body, is not strict about. </p>
<p>"It is true that the law of Singapore was not alleged and proved in the 
course of the hearing.&nbsp; And following Supreme Court decisions in a long line of 
cases that a foreign law, being a matter of evidence, must be alleged and 
proved, the law of Singapore ought not to be recognized in this cases.&nbsp; But it 
is our considered opinion that the jurisprudence on this matter was never meant 
to apply to cases before administrative or quasi-judicial bodies such as the 
National Seamen Board.&nbsp; For well-settled also is the rule that administrative 
and quasi-judicial bodies are not bound strictly by technical rules.&nbsp; It has 
always been the policy of this Board, as enunciated in a long line of cases, 
that in cases of valid claims for benefits on account of injury or death while 
in the course of employment, the law of the country in which the vessel is 
registered shall be considered.&nbsp; We see no reason to deviate from this 
well-considered policy.&nbsp; Certainly not on technical grounds as movants herein 
would like us to. </p>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is hereby denied and the Order of 
this Board dated 20 June 1979 affirmed.&nbsp; Let execution issue immediately." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In Section 5(B) of the "Employment Agreement" between Norse Management Co. 
(PTE) and the late Napoleon B. Abordo, which is Annex "C" of the Supplemental 
Complaint, it was stipulated that: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the event of illness or injury to Employee arising out of and in the 
course of his employment and not due to his own willful misconduct and occurring 
whilst on board any vessel to which he may be assigned, but not any other time, 
the EMPLOYER will provide employee with free medical attention, including 
hospital treatment, also essential medical treatment in the course of 
repatriation and until EMPLOYEE's arrival at his point of origin.&nbsp; If such 
illness or injury, incapacitates the EMPLOYEE to the extent the EMPLOYEE'S 
services must be terminated as determined by a qualified physician designated by 
the EMPLOYER and provided such illness or injury was not due in part or whole to 
his willful act, neglect or misconduct compensation shall be paid to employee in 
accordance with and subject to the limitations of the Workmen's Compensation Act 
of the Republic of the Philippines or the Workmen’s Insurance Law of registry of 
the vessel whichever is greater." ( underscoring for emphasis) </p></blockquote>
<p>In the aforementioned "Employment Agreement" between petitioners and the late 
Napoleon B. Abordo, it is clear that compensation shall be paid under Philippine 
Law or the law of registry of petitioners' vessel, whichever is greater.&nbsp; Since 
private respondent Restituta C. Abordo was offered P30 ,000.00 only by the 
petitioners, Singapore law was properly applied in this case. </p>
<p>The "Employment Agreement" is attached to the Supple­mental Complaint of 
Restituta C. Abordo and, therefore, it forms part thereof.&nbsp; As it is familiar 
with Singapore Law, the National Seamen Board is justified in taking judicial 
notice of and in applying that law.&nbsp; In the case of Vir-Jen Shipping and Marine 
Services, Inc. vs. National Seamen Board, et al (L-41297), the respondent Board 
promulgated a decision, as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The facts established and/or admitted by the parties are the following:&nbsp; 
that the late Remigio Roldan was hired by the respondent as Ordinary Seamen on 
board the M/V ' Singapura Pertama’, a vessel of Singapore Registry; that on 
September 27, 1973, the deceased Remigio Roldan met an accident resulting in his 
death while on board the said M/V ' Singapura Pertama' during the performance of 
his duties; that on December 3, 1973, the respondent Virjen Shipping and Marine 
Services, Inc. paid to the complainant Natividad Roldan the amount of P6,000.00 
representing Workmen's Compensation benefits and donations of the company; that 
the amount of P4,870 was spent by the respondent company as burial expenses of 
the deceased Remigio Roldan. </p>
<p>"The only issue therefore remaining to be resolved by the Board in connection 
with the particular case, is whether or not under the existing laws (Philippine 
and foreign), the complainant Natividad Roldan is entitled to additional 
benefits other than those mentioned earlier.&nbsp; The Board takes judicial notice, 
(as a matter of fact, the respondent having admitted in its memorandum) of the 
fact that ' Singapura Pertama' is a foreign vessel of Singapore Registry and it 
is the policy of this Board that in case of award of benefits to seamen who were 
either injured in the performance of its duties or who died while in the course 
of employment is to consider the benefits allowed by the country where the 
vessel is registered.&nbsp; Likewise, the Board takes notice that Singapore maritime 
laws relating to workmen's compensation benefits are similar to that of the 
Hongkong maritime laws which provides that in case of death, the heirs of the 
deceased seaman should receive the equivalent of 36 months wages of the deceased 
seaman; in other words, 36 months multiplied by the basic monthly wages.&nbsp; In the 
employment contract submitted with this Board, the terms of which have never 
been at issue, is shown that the monthly salary of the deceased Remigio Roldan 
at the time of his death was US$80.00; such that, 36 months multiplied by $80 
would come up to US$2,880 and at the rate of P7.00 to $1.00, the benefits due 
the claimant would be P20 ,160.&nbsp; However, since there was voluntary payment made 
in the amount of P6 ,000 and funeral expenses which under the Workmen's 
Compensation Law had a maximum of P200.00, the amount of P6,200.00 should be 
deducted from P20,160 and the difference would be P13,960.00. </p>
<p>"<strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the Board orders the respondent Virjen Shipping 
and Marine Services, Inc. to pay the complainant Natividad Roldan the amount of 
P13 ,960.00 within ten (10) days from receipt of this Decision.&nbsp; The Board also 
orders the respondent that payment should be made through the National Seamen 
Board." </p></blockquote>
<p>The foregoing decision was assailed as null and void for allegedly having 
been rendered without jurisdiction and for awarding compensation benefits beyond 
the maximum allowable and on the ground of res judicata.&nbsp; This Court in its 
resolutions dated October 27, 1975 and December 12, 1975, respectively, 
dismissed for lack of merit the petition as well as the motion for 
reconsideration in said G.R. No. L-41297. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 20, Labor Code of the Philippines, provides that the 
National Seamen Board has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all matters 
or cases including money claims, involving employer-employee relations, arising 
out of or by virtue of any law or contracts involving Filipino seamen for 
overseas employment.&nbsp; Thus, it is safe to assume that the Board is familiar with 
pertinent Singapore maritime laws relative to workmen's compensation.&nbsp; Moreover, 
the Board may apply the rule on judicial notice and, "in administrative 
proceedings, the technical rules of procedure - particularly of evidence - 
applied in judicial trials, do not strictly apply." ( Oromeca Lumber Co. Inc. 
vs. Social Security Commission, 4 SCRA 1188). </p>
<p>Finally, Article IV of the Labor Code provides that "all doubts in the 
implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this code, including its 
implementing rules and regulations, shall be resolved in favor of labor." </p>
<p>For lack of merit, this petition is DENIED. </p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED. </strong></p>
