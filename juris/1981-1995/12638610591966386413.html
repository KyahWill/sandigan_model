seek the reversal of the February 13, 1978 decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. No. 52567-R, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Castillo,

dismissal by the Court of First Instance of Manila of the complaint for damages
filed by petitioners against private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said dismissal was decreed on the basis of
the evidence before the trial court as well as the decision of the Court of
Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 07684-CR, entitled "People v. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>

<p class="BODY">The parties have conflicting versions as to what actually
transpired on that fateful day; each party pointing to the negligence of the
other as the proximate cause of the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, as expected in cases like this, the main issue is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Who was at fault?</p>

north).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to evade the impending
collision, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Castillo swerved his
jeep to the right towards the shoulder and applied on the brakes, and leaving
his feet on it, even, immediately after the impact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The car rested on the shoulder of the right
lane.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jeep's rear left wheel was on
the road, leaving short <span class="SpellE">tiremarks</span> behind it; while
the car left long tire-marks, specially its left rear wheel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jeep suffered a shattered windshield,
pushed-in radiator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The left mid-portion
of its bumper badly dented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The car had
a flat tire on its right front wheel; its right fender badly dented as the
headlamp on top of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bumper
stooped downward, because it went thru under the bumper of the jeep.</blockquote>

physical injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>

truck, the car's front left tire suddenly burst due to pressure causing the car
to swerve to the left and naturally making steering and control difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the tendency of the car to veer
towards the left due to the blown out tire, the driver steered the car towards
the direction where he could find a safe place to park and fix the tire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally brought the car to a halt at the
left shoulder of the road (facing south).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

The petitioners-appellants raise in issue before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
the following questions, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1)
Is the decision of the Court of Appeals, where its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part, or "<span class="SpellE">fallo</span>", states that the guilt of
the (appellant) accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt final and
conclusive, on an action for damages based on quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>?;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2)
Are the testimonies given in a criminal case, without strict compliance with
Section 41 Rule 130 and without opportunity to cross?examine the
witnesses who made these testimonies, admissible evidence in a subsequent case
and can be the basis of a valid decision?;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3)
Is an action for damages based on quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> barred
by a decision of the appellate court acquitting the accused, the body of which
lays the blame on the plaintiff but in its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part declares the guilt of the accused not proved beyond reasonable
doubt?"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of this petition for review which stems from a
cause of action based on quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> or culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span> (being a recovery for damages arising from the
vehicular accident), is that petitioners were deprived of due process because
their civil action was decided on the basis of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario's acquittal in the criminal case for
reckless imprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the subject action for damages, being
civil in nature, is separate and distinct from the criminal aspect, necessitating
only a preponderance of evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to a number of cases,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
a quasi­-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> or culpa <span class="SpellE">aquiliana</span>
is a separate legal institution under the Civil Code, with a <span class="SpellE">substantivity</span> all its own, and individuality that is
entirely apart and independent from a <span class="SpellE">delict</span> or
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A distinction exists between the
civil liability arising from a crime and the responsibility for quasi-<span class="SpellE">delicts</span> or culpa extra-contractual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same negligence causing damages may
produce civil liability arising from a crime under the Penal Code, or create an
action for quasi-<span class="SpellE">delictos</span> or culpa extra-contractual
under the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the
acquittal or conviction in the criminal case is entirely irrelevant in the
civil case."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Azucena</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Potenciano</span></u>,
L-14028, June 30, 1962, 5 SCRA 468, 470-471, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in the criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting in
serious physical injuries x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
the judgment of acquittal does not operate to extinguish the civil liability of
the defendant based on the same incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The civil action is entirely independent of the criminal case according
to Articles 33 and 2177 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no logical conclusion than this, for to subordinate the
civil action contemplated in the said articles to the result of the criminal
prosecution - whether it be conviction or acquittal - would render meaningless
the independent character of the civil action and the clear injunction in
Article 31, that his action may proceed independently of the criminal
proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"But this rule is not without exception.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 2 (c) of Rule 111 of the Rules
of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it
extinction of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration from
a final judgment that the fact from which the civil action might arise did not
exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a previous case, CA-G.R. No. 07684-CR, People v. Rosario, the
Court of Appeals after a painstaking analysis of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the testimonial evidence; (b) the
relative positions of the two vehicles as depicted in the sketches; (c) the
distance of each of the two vehicles from the cemented edge of the road; (d)
the point of impact; (e) the visible tire marks; and (f) the extent of the
damage caused upon each of the two vehicles, ruled that it was the driver of
the jeep and not the accused driver of the car who was negligent and
accordingly acquitted the latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Negligence, being the source and foundation of actions of quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>, is the basis for the recovery of damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the Court of Appeals
found that no negligence was committed by <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>
Rosario to warrant an award of damages to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Appellate Court states:</p>

<blockquote>"In acquitting defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario in CA-G.R. No. 07684-CR on October 28,
1968, this Court held that the collision was not due to the negligence of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario but<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'it was Castillo's own act of driving the jeep to the shoulder [of the
road] where the car was that was actually the proximate cause of the
collision.’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 183) With
this finding, this Court actually exonerated <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario from civil liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since plaintiffs-appellants' civil action is
predicated upon <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario's alleged negligence
which does not exist, it follows that his acquittal in the criminal action,
which is already final, carried with it the extinction of civil responsibility
arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">It was the Court of Appeals' findings that the collision was not
due to the negligence of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario but rather
it was Castillo's own act of driving the jeep to the shoulder of the road where
the car was, which was actually the proximate cause of the collision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With <span class="GramE">this findings</span>,
the Court of Appeals exonerated <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Rosario from
civil liability on the ground that the alleged negligence did not exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the questioned decision of the Court of
Appeals was an affirmation of the decision of the Court of First Instance of
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the trial of the case
before the Court of First Instance, the private respondents were not present,
in view of the fact that they were out of the country at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their counsel introduced as part of their
evidence, the records in the criminal case, in accordance with Section 41 Rule
130 of the Rules of Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
These records were attached to their "Request for Admission" and were
substantially admitted by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said records were mostly composed of transcripts of the hearing in
the criminal case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners raised,
as one of their objections, the propriety and correctness of admitting and
adopting these transcripts as part of the record in the civil case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to them, this is a violation of
Section 41, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, on the ground that petitioners were
not given the opportunity to cross-examine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have to disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A careful
reading of the transcripts would reveal that then counsel for petitioners,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nicodemo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
actively participated during the proceedings of the criminal case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He raised various objections<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
in the course of the trials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners, therefore, thru counsel had the opportunity to
cross-examine the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the admission of the said testimonies cannot be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in a long line of decisions, this Court has held time
and again that the findings of facts by the Court of Appeals are conclusive and
