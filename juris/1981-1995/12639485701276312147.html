				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Consolidated special civil actions for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to review the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> of the Third Division, National Labor Relations Commission in Case No. 11-4944-83 dated 28 November 1984 and its resolution dated 16 January 1985 denying motions for reconsideration of said decision.<br><br>Eugenia C. Credo was an employee of the National Service Corporation (NASECO), a domestic corporation which provides security guards as well as messengerial, janitorial and other similar manpower services to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) and its agencies. She was first employed with NASECO as a lady guard on 18 July 1975. Through the years, she was promoted to Clerk Typist, then Personnel Clerk until she became Chief of Property and Records, on 10 March 1980.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Sometime before 7 November 1983, Credo was administratively charged by Sisinio S. Lloren, Manager of Finance and Special Project and Evaluation Department of NASECO, stemming from her non-compliance with Lloren's memorandum, dated 11 October 1983, regarding certain entry procedures in the company's Statement of Billings Adjustment. Said charges alleged that Credo "did not comply with Lloren's instructions to place some corrections/additional remarks in the Statement of Billings Adjustment; and when [Credo] was called by Lloren to his office to explain further the said instructions, [Credo] showed resentment and behaved in a scandalous manner by shouting and uttering remarks of disrespect in the presence of her co-employees."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>On 7 November 1983, Credo was called to meet Arturo L. Perez, then Acting General Manager of NASECO, to explain her side before Perez and NASECO's Committee on Personnel Affairs in connection with the administrative charges filed against her. After said meeting, on the same date, Credo was placed on "Forced Leave" status for 15 days, effective 8 November 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Before the expiration of said 15-day leave, or on 18 November 1983, Credo filed a complaint, docketed as Case No. 11-4944-83, with the Arbitration Branch, National Capital Region, Ministry of Labor and Employment, Manila, against NASECO for placing her on forced leave, without due process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Likewise, while Credo was on forced leave, or on 22 November 1983, NASECO's Committee on Personnel Affairs deliberated and evaluated a number of past acts of mis­conduct or infractions attributed to her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> As a result of this deliberation, said committee resolved:<br><blockquote><table  ="" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="5%">"1. </td><td colspan="2" valign="top">That, respondent [Credo] committed the following offenses in the Code of Disci­pline, viz:</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top" width="10%">&nbsp;</td><td width="85%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td colspan="2" valign="top"><em>OFFENSE vs. Company Interest &amp; Policies.</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">No. 3 - </td><td>Any discourteous act to customer, officer and employee of client company or officer of the Corporation.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><em>OFFENSE vs. Public Moral</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">No. 7 - </td><td><div align="justify">Exhibit marked discourtesy in the course of official duties or use of profane or insulting language to any superior officer.</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td><em>OFFENSE vs. Authority</em></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">No. 3 -</td><td> Failure to comply with any lawful order or any instructions of a superior officer."</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td valign="top">"2. </td><td><div align="justify">That, Management has already given due consideration to respondent's [Credo] scandalous actuations for several times in the past.

Notably, these offenses were those which NASECO's Committee on Personnel Affairs already resolved, on 22 November 1983 to have been committed by Credo.<br><br>In Perez's office, and in the presence of NASECO's Committee on Personnel Affairs, Credo was made to explain her side in connection with the charges filed against her; however, due to her failure to do so,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> she was handed a Notice of Termination, dated 24 November 1983, and made effective 1 December 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Hence, on 6 December 1983, Credo filed a supplemental complaint for illegal dismissal in Case No. 11-4944-83, alleging absence of just or authorized cause for her dismissal and lack of opportunity to be heard.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>After both parties had submitted their respective position papers, affidavits and other documentary evidence in support of their claims and defenses, on 9 May 1984, the labor arbiter rendered a decision: 1) dismissing Credo's complaint, and 2) directing NASECO to pay Credo separation pay equivalent to one half month's pay for every year of service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Both parties appealed to respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which, on 28 November 1984, rendered a decision: 1) directing NASECO to reinstate Credo to her former position, or substantially equivalent position with six (6) months' backwages and without loss of seniority rights and other privileges appertaining thereto, and 2) dismissing Credo's claim for attorney's fees, moral and exemplary damages. As a consequence, both parties filed their respective motions for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> which the NLRC denied in a resolution of 16 January 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Hence, the present recourse by both parties.<br><br>In G.R. No. 68970, petitioners challenge as grave abuse of discretion the dispositive portion of the 28 November 1984 decision which ordered Credo's reinstatement with backwages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Petitioners contend that in arriving at said questioned order, the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion in finding that: 1) petitioners violated the requirements mandated by law on termination, 2) petitioners failed in the burden of proving that the termination of Credo was for a valid or authorized cause, 3) the alleged infractions committed by Credo were not proven or, even if proved, could be considered to have been condoned by peti­tioners, and 4) the termination of Credo was not for a valid or authorized cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, in G.R. No. 70295, petitioner Credo challenges as grave abuse of discretion the dispositive portion of the 28 November 1984 decision which dismissed her claim for attorney's fees, moral and exemplary damages and limited her right to backwages to only six (6) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>As guidelines for employers in the exercise of their power to dismiss employees for just causes, the law provides that:<br><blockquote>"Section 2. Notice of dismissal. – Any employer who seeks to dismiss a worker shall furnish him a written notice stating the particular acts or omission constituting the grounds for his dismissal. x x x<br><br>"Section 5. Answer and Hearing. – The worker may answer the allegations stated against him in the notice of dismissal within a reasonable period from receipt of such notice. The employer shall afford the worker ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the assistance of his representative, if he so desires.<br><br>"Section 6. Decision to dismiss. – The employer shall immediately notify a worker in writing of a decision to dismiss him stating clearly the reasons therefor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></blockquote>These guidelines mandate that the employer furnish an employee sought to be dismissed two (2) written notices of dismissal before a termination of employment can be legally effected. These are the notice which apprises the employee of the particular acts or omissions for which his dismissal is sought and the subsequent notice which informs the employee of the employer's decision to dismiss him.<br><br>Likewise, a reading of the guidelines in consonance with the express provisions of law on protection to labor<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> (which encompasses the right to security of tenure) and the broader dictates of procedural due process necessarily mandate that notice of the employer's decision to dismiss an employee, with reasons therefor, can only be issued after the employer has afforded the employee concerned ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself.<br><br>In the case at bar, NASECO did not comply with these guidelines in effecting Credo's dismissal. Although she was apprised and "given the chance to explain her side" of the charges filed against her, this chance was given so perfunctorily, thus rendering illusory Credo's right to security of tenure. That Credo was not given ample opportunity to be heard and to defend herself is evident from the fact that the compliance with the injunction to apprise her of the charges filed against her and to afford her a chance to prepare for her defense was dispensed in only a day. This is not effective compliance with the legal requirements aforementioned.<br><br>The fact also that the Notice of Termination of Credo's employment (or the decision to dismiss her) was dated 24 November 1983 and made effective 1 December 1983 shows that NASECO was already bent on terminating her services when she was informed on 1 December 1983 of the charges against her, and that any hearing which NASECO thought of affording her after 24 November 1983 would merely be <i>pro forma</i> or an exercise in futility.<br><br>Besides, Credo's mere non-compliance with Loren's memorandum regarding the entry procedures in the company's Statement of Billings Adjustment did not warrant the severe penalty of dismissal. The NLRC correctly held that:<br><blockquote>"x x x, on the charge of gross discourtesy, the CPA found in its Report, dated 22 November 1983 that, 'In the process of her testimony/explanations she again exhibited a conduct unbecoming in front of NASECO Officers and argued to Mr. S. S. Lloren in a sarcastic and discourteous manner, notwithstanding, the fact that she was inside the office of the Acctg. General Manager.' Let it be noted, however, that the Report did not even describe how the socalled 'conduct unbecoming' or 'discourteous manner' was done by complainant. Anent the sarcastic' argu­ment of complainant, the purported transcript<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> of the meeting held on 7 November 1983 does not indicate any sarcasm on the part of complainant. At the most, complainant may have sounded insistent or emphatic about her work being more complete than the work of Ms. de Castro, yet, the complaining officer signed the work of Ms. de Castro and did not sign hers.<br><br>"As to the charge of insubordination, it may be conceded, albeit unclear, that complainant failed 'to place some corrections/additional remarks in the Statement of Billings Adjustments' as instructed. However, under the circumstances obtaining, where complainant strongly felt that she was being discriminated against by her supe­rior in relation to other employees, we are of the considered view and so hold, that a reprimand would have sufficed for the infraction, but certainly not termination from services.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></blockquote>As this Court has ruled:<br><blockquote>"x x x where a penalty less punitive would suffice, whatever missteps may be committed by labor ought not to be visited with a consequence so severe. It is not only because of the law's concern for the workingman. There is, in addition, his family to consider. Unemployment brings untold hardships and sorrows on those dependent on the wage-earner."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></blockquote>Of course, in justifying Credo's termination of employ­ment, NASECO claims as additional lawful causes for dismissal Credo's previous and repeated acts of insubordination, discourtesy and sarcasm towards her superior officers, alleged to have been committed from 1980 to July 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>If such acts of misconduct were indeed committed by Credo, they are deemed to have been condoned by NASECO. For instance, sometime in 1980, when Credo allegedly "reacted in a scandalous manner and raised her voice" in a discussion with NASECO's Acting head of the Personnel Administration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> no disciplinary measure was taken or meted against her. Nor was she even reprimanded when she allegedly talked "in a shouting or yelling manner" with the Acting Manager of NASECO's Building Maintenance and Services Department in 1980,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> or when she allegedly "shouted" at NASECO's Corpo­rate Auditor "in front of his subordinates displaying arrogance and unruly behavior" in 1980, or when she allegedly shouted at NASECO's Internal Control Consultant in 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> But then, in sharp contrast to NASECO's penchant for igno­ring the aforesaid acts of misconduct, when Credo committed frequent tardiness in August and September 1983, she was reprimanded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Even if the allegations of improper conduct (discour­tesy to superiors) were satisfactorily proven, NASECO's condonation thereof is gleaned from the fact that on 4 October 1983, Credo was given a salary adjustment for having performed in the job "at least [satisfactorily],"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> and she was then rated "Very Satisfactory"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> as regards job performance, particularly in terms of quality of work, quan­tity of work, dependability, cooperation, resourcefulness and attendance.<br><br>Considering that the acts or omissions for which Credo's employment was sought to be legally terminated were insufficiently proved, as to justify dismissal, reinstatement is proper. For "absent the reason which gave rise to [the employee's] separation from employment, there is no intention on the part of the employer to dismiss the employee concerned."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> And, as a result of having been wrongfully dismissed, Credo is entitled to three (3) years of backwages without deduction and qualification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>However, while Credo's dismissal was effected without procedural fairness, an award of exemplary damages in her favor can only be justified if her dismissal was effected in a wanton, fraudulent, oppressive or malevolent manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> A judicious examination of the record manifests no such conduct on the part of management. However, in view of the attendant circumstances in the case, i.e., lack of due process in effecting her dismissal, it is reasonable to award her moral damages. And, for having been compelled to litigate because of the unlawful actuations of NASECO, a reasonable award for attorney's fees in her favor is in order.<br><br>In NASECO's comment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> in G.R. No. 70295, it is belatedly argued that the NLRC has no jurisdiction to order Credo's reinstatement. NASECO claims that, as a government corporation (by virtue of its being a subsidiary of the National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC), a subsidiary wholly owned by the Philippine National Bank (PNB), which in turn is a government owned corporation), the terms and conditions of employment of its employees are governed by the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations. In support of this argument, NASECO cites National Housing Corporation vs. Juco,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> where this Court held that "There should no longer be any question at this time that employees of government-owned or controlled corporations are governed by the civil service law and civil service rules and regula­tions."<br><br>It would appear that, in the interest of justice, the holding in said case should not be given retroactive effect, that is, to cases that arose before its promulgation on 17 January 1985. To do otherwise would be oppressive to Credo and other employees similarly situated, because under the same 1973 Constitution but prior to the ruling in <i>National Housing Corporation vs. Juco,</i> this Court had recognized the applicability of the Labor Code to, and the authority of the NLRC to exercise jurisdiction over, disputes involving terms and conditions of employment in government-owned or controlled corporations, among them, the National Service Corporation (NASECO).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>Furthermore, in the matter of coverage by the civil service of government-owned or controlled corporations, the 1987 Constitution starkly varies from the 1973 Constitution, upon which <i>National Housing Corporation vs. Juco</i> is based. Under the 1973 Constitution, it was provided that:<br><blockquote>"The civil service embraces every branch, agency, subdivision, and instrumentality of the Government, including every government-owned or controlled corporation. x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></blockquote>On the other hand, the 1987 Constitution provides that:<br><blockquote>"The civil service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled corporations <i>with original charter.</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> (underlining supplied)</blockquote>Thus, the situations sought to be avoided by the 1973 Constitution and expressed by the Court in the <i>National Housing Corporation</i> case in the following manner -<br><blockquote>"The infirmity of the respondents' position lies in its permitting a circumvention or emascu­lation of Section 1, Article XII-B of the Consti­tution. It would be possible for a regular ministry of government to create a host of subsidiary corporations under the Corporation Code funded by a willing legislature. A govern­ment-owned corporation could create several subsidiary corporations. These subsidiary corpo­rations would enjoy the best of two worlds. Their officials and employees would be privileged individuals, free from the strict accountability required by the Civil Service Decree and the regulations of the Commission on Audit. Their incomes would not be subject to the competitive restraints of the open market nor to the terms and conditions of civil service employment. Conceivably, all government-owned or controlled corporations could be created, no longer by special charters, but through incorporations under the general law. The constitutional amend­ment including such corporations in the embrace of the civil service would cease to have application. Certainly, such a situation cannot be allowed to exist."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></blockquote>appear relegated to relative insignificance by the 1987 Constitutional provision that the Civil Service embraces government-owned or controlled corporations <i>with original charter;</i> and, therefore, by clear implication, the Civil Service does not include government-owned or controlled corporations which are organized as subsidiaries of government-owned or controlled corporations under the general corporation law.<br><br>The proceedings in the 1986 Constitutional Commission also shed light on the Constitutional intent and meaning in the use of the phrase "with original charter." Thus<br><br>"THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr Trenas). Commissioner Romulo is recognized<br><br>MR. ROMULO. I beg the indulgence of the Committee. I was reading the wrong provision<br><br>I refer to Section 1, subparagraph 1 which reads:<br><blockquote>The Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumenta­lities and agencies of the government, including government-owned or controlled corporations.<br><br>My query: Is Philippine Airlines covered by this provision?</blockquote>MR. FOZ. Will the Commissioner please state his previous question?<br><br>MR. ROMULO. The phrase on line 4 of Section 1, subparagraph 1, under the Civil Service Commission, says: "including government-owned or controlled corporations." Does that include a corporation, like the Philippine Air­lines which is government-owned or controlled?<br><br>MR. FOZ. I would like to throw a question to the Commissioner. Is the Philippine Airlines controlled by the government in the sense that the majority of stocks are owned by the govern­ment?<br><br>MR. ROMULO. It is owned by the GSIS. So, this is what we might call a tertiary corporation. The GSIS is owned by the government. Would this be covered because the provision says "including government-owned or controlled corporations."<br><br>MR. FOZ. The Philippine Airlines was established as a private corporation. Later on, the government, through the GSIS, acquired the controlling stocks. Is that not the correct situation?<br><br>MR. ROMULO. That is true as Commissioner Ople is about to explain. There was apparently a Supreme Court decision that destroyed that distinction between a government-owned corpora­tion created under the Corporation Law and a government-owned corporation created by its own charter.<br><blockquote>MR. FOZ. Yes, we recall the Supreme Court decision in the case of NHA vs. Juco to the effect that all government corporations irrespec­tive of the manner of creation, whether by special charter or by the private Corporation Law, are deemed to be covered by the civil service because of the wide-embracing definition made in this section of the existing 1973 Constitution. But we recall the response to the question of Commissioner Ople that our intendment in this provision is just to give a general description of the civil service. We are not here to make any declaration as to whether employees of government-owned or controlled corporations are barred from the operation of laws, such as the Labor Code of the Philippines.</blockquote>MR. ROMULO. Yes.<br><br>MR. OPLE. May I be recognized, Mr. Presi­ding Officer, since my name has been mentioned by both sides.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. I yield part of my time.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Trenas). Commissioner Ople is recognized.<br><br>MR. OPLE. In connection with the coverage of the Civil Service Law in Section 1 (1), may I volunteer some information that may be helpful both to the interpellator and to the Committee. Following the proclamation of martial law on September 21, 1972, this issue of the coverage of the Labor Code of the Philippines and of the Civil Service Law almost immediately arose. I am, in particular, referring to the period following the coming into force and effect of the Constitution of 1973, where the Article on the Civil Service was supposed to take immediate force and effect. In the case of LUZTEVECO, there was a strike at the time. This was a government-controlled and government-owned corporation. I think it was owned by the PNOC with just the minuscule private shares left. So, the Secretary of Justice at that time, Secretary Abad Santos, and myself sat down, and the result of that meeting was an opinion of the Secretary of Justice - which became binding immediately on the government - that government corporations with original charters, such as the GSIS, were covered by the Civil Service Law and corporations spun off from the GSIS, which we called secondgeneration corporations functioning as private subsidiaries, were covered by the Labor Code. Samples of such secondgeneration corporations were the Philippine Airlines, the Manila Hotel and the Hyatt. And that demarcation worked very well. In fact, all of these companies I have mentioned as examples, except for the Manila Hotel, had collective bargaining agreements. In the Philippine Airlines, there were, in fact, three collective bargaining agreements; one, for the ground people or the PALIA; one, for the flight attendants or the PASAC; and one for the pilots of the ALPAC. How then could a corporation like that be covered by the Civil Service law? But, as the Chairman of the Committee pointed out, the Supreme Court decision in the case of NHA vs. Juco unrobed the whole thing. Accordingly, the Philippine Airlines, the Manila Hotel and the Hyatt are now considered under that decision covered by the Civil Service Law. I also recall that in the emergency meeting of the Cabinet convened for this purpose at the initiative of the Chairman of the Reorganization Commission, Armand Fabella, they agreed to allow the CBAs to lapse before applying the full force and effect of the Supreme Court decision. So, we were in the awkward situation when the new government took over. I can agree with Commissioner Romulo when he said that this is a problem which I am not exactly sure we should address in the deliberations on the Civil Service Law or whether we should be content with what the Chairman said - that Section 1 (1) of the Article on the Civil Service is just a general description of the coverage of the Civil Service and no more.<br><br>Thank you, Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. Mr. Presiding Officer, for the moment, I would be satisfied if the Commit­tee puts on records that it is not their intent by this provision and the phrase "including government-owned or controlled corporations" to cover such companies as the Philippine Airlines.<br><br>MR. FOZ. Personally, that is my view. As a matter of fact, when this draft was made, my proposal was really to eliminate, to drop from the provision, the phrase "including government-owned or controlled corporations."<br><br>MR. ROMULO. Would the Committee indicate that that is the intent of this provision?<br><br>MR. MONSOD. Mr. Presiding Officer, I do not think the Committee can make such a statement in the face of an absolute exclusion of government-owned or controlled corporations. However, this does not preclude the Civil Service Law to prescribe different rules and procedures, including emoluments for employees of proprietary corporations, taking into consideration the nature of their operations. So, it is a general coverage but it does not preclude a distinction of the rules between the two types of enterprises.<br><br>MR. FOZ. In other words, it is something that should be left to the legislature to decide. As I said before, this is just a general description and we are not making any declaration whatsoever.<br><br>MR. MONSOD. Perhaps if Commissioner Romulo would like a definitive understanding of the coverage and the Gentleman wants to exclude government-owned or controlled corporations like Philippine Airlines, then the recourse is to offer an amendment as to the coverage, if the Commissioner does not accept the explanation that there could be a distinction of the rules, including salaries and emoluments.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. So as not to delay the proceedings, I will reserve my right to submit such an amendment.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Trenas).

The session is resumed.<br><br>Commissioner Romulo is recognized.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. Mr. Presiding Officer, I am amending my original proposed amendment to now read as follows: "including government-owned or controlled corporations WITH ORIGINAL CHARTERS." The purpose of this amendment is to indicate that government corporations such as the GSIS and SSS, which have original charters, fall within the ambit of the civil service. However, corporations which are subsidiaries of these chartered agencies such as the Philippine Airlines, Manila Hotel and Hyatt are excluded from the coverage of the civil service.<br><br>THE PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Trenas). What does the Committee say?<br><br>MR. FOZ. Just one question, Mr. Presiding Officer. By the term "original charters," what exactly do we mean?<br><br>MR. ROMULO. We mean that they were created by law, by an act of Congress, or by special law.<br><br>MR. FOZ. And not under the general corporation law.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. That is correct. Mr. Presiding Officer.<br><br>MR. FOZ. With that understanding and clarification, the Committee accepts the amendment.<br><br>MR. NATIVIDAD. Mr. Presiding Officer, so those created by the general corporation law are out.<br><br>MR. ROMULO. That is correct."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>On the premise that it is the 1987 Constitution that governs the instant case because it is the Constitution in place at the time of decision thereof, the NLRC has jurisdic­tion to accord relief to the parties.

No. 8, pp. 2687, 2694; also published in 78 Phil. 221) on the effectivity of the principle of social justice embodied in the 1935 Constitution, said:<br><blockquote>"Certainly, this principle of social justice in our Constitution as generously con­ceived and so tersely phrased, was not included in the fundamental law as a mere popular gesture. It was meant to (be) a vital, articulate, compelling principle of public policy. It should be observed in the interpretation not only of future legislation, but also of all laws already exist­ing on November 15, 1935. It was intended to change the spirit of our laws, present and future. Thus, all the laws which on the great historic event when the Commonwealth of the Philippines was born, were susceptible of two interpretations - strict or liberal, against or in favor of social justice, now have to be construed broadly in order to promote and achieve social justice. This may seem novel to our friends, the advocates of legalism, but it is the only way to give life and significance to the above-quoted principle of the Constitution. If it was not designed to apply to these existing laws, then it would be necessary to wait for generations until all our codes and all our statutes shall have been completely changed by removing every provision inimical to social justice, before the policy of social justice can become really effective. That would be an absurd conclusion. It is more reasonable to hold that this constitutional principle applies to all legislation in force on November 15, 1935, and all laws thereafter passed."</blockquote><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the challenged decision of the NLRC is AFFIRMED with modifications. Peti­tioners in G.R. No. 69870, who are the private respondents in G.R. No. 70295, are ordered to: 1) reinstate Eugenia C. Credo to her former position at the time of her termination, or if such reinstatement is not possible, to place her in a substantially equivalent position, with three (3) years backwages, from 1 December 1983, without qualification or deduc­tion, and without loss of seniority rights and other privi­leges appertaining thereto, and 2) pay Eugenia C. Credo P5,000.00 for moral damages and P5,000.00 for attorney's fees.<br><br>If reinstatement in any event is no longer possible because of supervening events, petitioners in G.R. No. 69870, who are the private respondents in G.R. No. 70295 are ordered to pay Eugenia C. Credo, in addition to her backwages and damages as above described, separation pay equiva­lent to one-half month's salary for every year of service, to be computed on her monthly salary at the time of her termination on 1 December 1983.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Fernan, C.J., Melencio-Herrera, Paras, Feliciano, Gancayco, Bidin, Sarmiento, Cortes, Griño-Aquino, Medialdea,</i> and <i>Regalado, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Gutierrez, Jr., J.,</i> concurs in the result.<br><i>Cruz, J.,</i> see separate concurrence.<br><i>Narvasa, J.,</i> on leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup> Signed by Guillermo C.

Excluded are its subsidiaries organized under the Corporation Code.<br><br>If that was the intention, the logical thing. I should imagine, would have been to simply say so. This would have avoided the suggestion that there are corporations with duplicate charters as distinguished from those with original charters.<br><br>All charters are <i>original</i> regardless of source unless they are <i>amended.</i> That is the acceptable distinction.
