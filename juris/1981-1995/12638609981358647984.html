and the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceeded to judgment rendered

<blockquote>In their complaint in Civil Case No. 15761, the plaintiffs alleged
that the transaction they had with defendant Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>
Rivera was not a sale but merely a mortgage; that it was made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>appear as a sale subject to the
agreement that the plaintiffs may repurchase the property within a period of
four months from the date of the sale; that of the stated consideration of
P20,000.00, the plaintiffs received only P18,000.00, the balance of P2,000.00
having been deducted by Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> Rivera by
way of usurious interest for the period of four months; that the 3-bedroom
bungalow is worth P70,000.00, while the appliances, fixtures and <span class="SpellE">furnitures</span> contained therein are worth P40,000.00; and that
the execution of the deed of sale, Exhibit A, was attended by fraud and
effected by means of misrepresentation and other forms of machinations.</blockquote>

allegations of the complaint and alleging <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

granted by the defendants the right to occupy the bungalow up to December, 1971
at a monthly rental of P250.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed the complaint for the
principal reason that the plaintiffs failed to adduce sufficient evidence to
establish in a satisfactory manner their allegation that the execution of the

forms of machinations.</blockquote>

DISCUSSED OR ARGUED IN RESPONDENTS' BRIEF.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the controversy is whether or not there was indeed a
change of theory when, in the complaint, the plaintiffs (private respondents)
prayed for the declaration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the
nullity of the Deeds of Sale (Annexes A and B, Complaint) while, on appeal,
they prayed that they be allowed to redeem the property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioners contend
that the theory of the private respondents in the court a quo is that the Deed
of Sale (Annex "A") is null and void as the same does not reflect </span>the
real transaction between the parties, their true agreement being merely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>loan, and
that the Deed of Absolute Sale was intended to hide <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>usurious transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners submit that this theory is
supported by the private respondents' prayer in their complaint that the Deed
of Sale be declared null and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Hence, the petitioners submit that a
drastic change of theory occurred when on appeal, the private respondents, in
their brief, prayed that they be allowed "to redeem the property with its
appliances worth more than P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>." The
petitioners argue that "to claim one has the right to repurchase the
property would be to (up)hold in the same instant the validity of the sale,
because if there was no valid sale in the first place, there can be no right to
repurchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The so-called right to
repurchase is not an independent right, for necessarily, it is always attached
to a valid sale."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondents counter that they did not change their theory </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contained </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, they averred that the alleged
change of theory is a mere conclusion of the petitioners not supported by the
pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, they maintain that though
it may be apparent, the claimed change of theory is not real because only the
pleadings filed and the evidence presented in the trial court were considered
on appeal; moreover, the complaint prayed "for such other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> as may be deemed just and equitable." And
then, although they did not specifically pray in their complaint that they be
allowed to redeem the property </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">question, they argue it can be
clearly inferred from their allegations that they offered to sell the property </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">petitioner Rivera with the agreement that they be given the right to
repurchase within four months from the date of sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents' position is well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no change of theory of the case on
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no surprise sprang on
the petitioners in the Court of Appeals, which surprise, after all, is the
raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span> of the prohibition against such a
change of theory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The injunction against
change of theory on appeal insures fairness in the proceedings; in other words,
fair play or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">due process bars
flip-flopping.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the case simply refers to the facts on which the
cause of action is based.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts are
those alleged in the complaint and satisfactorily proven at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the defendant believes that he can not intelligently answer,
or otherwise plead, due to some vagueness or uncertainty in the allegations of
the complaint, he can either move to dismiss<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> which is almost on all fours with the case
at bar, we stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In discussing the
first point (that "the court below decided the case against her upon a
theory different from that presented by the pleadings"), counsel insists
that the object of the fourth cause of action as set forth in the complaint,
was merely the annulment of the agreement of May 10, 1918, and did not include
the redemption from the sale with the right to repurchase, nor <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>declaration that the sale was made
for the purpose of securing a loan and, therefore, was only an equitable
mortgage.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true that paragraph (c) of the prayer of the complaint might
lead one to believe that only the annulment of the agreement in question was
sought, but examining the allegations of the body of the complaint, especially
paragraph (5) of the fourth cause of action, it will be found that facts are
stated which, if true, are sufficient to sustain the judgment of the court
below in regard to the character of the transactions between the plaintiff and
the defendant Luisa Lim, and it is a well-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">known</span> rule of pleading that the character of
the cause of action is not determined by the prayer of the complaint, but by
the facts alleged (21 R.C.L., 489; sec. 126, Code of Civil Procedure.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The allegations were also sufficient to inform the defendants of
the nature of the plaintiff's claims and to enable them to prepare their
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These requirements fulfilled,
the theories entertained by the parties become comparatively unimportant, as
far as the soundness of the judgment is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the complaint was <span class="GramE">so</span>
vague and uncertain as to leave the defendants in doubt in regard to its
meaning, timely objection should have been made by demurrer or by a motion to
make the complaint more specific.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In the instant </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">case, as correctly
pointed out by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the private
respondents, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Court of
Appeals based its decision, now assailed before us, on all the pleadings filed
and on the evidence presented in the court </span>a quo.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The complaint filed by

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That sometime in June,
1971, plaintiffs offered to sell aforesaid property to defendant Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> Rivera for Twenty Thousand (P20,000.00) Pesos
with the agreement that plaintiffs be given the right to repurchase the same
within the period of four (4) months from and after the date of sale to which
defendant agreed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That in accordance with
the agreement mentioned in the next <span class="SpellE">preceeding</span>
paragraph, defendant Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> Rivera then
prepared a document purportedly to be a sale with right to repurchase of
above-described property but included therein without the knowledge and consent
of plaintiffs all the furniture, appliances and fixtures in the said bungalow,
and by means of machinations and misrepresentations convinced plaintiffs to
sign the said document which later was discovered by plaintiffs to be a Deed of
Absolute Sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of said Deed of
Absolute Sale is hereto attached as Annex "A" and made an integral
part of this complaint.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">And then the same complaint prays, among
others, that the Deeds of Sale, Annexes "A" and "B" thereof,
be declared null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from those allegations and from the prayer all
clearly set out in the complaint, it is fair to conclude that the real purpose
in asking for the nullity of the contract of sale is to enable the private
respondents to recover or redeem the property they deeded in favor of Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> Rivera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the nature of the contract has been raised as an issue in the
pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be absurd to pray
for the nullity of an agreement and stop there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There would be a vacuum and the law, like nature, abhors a vacuum.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The private respondents'
first assignment of error (denominated grandly as "First Error of Civil
Justice") in their brief in the Court of Appeals clearly shows that they
persisted in their claim to entitlement of the right to recover, redeem, or
repurchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they interpose that
"the court a quo erred in not annulling the sale and allowing the
plaintiffs-appellants to repurchase the property in question." This
assignment can not be construed as change of theory; it is persistence, plain
and simple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not leave any
interstice in the entire theory of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consistency in the position of the private respondents runs throughout
the presentation of their advocacy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">From the foregoing, we
