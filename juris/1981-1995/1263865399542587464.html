				<H3>ANDRES E. DITAN, PETITIONER, VS. PHILIPPINE OVERSEAS EMPLOYMENT ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATOR, NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, ASIA-WORLD RECRUITMENT, INC., AND/OR INTRACO SALES CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner had the rare experience of being taken hostage in
1984, along with a number of <span style="">his </span>co-workers,
by the rebels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His captivity for more than two months and
the events that followed his release are the subject of the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Andres E. Ditan was recruited by private respondent Intraco Sales
Corporation, through its local agent, Asia World, the other private respondent,
to work in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as a welding supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract
was for nine months, at <span style="">a </span>monthly salary of US$1,100.00 or US$275.00 weekly, and
contained the required standard stipulations for the protection of our overseas
workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arriving <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="11">November 30, 1984</st1:date>, in <st1:city><st1:place>Luanda</st1:place></st1:city>,
capital of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the petitioner was assigned as an ordinary welder in the INTRACO central
maintenance shop from <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="12">December 2 to
 25, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1984</st1:date>, he was informed,
to his distress, that he would be transferred to Kafunfo, some 350 kilometers <span style="">east </span>of <st1:city><st1:place>Luanda</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the place where, earlier that year,
the rebels had attacked and kidnaped expatriate workers, killing two Filipinos
in the raid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally, Ditan <span style="">was </span>reluctant
to <span style="">go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>However, he was assured by the INTRACO
manager that Kafunfo was safe and adequately protected by government troops;
moreover - and this was more persuasive - he was told he would be sent home if
he refused the <span style="">new
</span>assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the end, with much
misgiving, he relented and agreed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1984</st1:date>,
his fears were confirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Unita
rebels attacked the diamond mining site where Ditan was working and took him
and sixteen other Filipino hostages, along with other foreign workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rebels and their captives walked through
jungle terrain for 31 days to the Unita stronghold near the Namibian
border.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They trekked for almost <span style="">a </span>thousand
kilometers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They subsisted on meager
fare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of them had diarrhea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their feet were blistered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1985</st1:date>, that the hostages were finally released
after the intercession of their governments and the International Red
Cross.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six days later, Ditan and the
other Filipino hostages were back in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The repatriated workers had been assured by INTRACO that they
would be given priority in re-employment abroad, and eventually eleven of them
were taken back. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Ditan having been
excluded, he filed in <span style="">June </span>1985
a complaint against the private respondents for breach of contract and various
other claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, he sought
the amount <span style="">of
</span>US$4,675.00, representing his salaries for the unexpired 17 weeks of his
contract; US$25,000.00 <span style="">as war </span>risk bonus; US$2,196.50 <span style="">as </span>the value of his lost belongings;
US$1,100 for unpaid vacation leave; and moral and exemplary damages <span style="">in </span>the sum
of US$50,000.00, plus attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these claims were dismissed by POEA Administrator Tomas D.
Achacoso in a decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1987</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
This was affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> by respondent NLRC in <span style="">a </span>resolution
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="7">July 14, 1987</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which is now being challenged in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going over the record, we find that the public respondent correctly
rejected the petitioner's claim for paid vacation leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The express stipulation <span style="">in </span>Clause 5 of the employment contract
reads:</p>

<blockquote>Should the Employee enter into a further 9 or 12 months contract at
the completion contract, he will be entitled to one monthâ€™s paid vacation
before commencement of his second<span style=""> </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">subsequent contract.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the petitioner had not entered into a second
contract with the employer after the expiration of the first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such re-employment <span style="">was </span>not a matter of right on the part
of the petitioner but dependent on the need for his skills in another project
the employer might later be undertaking.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the <span style="">cost </span>of
his belongings, the evidence shows that they were not really lost but in fact
returned to him by the rebels prior to their release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had other properties that were not
recovered, there <span style="">was </span>no proof of
their <span style="">loss </span>that could support
his allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were therefore
also properly rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, though, that the claims for breach of contract and war
risk bonus deserve a little more reflection in view of the peculiar
circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that stands out most prominently in the record is the <span style="">risk </span>to which the petitioner was
subjected when he was assigned, after his reluctant consent, to the
rebel-infested region of Kafunfo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was a dangerous area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This same place
had earlier been the target of a<span style=""> </span>rebel
attack that had resulted in the death of two Filipino <span style="">workers </span>and the capture of several others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Knowing all this, INTRACO still pressured
Ditan into agreeing to be transferred to that place, dismissing his initial
objection and, more important, threatening to send him home if he refused.</p>

<p class="BODY">We feel that in failing to provide for the safety of the
petitioner, the private respondents were clearly remiss in the discharge of one
of the primary duties of the <span style="">employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, </span>they not <span style="">only </span>neglected that duty but indeed
deliberately violated it by actually subjecting and <span style="">exposing Ditan </span>to <span style="">a </span>real
and demonstrated danger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not
help to argue that he was not forced to go to Kafunfo and had the option of
coming home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was a cruel choice, to
say the least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner had gone
to that foreign land in search of a better life that he could share with his
loved ones <span style="">after </span>his stint
abroad. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>That choice would have required
him to come home empty-handed to the disappointment of an expectant family.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not explained why the petitioner was not paid for the
unexpired portion of his contract which had 17 more weeks to go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hostages were immediately repatriated
after their release, presumably so they could recover from their ordeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promise of INTRACO was that they would be
given priority in re-employment should their services be needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the particular case of the petitioner, the
promise was not fulfilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would seem
that his work was terminated, and not <span style="">again
</span>required, because it was really intended all along to assign him only to
Kafunfo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents stress that the contract Ditan entered
into called for his employment in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
without indication of any particular place of assignment in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This meant he agreed to be assigned to work <u><span style="">anywhere</span></u><span style=""> </span>in that country, including Kafunfo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When INTRACO assigned Ditan to that place in
the regular course of its business, it was merely exercising its rights under
the employment contract that Ditan had freely entered into.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is argued, h<span style="">e </span>cannot now complain that there was a breach of that contract
for which he is entitled to monetary redress.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents also reject the claim for war risk bonus
and point out that POEA Memorandum Circular No. 4, issued pursuant to the
mandatory war risk coverage provision in Section 2, Rule VI, of the POEA Rules
and Regulations on Overseas Employment, categorizing Angola as a war risk took
effect only on February 6, 1985, "after the petitioner's deployment to
Angola <span style="">on </span>November 27,
1984." Consequently, the stipulation could not be applied to the
petitioner as it was not supposed to have a retroactive effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">A strict interpretation of the cold facts before us might support
the position taken by the respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, we are dealing here not with an ordinary transaction but with a
labor contract which deserves special treatment and <span style="">a </span>liberal interpretation in favor of
the worker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General
observes in his Comment supporting the petitioner, the Constitution mandates
the protection of labor and the sympathetic concern of the State for the
working class conformably to the social justice policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a command we cannot disregard in the
resolution of the case before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The paramount duty of this Court is to render justice through
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law in this case allows two
opposite interpretations, one strictly in favor of the employers and the other
liberally in favor of the worker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
choice is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find, considering
the totality of the circumstances attending this case, that the petitioner is
entitled to relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner went to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Angola</st1:place></st1:country-region>
prepared to work <span style="">as </span>he had
promised in accordance with the employment contract he had entered into in good
faith with the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over
his objection, he was sent to <span style="">a </span>dangerous
assignment and <span style="">as
</span>he feared was taken hostage in <span style="">a </span>rebel attack that prevented him from
fulfilling his contract while in captivity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon his release, he was immediately sent home and was not paid the
salary corresponding to the unexpired portion of his contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was immediately repatriated with the
promise that he would be given priority in re-employment, which never came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rub salt on the wound, many of his
co-hostages were re-employed as promised.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner was left only with a bleak experience and nothing to show
for it except dashed<span style=""> </span>hopes and a
sense <span style="">of </span>rejection.</p>

<p class="BODY">In these circumstances, the Court feels that the petitioner
should be paid the salary <span style="">corresponding
</span>to the 17 unserved weeks of his contract, which was terminated by the
private respondents despite his willingness to work out the balance of his
term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, to assuage the ordeal
he underwent while in captivity by the rebels, the Court has also decided in
its discretion to award him nominal damages in the sum <span style="">of P20</span>,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not
payment of the war risk claim which, <span style="">as
</span>earlier noted, was not provided for in the employment contract in question,
or indemnification for any loss suffered by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but <span style="">a </span>token of the tenderness of <span style="">the law towards </span>the petitioning workman <u><span style="">vis-a-vis</span></u><span style=""> </span>the private respondents and their more comfortable resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the policy of social justice, the law bends over backward
to accommodate the interests of the working class on the humane justification
that those with less privileges in life should have more privileges in
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is why our judgment today must
be for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the challenged resolution of the NLRC is hereby
MODIFIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents are
hereby DIRECTED jointly and severally to pay the petitioner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) the current equivalent in Philippine pesos
of US$4,675.00, representing his unpaid salaries for the balance of the contract
term; b) nominal damages in the amount of P20,000.00; and c) 10% attorney's <span style="">fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>No
costs.</p>
