promulgated on 24 May 1989 by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), National Capital
Judicial Region, Branch 156, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, finding Appellant
Mariano <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
guilty of violation of Section 4, Article II, R.A. No. 6425, as amended by
Section 1, P.D. No. 1675 (1980), for selling marijuana, and sentencing him
"to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>
with all its accessory penalties, to pay a fine of Twenty Thousand Pesos
(P20,000.00), and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution substantially discloses that:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On 11 August 1988, at
around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, constabulary officers of the 13th
Narcotics Regional Unit, Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, received confidential information that a
certain Mario (later identified </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mario <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> and hereinafter referred to as Appellant)
was engaged in the illicit trade of marijuana somewhere along J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> St., San Juan, Metro Manila (TSN, 15 February 1989,
p. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To verify this information,
Captain Carlos <span class="SpellE">Villafuerte</span> immediately formed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">team
composed of Sgt. Roberto Angeles, Sgt. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Raposas</span>
and Sgt. Armando Isidro as members and himself as leader (ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The team was then led by the confidential
informant to </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  11.0pt">J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> (ibid., p. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:street><st1:address>J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Sgt. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Raposas</span>
and Sgt. Armando Isidro, upon instructions, acted as lookouts (ibid.) while the
confidential informant together with Sgt. Roberto Angeles, who posed as a
buyer, approached and asked Appellant where marijuana could be bought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter inquired how much of the stuff was
needed and Sgt. Angeles replied P100.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Appellant told them to wait as he had to see if marijuana was
available (TSN, 23 November 1988, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He then left and talked to a bald man, later identified as <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> Manuel, who was standing about three (3) arms
lengths away (ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few moments
later, Mario returned, asked for money and was handed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>marked one hundred peso bill by Sgt. Angeles (TSN, 20 January
1989, p. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mario then gave the marked
money to the bald man who immediately left the place; after a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">few minutes, the bald man reappeared, handed
a transparent plastic bag to Appellant who, in turn, gave it to Sgt. Angeles
(ibid., pp. 2-3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After inspecting the
contents of the bag and determining that it contained marijuana, Sgt. Angeles
gave a pre-arranged signal to his teammates who rushed to the scene and <span class="GramE">effected</span> the arrest of Appellant (Record, Affidavit of Sgt.
Roberto Angeles, </span>p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">111, TSN, 20
January 1989, p. 5; 15 February 1989, p. 3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the bald man was able to elude the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span>
officers bringing with him the marked money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When interrogated, Appellant revealed the name of the bald man as <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> Manuel.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

officers prepared a "Receipt for Property Seized" but which Appellant
refused to sign in the space provided for "Owner of the Seized Item"
(Exhibit "B").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The confiscated
marijuana (Exhibit "D") was then indorsed the next day, August 12, to
the PC Crime Laboratory at </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Crame</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> for examination through a letter-request prepared
by the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> team (Exhibit "E").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After tests were conducted, Forensic Chemist
Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> found
and declared the subject specimen </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">positive for marijuana (Exhibit
"C").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presents another version:</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Mario <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> y <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, 25 years old, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">single, part-time worker, and residing at No. 174 Don Emilio <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>, San Juan, Metro Manila, testified that on 11
August 1988 at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was at J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street, San Juan, in front of a small store, together
with some friends when </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">group of persons </span>approached him and
inquired about a certain <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> (TSN, 14 March 1989,
p. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He responded by pointing to <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> who was standing nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Angeles then approached <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> and bought marijuana contained in a plastic bag from
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">latter (ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Brando</span> immediately
left after the sale but the group remained and later approached him again to </span>ask
where <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> resided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This time, Appellant refused to answer because, as he claimed, he was
not acquainted with the members of the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He theorizes that because of his refusal he was arrested (ibid., pp.
6-7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of his companions at J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Street and also a long time friend, Rolando Martinez,
44 years old, married, driver, and residing at No. 10, <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
Suarez Street, San Juan, Metro Manila, corroborated his testimony (ibid., pp.
1-2).</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, Appellant denies having sold the marijuana in
question, or being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>"runner"
of <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>, or having received the marked P100.00
bill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that the team dealt
directly with <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> and that he had no participation
whatsoever in their transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">After appreciation of the evidence before it, the Trial Court
rejected Appellant's version, rendered a judgment of conviction, and imposed
this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, finding the accused Mario <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
offense charged, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>hereby
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>
with all its accessory penalties, to pay a fine of twenty thousand Pesos
(20,000.00) and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hence,
this appeal.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The records show that
Appellant's original counsel, Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>,
had orally manifested to the Court that </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">accused was ready to enter a plea </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">guilty to the lesser offense under Section 8 of the Dangerous Drugs Law
(Original Record, p. 42), but apparently nothing came out of it, presumably
because of the change of lawyers due </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the illness of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span>.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant argues that
even the evidence presented by the prosecution itself supports his contention
that </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">never participated in
selling marijuana and that he was arrested by the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span>
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">officers </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">merely because of his refusal to reveal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">residence of <span class="SpellE">B<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">rando</span></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Manuel,
the actual seller </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pp.
21-22, Appellant's Brief).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">He also asserts<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>that "the prosecution witnesses
categorically stated that they are not sure that the marijuana sent to the PC
Crime Laboratory is the very same specimen they confiscated from the accused as
there are no markings made on the plastic transparent bag containing the said
marijuana before it was submitted for laboratory examination" (ibid., p.
22); and that the very testimony of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Lita</span> <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, the chemist who conducted the examination of the
marijuana specimen, reveals that there is doubt as to whether the marijuana
brought to Court is the same marijuana examined by her (ibid., pp. 22-23).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Finally, he claims that
if it were true, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">testified to by the arresting officers, that
they received information that Appellant was briskly conducting his business of
selling marijuana, then, the officers should have obtained more than just one
hundred pesos worth of marijuana and should have arrested other buyers as well
(ibid. p. 23).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We find the defense
submissions unconvincing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The evidence for the
prosecution sufficiently establishes that Appellant was caught in the act of
selling one hundred pesos (P100.00) worth of marijuana, a prohibited drug, to
Sgt. Angeles, a constabulary officer, who posed as a marijuana buyer in accordance
with the instructions of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">superior officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Angeles testified that Appellant
received the marked money from him; delivered the same to the bald man, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>; obtained marijuana in a plastic bag from the
latter, and delivered the same to Sgt. Angeles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These transactions were easily observed by the lookouts <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Raposas</span> and Armando
Isidro who, after being <span class="SpellE">signalled</span>, immediately
assisted in apprehending Appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant's stance that
when </span>he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was approached by the
team, he was immediately asked for the whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
is hardly credible considering that the only individual disclosed by the
confidential informant to the narcotics officers was "Mario." "<span class="SpellE">Brando</span>" was unknown to them as, in fact, they referred
to the latter in their testimonies </span>only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as "the bald man." In fact, it was only Mario who had
revealed the latter's name as "<span class="SpellE">Brando</span>." And
if the officers had bought directly from <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>, as
Appellant would have us believe, they would have been able to apprehend him on
the spot and he would not have been able to escape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The evidence does
establish that Appellant was a "runner", as, in fact, it took him no
time at all to contact <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> for the marijuana that
the poseur-buyer allegedly wanted to acquire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's pretense that he was arrested merely because he refused to
reveal <span class="SpellE">Brando's</span> residence to the constabulary
officers flies in the face of contrary evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">That the marked money
could not be presented as an exhibit should not detract from the prosecution
evidence, there being an obvious explanation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
- <span class="SpellE">Brando</span> had managed to escape bringing with him the
marked money.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Further, Appellant's
assertion that Sgt. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Raposas</span> and Sgt. Armando
Isidro doubted the identity </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
marijuana presented in evidence to the Court is without basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the records reveal that said
officers categorically testified that they recognized the marijuana contained
in a transparent plastic bag and presented to them in Court </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">identification as the same item which they
had confiscated from Appellant (TSN, 20 January 1989, p. 4; TSN, 15 February
1989, p. </span>4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">recognition arises from the fact that at the
time the officers arrested Appellant, Sgt. Angeles, </span>who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was then in possession of the marijuana
contained in a plastic bag, showed to them the item he had "bought"
from Appellant (ibid.); soon after, Sgt. Angeles submitted the confiscated item
to their Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span> Office where it was marked (TSN,
20 January 1989, p. 6); and, after inspection (ibid., p. 5), it was immediately
indorsed the next day to the Narcotics Investigation Section/Unit (ibid. p. 3)
which then submitted it to the PC Crime Laboratory for examination (TSN, 23
November 1988, p. 6), which agency put its own marking (TSN, 5 January 1989, p.
5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proper steps were, therefore,
sufficiently taken to safeguard the specimen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Contrary to Appellant's
contention, the testimony of the PC Crime Laboratory Chemist, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, clearly shows
that the marijuana brought to Court is the same marijuana examined by her. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>A letter-request from the Narcotics Command,
dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 11.0pt">12 August 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">
(Record, Exhibit "E", </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">p.
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">113), for the examination of
marijuana was received by the Chemistry branch of the PC Crime Laboratory (TSN,
5 January 1989, p. 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this
reque</span>s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">t, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>
received the confiscated plastic bag containing marijuana, marked and initialed
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then took random portions of the
specimen marijuana from the plastic bag for examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After tests were conducted, she reported that
the portions she examined and later threw away were, indeed, marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the rest of the plastic pack from
which samples were taken and which were submitted to the Court (ibid., p. 4)
would also be positive for marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
Court, she declared that the marijuana in a plastic bag being presented to her
for </span>identification was the same item which she received at the PC Crime
Laboratory and the contents of which she had examined as shown by the markings
thereon (ibid. p. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant's attempt to inject
doubt regarding the </span>truthfulness of the confidential information
received by the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> officers merits little
attention since the fact remains that he was caught in the act of selling
marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His role was that of a
"runner" or "broker" of <span class="SpellE">Brando</span>
Manuel, which act is covered by Section 4, Article II, R.A. No. 6425 as
amended, which punishes any unauthorized persons who would "sell,
administer, deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or
transport any prohibited drug or would act as broker of any such
transaction." The minimal amount bought by the undercover <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> officer and the fact that no other buyers from him
were apprehended are actually <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">irrelevant
considerations for the determination</span> of his guilt.</p>
