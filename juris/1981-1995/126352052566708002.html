set aside the Decision of the then Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 05901-R,
which upheld, with qualification, the Order dated September 27, 1976 of the
Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XXII, in Civil Case No. 15051.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual backdrop of the case is recited in the Decision of
the Trial Court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x on February 2, 1970 plaintiff (peti­tioner Ponciano L.
Almeda) and defendant (private respondent Alberto Figueroa) entered into a
Contract of Lease (Exh. A) wherein the 'entire ground floor except lobby' of
the Almeda Building No. 3 located at the cor­ner of Roxas Blvd. and San Luis
Street, Pasay City, was leased to the defendant for a period of five years from
March 1, 1970 at a monthly rental of P8,000.00 payable in advance on or before
the 5th day of each month; that under said contract of lease, it is stipulated
that the leased premises shall be utilized for restaurant business, operation
of coin operated machines and other allied activities; that on April 10, 1970
the plaintiff and the defendant entered into another contract of lease (Exh. C)
covering an area of 500 square meters of land at the back of Almeda Building
No. 3 for a period of ten years from April 1, 1970 'unless sooner terminated'
for a monthly rental of P2,500.00 payable in advance on or before the 5th day
of each month during the lease.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">In </span>the lease of 500 square meters of
lan<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">d, </span>it is stipulated that the
building to be constructed therein shall be used as a kitchen in the operation
of defendant's restaurant and that said building shall be built at the
exclusive expense of the defendant; that the premises consisting of the ground
of the Almeda Building No. 3 was used and still being used as a restaurant
under the tradename of 'Wells Fargo Restaurant'; that the 500 square meters of
land and the building constructed thereon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by
</span>the defendant at the expense of more than P500,000.00 is being used for
kitchen purposes and allied activities of the defendant; that the defendant due
to the inadequacy of water and air-condi­tioning system of the building was
forced to make the necessary improvement in order to remedy the inadequacy of
the water supply  and the
air-conditioning system and in doing so was forced to effect certain changes
and innovation and improvements in the premises to maintain the patronage of
the restaurant, 'Wells Fargo'; that in the construction of the said
alterations, innovations, or improvements there was no written consent given by
the plaintiff to the defendant in violation of paragraph nine (9) of the
contract (Exhs. A &amp; C) which is the law between plaintiff and
defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On August 9, 1981, petitioner filed an action for Cancel­lation
of Lease Contract with Damages against private respondent in the former Court
of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XXII, docketed as Civil Case No. 15051, on
the ground that respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">had violated
certain terms and conditions of the contract, to wit:  (1) he made improvements on the leased premises without the
written consent of petitioner; (2) he defaulted in the pay­ment of lease
rentals; (3) he failed to maintain peace and order within the vicinity of the
leased premises; and, (4) he utilized the annex building at the back of Almeda
Building No. 3 as a gambling casino.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Trial Court, with
Judge Nicanor Sison presiding, finding that the improvements, alterations or
innovations introduced by respondent at the ground floor of Almeda Building No.
3 as well as in the building constructed on the 500 square meter land were made
without the prior written consent of petitioner, and that he had defaulted in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of monthly rentals, rendered a Decision on May 13, 1975 ordering the
cancellation of the lease contracts and their Addendum, and ordered respond­ent

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1975, the Trial Court, upon petitioner's mo­tion,
ordered the execution of its judgment pending appeal.  Private respondent sought to annul said Order in a petition for <i>Certiorari</i>
filed with the Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP-04756.  Said Appellate Court dismissed the peti­tion
on February 27, 1976 and sustained the validity of the Order of execution
pending appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

failure to file appellant's Brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the Decision in CA-G.R. No. SP-04756 had attained finality,
petitioner filed in the Trial Court, a Motion for the issuance of an Alias Writ
of Execution, which after hearing, was granted on July 26, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1976, respondent Sheriff implemented the Alias Writ
and turned over to petitioner the possession of the premi­ses involved.  On August 5, 1976, private respondent filed
a Motion to allow him to enter the premises, which had been pad­locked by
respondent Sheriff, to take out several articles and personal items left inside
the building, claiming that respond­ent Sheriff implemented the Writ in a hasty
manner, which pre­vented him from taking out those articles.  Petitioner opposed the Motion, but
respondent Judge granted the same on August 16, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner moved for
reconsideration of the foregoing Order stating that he would be left without </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">any </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">security nor assurance that private respondent would pay the costs to
restore the premises to its original condition, which, according to the
architect's estimate, would amount to P331,000.00.  The Court denied reconsideration on September 7, 1976, and
authorized the special Sheriff to enforce the Order of August 16, 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On September 8, 1976,
petitioner filed an Urgent Motion to require private respondent to submit a
list of items to be withdrawn from Almeda Building No. 3 and its Annex, and for
the Court to allow only the withdrawal of those items which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">do </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

praying that an ocular inspection of the premises be made instead, </span>to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>put an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">end to the controversy </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
the nature of the things sought to be removed.  Respondent Judge conducted the ocular inspection on September 27, 1976
and issued the challenged Order on the same date, stating that the items sought
to be taken out by FIGUEROA may be easily removed from the building and,
therefore, "do not partake </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the nature </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Sheriff to withdraw the items enumerated by FIGUEROA's counsel during the ocular
inspection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner assailed the
validity of the foregoing Order in </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> filed on September 28, 1976 with the
former Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP-05901-R It </span>appears <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that on the basis of the lower Court's Order
of September 27, 1976, respondent was able to take out of the premises all the
movable items left therein, but by virtue of the filing of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>
with the then Court of Appeals and the Restraining Order issued in connection
therewith, re­spondent Sheriff was not able to remove a six-door freezer, a
centralized air-conditioning unit with two blowers, a water tank and a water
pump.  These remain as the only
controverted items.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">On </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December 27, 1976, respondent Appellate Court
affirmed the Order authorizing removal of those items but required the posting
of a bond corresponding to the cost of repairing the damage to be caused to the
leased premises by reason of such removal.  We quote the dispositive portion of respondent Court's Decision:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the order of respondent Judge dated September 27,
1976 (Annex N) is hereby upheld, subject to the qualification that before the
private respondent shall be given possession of the remaining items, to wit,
the freezers, air-conditioners, water tank and water pump, he shall be required
to put up a performance bond or some other under taking in an amount to be
ascertained by the respondent Judge, corresponding to the cost of repairing the
damage caused to the leased premises by reason of the installation and removal
of said items.  The writ of preliminary
injunction in this case shall be deemed lifted only after such undertaking or
performance bond shall have been filed and approved by respondent Judge.  There shall be no costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for reconsideration but the Appellate Court
denied the same.  Hence, this Petition
with the following errors assigned:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">"I</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent Court of Appeals erred when it granted private
respondent the right to with­draw improvements from the leased premises
introduced by private respondent in bad faith and without the written consent
of the lessor (petitioner) having been first obtained despite numerous legal
precedence enunciated by this Honorable Supreme Court in several cases
sustaining the view that improvements introduced by a lessee within the leased
premises contrary to an agreement with the lessor that prior consent must first
be obtained before such introduction cannot be removed by lessee much less is
the costs thereof reimbursed.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">II</p>

<blockquote>Moreover, even assuming that the private respondent could remove
the improvements even though he introduced the same without the prior written
consent of the petitioner, still the Honorable respondent Court of Appeals
erred in authorizing the removal of the said improvements because the same was
granted despite a clear showing that the removal of the improvements would
result in injury to the premises.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">III</p>

<blockquote>While the Honorable Court of Appeals concedes private respondent's
obligation to restore the premises to its original state and this is a
confirmation of the fact that injury to the premises would be sustained if the
re­moval is effected, the Honorable Court of Appeals erred when it merely
required the undertaking to be limited to the restoration cost occasioned by
the removal of the improve­ments selected by private respondent to the
exclusion of all other unauthorized improvements introduced within the leased
premises, the removal and the restoration cost which are substantial."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Simply put, the issues
are:  (1) whether the lessee who
introduced unauthorized improvements is entitled to remove them; (2) whether
the lessee could remove the im­provements if injury or damage would be
sustained by the leased premises; and (3) whether the lessee's undertaking
could be limited to the cost of repairing the damage caused to the leased
premises by reason of the installation and removal of the items sought to be
withdrawn.  These issues were not
litigated before the Trial Court nor were they touched upon in the questioned
Order of September 27, 1976; the Trial Court, in said Order, merely held that
the items sought to be taken </span>out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are
not permanent in nature, and hence, may be removed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Nonetheless, in the
interest of settling this controversy, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">we </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">affirm the ruling of
respondent Appellate Court upholding, with qualification, the assailed Order of
September 27, 1976.  It correctly
applied paragraph 5 of the Addendum to the Contract of Lease,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> reading:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Lessee is hereby given the right to remove all
the improvements that he may introduce in the leased premises provided the
Lessee shall restore it in the original condition, wear and tear excluded, and
provided further that should the Lessee shall fail to remove the improvements
which he may introduce there­on within a reasonable time, Lessor shall be given
the right to retain the same on the expiration of the Lease, without prejudice
to Lessor requiring Lessee to remove the same."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As observed by the
Appellate Court, private respondent is given the right to remove "<u>all</u>
improvements that he may introduce in the leased premises" without
qualifying whether the improvements contemplated are permanent or not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner contends,
however, that the above proviso should be read in conjunction with paragraph 9
of the Lease Contract requiring prior written consent of the lessor before the
lessee may introduce improvements.  Said
paragraph 9 sti­pulates:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">  </span>"NINTH - LESSEE shall not make any alterations,
improvements or additions on the leased premises without the prior written
consent of OWNER.  All such alterations,
improvements or additions made with the OWNER's consent shall upon termination
of the lease, belong to the OWNER who shall acquire all the rights thereto
without reimbursing LESSEE therefor, unless the OWNER elects to compel LESSEE
to remove them forthwith, in which event LESSEE shall undertake such removal at
his own expense, restoring the premises in the same condition in which he
received them from OWNER."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">By the very tenor of the
foregoing provision, permanent improvements are being referred to.  There would be no point to demand written
consent by the lessor prior to the installa­tion of removable improvements by
the lessee.  Of note, as found during
the ocular inspection by the Trial Court, the improvements introduced by
private respondent did not partake of the nature of permanent improvements and
could be easily removed from the building, hence, the Order authorizing their
removal.  Principally governing the controversy,
therefore, is Paragraph 5, which authorizes removal of <u>all</u> improvements
provided that the leased premises were restored to their original
condition.  The Appellate Court has
provided petitioner with the necessary safeguard by requiring the posting of a
performance bond or undertaking to that effect prior to removal.  The interests of the lessor, therefore, are
sufficiently protected.  Private
respondent-lessee, for his part, has always been willing to undertake the
necessary repairs to restore the premises to their original condition.   Necessarily and justly, too, as found by
respondent Appellate Court, those repairs should be limited to the cost of
repairing the damaged caused by reason of removal, and to restore the premises
to its original condition.  To hold
otherwise, as petitioner con­tends, would be to expand unduly the concept of
lease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">should also </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">observed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that, as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">stressed by private respondent, the premises, originally for an office
and display </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">room, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">were leased specifically for a restaurant
business and for a kitchen.  The
facilities introduced and sought to be removed, therefore, were indispensable
to keep that business going.  Petitioner-lessor should have known that those improvements had, of
necessity, to be introduced to make them suitable to the use for which the lease
was intended.  But independently of the
foregoing, and more</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> importantly,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is the finding of fact of the
Appellate Court, which is binding on us, that the con­troverted improvements
were not permanent.  Under the contract </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the parties, therefore, which is the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">law between them, those </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">improvements may be removed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
