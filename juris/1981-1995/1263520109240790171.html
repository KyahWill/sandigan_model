				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">One can understand the anxiety and frustration felt by the kin of
Yolanda H. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span> in connection with her
"disappearance." If it is of any consolation to them, it should be
mentioned that her fate is not unique. It has happened to others.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 62939 concerns a petition for habeas corpus. Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
were arrested by military authorities on <st1:date month="9" day="19" year="1982">September 19, 1982</st1:date>. First brought to a Philippine
Constabulary camp in <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
they were later transferred to the 172nd PC Company in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, where
they were seen by their relatives. On <st1:date month="9" day="20" year="1982">September
 20, 1982</st1:date>, this is what happened as stated in the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
H. <span class="SpellE">Balingit</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"That on September 20, 1982, Patrolman Santiago Rodriguez,
assigned with <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> CC, San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, appeared in the office of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">undersigned </span>together with certain
JESUS A LEJANDRINO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">y </span>Manahan and
ROGELIO TIGLAO y <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> of San Agustin, <span class="SpellE">Arayat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bulac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sta</span> Maria, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, respectively;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That said Patrolman Rodriguez together with the above-named
persons were bringing with them Affidavit manifesting that they (<span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>) were
brought to the PC Headquarters for questioning in connection with their alleged
involvement with subversive elements and that they were released from the
custody of the said PC command on the said date (Sept 20, 1982) having found
out that there was no truth in the alleged accusation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That the undersigned after examining Messrs <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> of the
veracity of what they alleged in their affidavit and having sworn to before the
undersigned the truthfulness of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
same as well as the <span class="SpellE">genuiness</span> of their signatures,
said affidavit was duly subscribed by the </span>undersigned;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That after <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
subscription of the affi­davit, Patrolman Rodriguez left the office leaving
behind Jesus <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> and after conducting some </span>inquiries to them, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they too left the office;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"That I am executing
this affidavit to prove the above-mentioned facts."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>
never returned to their respective places of abode. In a petition for habeas
corpus filed by Mrs. Luz <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span> and Mrs.
Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span>, they aver that:</p>

<blockquote>"Jesus and Rogelio would not simply dis­appear unless they are
still held incommunicado, either at 172nd PC Company or at Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, both at San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
or a <span class="SpellE">safehouse</span> known only to respondents, raising the
appre­hension that they are being tortured; or worse, they had been summarily
executed or 'salvaged' by their military custodians, in violation of their
constitutional rights."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the return to the writ, it is said that:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondents have neither information nor evidence that men
from their commands had, without authority, kidnapped <span class="SpellE">Alejandrino</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tiglao</span> after their release from custody."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition remains pending; Jesus and Rogelio are still
missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 64500 is another petition for habeas corpus. The
petition states that Joseph <span class="SpellE">Goyenechea</span> was arrested
on <st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1983">May 26, 1983</st1:date>, in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
by a PC Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ochate</span> and three other persons. Since
then Joseph has not been seen nor heard from. The petitioners ask that the body
of Joseph be produced. In their return, the respondents deny the arrest and
detention of Joseph for which reason it is said that there is no record in the <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> City INP Station of his appre­hension. The case
is still pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amnesty International in the report of its mission to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in November, 1981, mentions cases of "disappearance" which include
the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Jose Alto, a former construction worker, 'disappeared' on <st1:date month="11" day="27" year="1980">27 November 1980</st1:date> after being
abducted on his way home from the <st1:place><st1:placename>Don</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bosco</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was working. As he approached his house in <st1:street><st1:address>San
  Jose Street</st1:address></st1:street>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Metro Manila, two men accosted him, forced him
into a parked car and drove away. The abduction was witnessed by his sister, <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Alto <span class="SpellE">Aristorenas</span>, who
lives next door. She said a long-haired man wearing sunglasses, shorts and
slippers had stayed in the car and pointed out her brother to the two outside;
they had military-style haircuts and wore polo shirts, she said.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="12" day="1" year="1980">1 December 1980</st1:date>
the houses of the brother and sister were searched by a group of military men
in civilian clothes. Nothing was taken away. The mother, Priscilla Alto, who
lives in Jose Alto's house, was asked to sign a statement to the effect that
nothing had been taken, which she did.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jose Alto's <span class="GramE">family have</span> been unable
to trace him since his abduction. Between 5 and 10 December 1980 his mother
visited police stations, the head­quarters of the Philippine Constabulary, Camp
<span class="SpellE">Crame</span> (where she made contact with officials of the
Military Intelligence and Security Group (MISG) and the Cri­minal Investigation
Service (CIS)) and Camp <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Diwa</span>
(the <span class="SpellE">Bicutan</span> Rehabilitation Centre) in search of her
son. The authorities whom she approached denied all knowledge of his
whereabouts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1981">18 March 1981</st1:date>
a neighbor informed her that he had seen Jose Alto that day accompanied by two
men in civilian clothes sitting in a stationary brown Volkswagen. He had
approached and greeted Jose Alto, whereupon the car had been hurriedly driven
off.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="3" day="31" year="1981">31 March 1981</st1:date>
Priscilla Alto delivered a letter to the Ministry of National Defense
requesting assistance in trying to locate her son. She also visited the Office
of Detainee Affairs (ODA) of the Ministry of National Defense, where she
reported the sighting of the brown Volkswagen. Officials of the ODA suggested
she go to the License Division of the Land Transportation Division. There she
was told that the owner of the car could not be identified on the basis of the
incomplete number plate noted by the neighbor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant case is a petition for habeas corpus filed by Leticia
Marina and Nestor all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span>. They ask,
among other things, that the respondents be ordered to produce the body of
their sister Yolanda. The petition makes the following allegation:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.
01.</span> YOLANDA H. GORDULA was arrested without warrant or PCO on or about <st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1983">March 30, 1983</st1:date>, some­where in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
by elements of the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> Intelligence Service
Group [MISG] under the command of respondent <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.
02.</span> Upon learning of their sister's arrest, petitioners exerted efforts
to locate her. Among other steps, they visited the Constabulary Security Group
[CSG], the PC-INP Stockade, PC 12, MISG, M-2, Special Operations Group [SOG],
and the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> Investigation Unit [MIU]. At each of
these detention units petitioners were officially told that their sister
YOLANDA H. GORDULA was not detained in it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.
03.</span> Petitioners also made inquiries with the Ministry of National
Defense, the Office for Detainee Affairs and the Civilian Relations Division.
These offices neither denied nor confirmed <span class="SpellE">YOLANDA's</span>
arrest nor revealed her place of detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.
04.</span> On <st1:date month="4" day="19" year="1983">April 19, 1983</st1:date>,
petitioner Leticia H. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span> went to M-2

<blockquote>Petitioner Leticia was told that the above
numbers refer to her sister YOLANDA. She was further told that YOLANDA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was had been brought to MISG sometime in the
evening of </span><st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1983"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">April 18, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, and that YOLANDA was now detained at MISG.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"2. 05.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Petitioner Leticia then went to MISG and
requested that she be allowed to visit her sister YOLANDA. However, petitioner
Leticia was told by a secretary employed at MISG that YOLANDA was not listed </span>among
MISG records and in the MISG log book.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.
06.</span> Under the circumstances, <span class="SpellE">YOLANDA's</span>
disappearance for 20 days raises the apprehension that she is being tortured by
respondents at an undisclosed place or <span class="SpellE">safehouse</span> to
obtain statements in violation of her constitutional rights."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court issued a writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span>habeas corpus and required the res­pondents to file a return to the
petition. In their return the respond­ents ask for the dismissal of the
petition on the basis of the following disclaimer:</p>

<blockquote>"1. The person
subject of the writ, Yolanda H. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span>, is not in
the custody of the military. She has not been arrested nor detained
particularly by the elements of the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>
Intelligence Service Group (MISG) headed by respondent Col. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span>, contrary to petitioners' assertion. Proof of this
is a Certification to that effect, dated April 26, 1983, executed under oath by
Majors <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
and Jaime P. Valencia, Jr., of the Cons­tabulary Judge Advocate and of the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> Staff Judge Advocate, respectively, a true <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of which is hereto attached as Annex
"1" and made an integral part hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.
Petitioners' averment respecting the entry in the M-2's (Intelligence Unit's)
log book which reads "#1831 18-13-15/83 MISG SCR" does not refer to
the supposed arrest and detention of Yolanda H. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span>.
The same pertains to the letter-communication of petitioners dated <st1:date month="4" day="11" year="1983">April 11, 1983</st1:date>, requesting the
Honorable Minister of National Defense to locate the whereabouts of <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> subject person. Said letter which was received
on <st1:date month="4" day="12" year="1983">April 12, 1983</st1:date> was
endorsed on <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1983">April 15, 1983</st1:date>,
by the Office for Detainee Affairs, Ministry of National Defense (MND) to the
Commander, Command for the Administration of Detainee, Camp <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
(CADOC), who, on the same day, <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1983">April
 15, 1983</st1:date>, forwarded the same to the Office of <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>
Adjutant (OMA). The latter then referred the matter to the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>
Intelligence Unit (M-2), which, in turn, transmitted said letter to the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> Intelligence Service Group (MISG) on <st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1983">April 18, 1983</st1:date> at 1315 hours or <st1:time hour="13" minute="15">1:15</st1:time> p. m. It was the transmittal of aforesaid
letter and <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> which was reflected in the
M-2 Communication Journal or log book. Thus, it will be noted that as reflected
in the M-2 log book, said letter and <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> were
sent out by M-2 to the MISG on '181315' - which refers to the date and time
(April 18 1315 hours); the entry 'MISG' refers to the unit where the same was
forwarded; and 'SCR' are the initials of the MISG personnel, Susan C. Rivera,
who received the same. True <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of aforesaid
letter as well as the <span class="SpellE">indorsements</span> of MND to CADOC <span class="SpellE">CADOC</span> to OMA, and the communication journals or log books
from OMA to M-2, and M-2 to MISG, and the MISG Communication Journal, are
hereto attached as Annexes "2", "3", "4",
"5", "6" and "7", respectively, and made integral
parts hereof. Clearly, said log book referred to by petitioners pertains to
communications received and not to persons detained;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The traverse and the reply thereto have not elicited any solid
fact except the circumstance that Yolanda was with Dr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>
in the evening of <st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1983">March 30, 1983</st1:date>.
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span> said to be an NPA "<span class="SpellE">Kumander</span>" was shot dead by a <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span>

  City</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1983">April
 1, 1983</st1:date>. And the question remains: where is Yolanda?</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the respondents have persistently denied having
Yolanda H. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span> in their custody and absent
convincing proof to rebut their denial, the Court is constrained to dismiss the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writer has received a letter from Mrs. Lolita <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span> who lives in <st1:place><st1:city>Virginia Beach</st1:city>,

Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gordula</span>, who is Yolanda's mother, asks that the
case be decided.</p>

I commiserate with you but this is the best that can be done under the
