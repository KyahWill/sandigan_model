The limited character of this Court's <em>certiorari </em>jurisdiction 
concerning any "decision, order, or ruling of the Commission [on 
Elections]" turns out to be an insuperable obstacle to the granting of 
this petition.
<p>
The statement of the case as set forth in the decision sought to be 
reviewed follows: "This petition seeks the disqualification of 
respondents Jose Guyguyon, Ricardo Sakai, Pascual Bulayungan, Dominga 
Bilibli and Paulina Bulahao as candidates for the positions of Mayor, 
Vice-Mayor and Members of Sangguniang Bayan, respectively, in the 
Municipality of Kiangan, Province of Ifugao, in the January 30, 1980 
local election on the ground of turncoatism.  The respondents were 
official candidates of the Nacionalista Party (NP) in the aforesaid 
election.  On January 25, 1980, the petitioner filed the instant 
petition.  But before the resolution thereof by this Commission, the 
local election was held on January 30, 1980 and the respondents garnered
 the majority of the votes cast for the positions for which they 
respectively ran.  Subsequently, the respondents were proclaimed by the 
Kiangan Board of Canvassers, 'without prejudice, however, to the hearing
 and ruling hereafter* * * involving the question of respondents' 
disqualification,' pursuant to Item No. 9309 of the Minutes of the 
Session of the Commission held on February 26, 1980.  On February 16, 
1981, the parties submitted the case for resolution upon filing of their
 respective memoranda.  During the hearing on said date, the counsel for
 respondents informed this Commission about the recent death of 
respondent Bulahao."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
Then came the finding of facts:  "Considering, appreciating and 
evaluating the pleadings filed by parties, the evidence and memoranda 
submitted by them and their submissions, We find the following facts 
duly established:  On November 26, 1979, an organiÂ­zational meeting of 
the KBL precinct and barangay committees was held in Kiangan, Ifugao.  
Respondent Guyguyon, who at that time was an Adult Education Supervisor 
under the Ministry of Education and Culture, upon invitation of Jose 
Bait, Bureau of Agricultural Extension Provincial Officer, attended said
 meeting.  On the precinct level, he was elected Chairman of Precinct 
No. 27, and on the barangay level, he was elected Barangay Committeeman.
  He was not then aware that the meeting was a KBL organizational 
meeting and he was then of the impression that said meeting was only for
 the purpose of organizing committees that will conduct an information 
drive in connection with a referendum that may be held in the future.  
The next day, upon learning that the meeting was a KBL organizational 
meeting, he immediately wrote a letter (Exhibit 1) to Barangay Chairman 
Eduardo Sakai, declining his nomination as KBL Chairman of Precinct No. 
27, in view of his being in the government service as Adult Education 
Supervisor under the Ministry of Education and Culture.  The latter 
acknowledged receipt of said letter and expressed his regret for 
respondent Guyguyon's not joining the KBL party (Exhibit 2).  Prior to 
the meeting on November 26, 1979, he was not a member of any political 
party.  On an unspecified date, respondent Bulayungan, upon invitation 
of Glory Dait, wife of the above-named Jose Dait, attended a meeting for
 the purpose of electing a Chairman of Precinct No. 17 for some future 
purpose that would effectuate the parliamentary system down to the grass
 roots level.  Those who attended that meeting were not required to make
 known their political party affiliations.  Respondent Bulayungan was 
elected Chairman of Precinct No. 17 during said meeting.  Like 
respondent Guyguyon, he also attended the KBL organizational meeting on 
November 26, 1979 and was elected Barangay Committeeman.  On November 
27, 1979, an organizational meeting of the KBL municipal committee of 
Kiangan was held.  Respondents Sakai, Bilibli and Bulahao, in their 
capacity as Sangguniang Bayan Members, attended said meeting, in 
compliance with a written notice from then Mayor Julian Dulawan 
requiring all Sangguniang Bayan Members to attend.  They were not 
informed about the nature of said meeting.  Upon request of Mayor 
Dulawan, respondent Sakai presided over the meeting.  He inquired from 
the Mayor what the meeting was about and the latter replied that it was 
for a movement of the KBL to inform the people of a possible election or
 referendum that may be held in the near future."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
This finding in the decision under review was considered by respondent 
Commission decisive:  "In all the aforementioned meetings, the 
respondents did not take an oath of affiliation as members of the KBL.  
They have been long standing NP members prior to said meetings, except 
respondent Guyguyon who was not then a member of any political party."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
The petition as well as the Reply stressed strongly what it termed the 
arbitrary character of the decision under review.  From a study of the 
record as well as of the Comment of Solicitor General, Estelito P. 
Mendoza,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  it cannot be said that such a charge was warranted.  The petition must fail.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  Petitioner in seeking a reversal apparently relied on the 
authoritative doctrine of this Court last given expression in Sidro v. 
Commission on Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> in 
these words: "Thus it was in the first leading case on the matter under 
the 1935 Constitution, Sotto v. Commission on Elections.  The opinion of
 Justice Feria, after setting forth the applicable constitutional 
provisions and the Rules of Court, stated:  'In accordance with the 
provision of section 9 of Commonwealth Act No. 657, this Court can not, 
therefore, review the rulings or findings of fact of the Commission on 
Elections.' A caveat is in order.  Such rulings or findings of fact of 
the Commission on Elections must be lacking in arbitrariness to be 
conclusive on this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 2.  The above doctrine, of course, is only applicable under facts 
that would show arbitrariness.  As is quite manifest from a reading of 
the Comment of the Solicitor General, the decision certainly was not 
tainted by arbitrariness.  To that extent, it is free from the infirmity
 of lack of due process.  As was stressed in such Comment, it was 
supported by substantial evidence.  Thus: "Private respondents testified
 that, although they admittedly attended certain meetings of the KBL, 
they did so on the belief that these were intended for the organization 
of civic committees that would disseminate information regarding future 
plebiscites and elections.  There is no reason to think otherwise.  
Respondents Guyguyon, et al. did not perform any affirmative act clearly
 establishing their affiliation with the KBL as bona fide members.  
There is no evidence that they applied for membership or were conferred 
such status by the appropriate authority in that political party.  When 
they attended the meetings in question, they were not required to 
establish their credentials.  Section 1, article 1 of the Rules of the 
KBL provides in part that 'Membership is conferred by a majority vote of
 the Municipal or City Committee or the Central Committee, and is 
evidenced by a certificate of affiliation issued by the Secretary 
General of the Party.' There is no evidence that the committees 
mentioned conferred membership upon any of the private respondents or 
that the latter have been issued certificates of affiliation by the 
Secretary General of the KBL."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 The probabilities as set forth in the Comment are against the 
contention of petitioner.  Thus: "Moreover, it is not likely that civil 
service employees like respondent Guyguyon and the others with him would
 have attended and participated in the meetings in question if they knew
 that these had a political complexion.  Indeed, the evidence shows that
 immediately upon learning that it was to the position of KBL chairman 
of Precinct No. 27 that he was elected, respondent Guyguyon wrote the 
barangay captain declining said position on the ground that he was 
barred from accepting it, being a civil service employee."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  Then the Comment proceeded to demonstrate that the Gabatan doctrine,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
 cited in support of the petition, can readily be distinguished.  Thus: 
"In that case, both Gabatan and Trinidad attended the convention of the 
KBL held on December 20, 1979 at Pagsanjan, Laguna.  They were nominated
 to run for the positions of mayor and vice-mayor, respectively, of 
Pagsanjan and they accepted the nomination.  Gabatan even attested the 
minutes of the meeting in his capacity as Chairman of the KBL, Pagsanjan
 Chapter.  In concluding that Gabatan and Trinidad were members of the 
KBL, the Comelec found that the circumstances indicate that they were 
completely aware that the KBL meeting or convention was intended to 
choose the KBL candidate in the forthcoming election.  The present case 
differs from the case of Gabatan because here the evidence shows that 
private respondents were not aware that the meetings they attended were 
KBL organizational meetings.  In the Gabatan case, the convention 
precisely chose the KBL candidates for the local election whereas, here,
 there was no clear political act done by those who attended the Kiangan
 meetings.  The organization of the barangay and precinct level 
committees of the KBL could have, at least in appearance, passed for the
 kind of meetings which the private respondents claimed they attended.  
Petitioner makes capital of the fact that the names of respondents 
Guyguyon and Bulayungan appeared on the list of those elected to serve 
in the precinct and barangay committees submitted by the Barangay 
Captain to the governing bodies of the KBL.  But this list can not be 
considered binding on respondents Guyguyon and Bulayungan who do not 
appear to have participated in the preparation of the list."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Reyes v. Commission on Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  was cited.  The prohibited change of party affiliations by an elective
 official during his term of office and by a candidate for such office 
within six months immediately preceding or following an election was 
characterized in such decision as both innovative and mandatory.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  Once the fact of turncoatism - as the practice became popularly known -
 had been shown, the disqualification becomes unavoidable.  Nothing said
 in Reyes, however, or in subsequent cases for that matter, can be so 
interpreted as to call for the application of such provision unless 
there be clear and satisfactory proof of either the elective officer or 
the candidate for an elective public office having committed the 
prohibited act.  As in ordinary litigation, it is the trier of facts 
that is vested with broad discretionary authority in the appraisal of 
the evidence offered.  In election controversies, where disqualification
 is an issue prior to the election, as did happen in this case, although
 the actual trial took place after the election, it is the respondent 
Commission.  As shown in the preceding pages, it held after a careful 
study of the evidence of record that there was no cause for 
disqualification based on turncoatism.  There being then no taint of 
arbitrariness in the conclusion arrived at, its finding, being supported
 by substantial evidence, is entitled to be accorded full respect.
