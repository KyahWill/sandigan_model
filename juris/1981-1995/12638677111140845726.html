				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Under the Industrial Peace Act,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
government-owned or controlled corporations had the duty to bargain
collectively and were otherwise subject to the obligations and duties of
employers in the private sector.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The Act also prohibited <i style="">supervisors</i><span style=""> </span>to become, or continue to be,
members of labor organizations composed of rank­-and-file employees,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and prescribed criminal sanctions for breach of the prohibition.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was under the regime of said Industrial Peace Act that the
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS, for short) became bound by a
collective bargaining agreement executed between it and the labor organization
representing the majority of its employees, the GSIS Employees
Association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement contained a "maintenance-of-membership"
clause,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e., that all employees who, at the time of the execution of said agreement,
were members of the <span style="">union or </span>became
members thereafter, were obliged to maintain their union membership in good
standing for the duration of the agreement as a condition for their continued
employment in the GSIS.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no dispute that at that time, the petitioners
occupied supervisory positions in the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Arizala</span> and Sergio <span class="SpellE">Maribao</span>
were, respectively, the Chief of the Accounting Division, and the Chief of the
Billing Section of said Division, in the Central <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span>
Regional Office of the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> and <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulandus</span> were, respectively, the Assistant Chief of the
Accounting Division (sometimes Acting Chief in the absence of the Chief) and
the Assistant Chief of the Field Service and Non-Life Insurance Division (and
Acting Division Chief in the absence of the Chief), of the same Central <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> Regional Office of the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Demands were made on all four of them to
resign from the GSIS Employees Association, in view of their supervisory
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They refused to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, two (2) criminal cases for
violation of the Industrial Peace Act were lodged against them in the City
Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one involving <span class="SpellE">Arizala</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maribao</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the other, <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bulandus</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both criminal actions resulted in the conviction of the accused
in separate decisions.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
They were each sentenced "to pay a fine of P500.00 or to suffer subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency." They appealed to the Court of
Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Arizala's</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maribao's</span>
appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. No. 14724-CR; that of <span class="SpellE">Joven</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bulandus</span>, as CA-G.R. No. 14856-CR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeals were consolidated on motion of the appellants, and
eventuated in a judgment promulgated on <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1976</st1:date> affirming the convictions of all four appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants moved for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argued that when
the so called "1973 Constitution" took effect on January 17, 1973
pursuant to Proclamation No. 1104, the case of <span class="SpellE">Arizala</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Maribao</span> was still pending in the Court of Appeals
and that of <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bulandus</span>,
pending decision in the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>; that
since the provisions <span style="">of that
constitution -- and of the Labor Code subsequently promulgated (<span class="SpellE">eff</span>., November 1, 1974), repealing the Industrial Peace Act
-- placed employees of all categories in government-owned or controlled
corporations without distinction within the Civil Service, and provided that
the terms and conditions of their employment were to be "governed by the
Civil Service Law, rules and regulations" and hence, no longer subject of
collective bargaining, the appellants ceased to fall within the coverage of the
Industrial Peace Act and should thus no longer continue to be prosecuted and
exposed to punishment for a violation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They pointed out further that the criminal sanction in the Industrial
Peace Act no longer appeared in the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Appellate Court denied their plea for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue obviously is whether or not the petitioners'
criminal liability for a violation of the Industrial Peace Act may be deemed to
have been obliterated in virtue of subsequent legislation and the provisions of
the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' contention that their liability had been erased
is made to rest upon the following premises:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Article XII-B
of the 1973 Constitution does indeed provide that the "Civil Service
embraces every branch, agency, subdivision and instrumentality of the
government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, **
administered by an independent Civil Service Commission."</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 292 of the Labor
Code repealed such parts and provisions of the Industrial Peace Act as were
"not adopted as part" of said Code "either directly or by
reference." The Code did not adopt the provision of the Industrial Peace
Act conferring on employees of government- owned or controlled corporations the
right of self-organization and collective bargaining; in fact it made known
that the "terms and conditions of employment of all government employees,
including employees of government-owned and controlled corporations,"
would thenceforth no longer be fixed by collective bargaining but "be
governed by the Civil Service Law, rules and regulations."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The specific penalty for
violation of the prohibition on supervisors being members in a labor
organization of employees under their supervision has disappeared.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Code also modified
the concept of unfair labor practice, decreeing that thenceforth, "it
shall be considered merely as an administrative offense rather than a criminal
offense (and that) (u)<span class="SpellE">nfair</span> labor practice complaints
shall ** be processed like any ordinary labor disputes.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in justification of the Appellate Tribunal's <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the petitioners' convictions of violations of
the Industrial Peace Act, the People <span style="">-?</span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>advert to the fact that
said Labor Code also states that "all actions or claims accruing prior to
** (its) <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> ** shall be determined in
accordance with the laws in force at the time of their accrual;" and</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>argue that the
legislature cannot generally intervene and vacate the judgment of the courts,
either directly or indirectly, by the repeal of the statute under which said
judgment has been rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal principles governing the rights of self-organization
and collective bargaining of rank-and-file employees in the government --
particularly as regards <i style=""><span style="">supervisory</span></i><span style="">, </span>and <i style=""><span style="">high</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">level</span></i><span style=""> </span>or <i style=""><span style="">managerial</span></i><span style=""> </span>employees

for the purpose of securing changes or modification in their terms and

collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">Supervisory employees</i><span style=""> </span>were forbidden to join labor

the <span style="">proclamation of martial law in
September, 1972, was General Orders No. 5 which <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The reason for denying to government
employees the right to "self-organization and to form, join or assist
labor organizations for purposes of collective bargaining" is presumably
the same as that under the Industrial Peace Act, i.e., that the terms and
conditions of government employment are fixed by law and not by collective
bargaining.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some inconsistency appears to have arisen between the Labor Code
and the Civil Service Act of 1959.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the Civil Service Act, persons "employed in proprietary functions of the
government including, but not limited to, governmental corporations" --
not being within "the policy of the Government that the employees therein
shall not strike for the purpose of securing changes in their terms and
conditions of employment" -- could legitimately bargain with their
respective employers through their labor organizations, and <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>
engage in strikes and other concerted activities in an attempt to bring about
changes in the conditions of their work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could not however do so under the Labor Code and its Implementing
Rules and Regulations; these provided that "government employees,
including employees of government-owned and/or controlled corporations,"
without distinction as to function, were "exempted" (excluded is the
better term) from "the right to self-organization and to form, join or
assist labor organizations for purposes of collective bargaining," and by
implication, excluded as well from the right to engage in concerted activities,
such as strikes, as coercive measures against their employers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">Members of supervisory</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">unions</i><span style=""> </span>who were not managerial employees,
were declared by the Labor Code to be ''eligible to join or assist the rank and
file labor organization, and if none exists, to form or assist in the forming
of such rank and file organization."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>

the attainment of their objectives, such as strikes, picketing, boycotts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the right of government employees to
"form, join or assist employees organizations of their own choosing"

<p class="NUM">1. The petitioners contend that the right of self-organization and
collective bargaining had been withdrawn by the Labor Code from government
employees -- including those in government?owned and controlled
corporations -- chiefly for the reason that the terms and conditions of
government employment, all embraced in civil service, may not be modified by
collective bargaining because set by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore immaterial, they say, whether supervisors are members of
rank-and-file unions or not; after all, the possibility of the employer's
control of the members of the union thru supervisors thus rendering collective
bargaining illusory, which is the main reason for the prohibition, is no longer
of any consequence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was true, for a time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already discussed, both under the Labor Code and PD 807, government
employees, including those in government-owned or controlled corporations, were
indeed precluded from bargaining as regards terms and conditions of employment
because these were set by law and hence could not possibly be altered by
negotiation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But EO 111 restored the right to organize and to negotiate and
bargain of employees of "government corporations established under the
Corporation Code." And EO 180, and apparently RA 6715, too, granted to all
government employees the right of collective bargaining or negotiation except
as regards those terms of their employment which were fixed by law; and as to
said terms fixed by law, they were prohibited to strike to obtain changes
thereof.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The petitioners appear to be correct in their view of the
disappearance from the law of the prohibition on supervisors being members of
labor organizations composed of employees under their supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Code (PD 442) allowed supervisors
(if not managerial) to join rank-and-file unions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And under the Implementing Rules of RA 6715,
supervisors who were members of existing labor organizations on the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of said RA 6715 were explicitly authorized to
"remain therein."</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The correctness of the petitioners' theory that unfair labor
practices ceased to be crimes and were deemed merely administrative offenses in
virtue of the Labor Code, cannot be gainsaid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 250 of the Labor Code did provide as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 250. <i style="">Concept of
unfair labor practice</i><span style="">. - </span>The
concept of unfair labor practice is hereby modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Henceforth, it shall be considered merely as
an administrative offense rather than a criminal offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfair labor practice complaints shall,
therefore, be processed like any ordinary labor disputes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But unfair labor practices were declared to be crimes again by
later amendments of the Labor Code effected by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 70, approved on <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
thus amended, the Code now pertinently reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 248.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style="">Concept of unfair labor practice and
procedure for prosecution thereof.</i><span style="">
- </span>Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of workers and
employees to self organization, are inimical to the legitimate interests of
both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and
otherwise deal with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual respect,
disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion of healthy and stable
labor-management relations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Consequently, unfair labor practices are not only violations of the
civil rights of both labor and management but are also criminal offenses
against the State which shall be subject to prosecution and <span style="">punishment as herein provided.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>***<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>***<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>***</blockquote>

<blockquote>Recovery of civil liability in the administrative proceedings shall
bar recovery under the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No criminal prosecution under this title may be instituted without
a final judgment, finding that an unfair labor practice was committed having
been first obtained in the preceding paragraph. * * * . "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decisive consideration is that at present, supervisors who
were already members of a rank-and-file labor organization at the time of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of R.A. No. 6715, are authorized to
"remain therein." It seems plain, in other words, that the
maintenance by supervisors of membership in a rank-and-file labor organization
even after the enactment of a statute imposing a prohibition on such
membership, is not only not a crime, but is explicitly allowed, under present
law.</p>

where the appellants had appealed from a judgment convicting them of a
violation of a municipal ordinance, and while their appeal was pending, the
ordinance was repealed such that the act complained of ceased to be a criminal
act but became legal, this Court dismissed the criminal proceedings,
pronouncing the effects of the repeal to be as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the leading case of the <i style=""><span style="">United States vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Cuna</span></i> (12 Phil. 241), and <i style=""><span style="">Wing vs. United States</span></i><span style=""> </span>(218 <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
272), the doctrine was clearly established that in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
repeal of a criminal act by its reenactment, even without a saving clause would
not destroy criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not
a single sentence in either decision indicates that there was any desire to
hold that a person could be prosecuted, convicted, and punished for acts no
longer criminal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no question that at common law and in <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
a much more favorable attitude towards the accused exists relative to statutes
that have been repealed than has been adopted here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our rule is more in conformity with the
Spanish doctrine, but even in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
where the offense ceased to be criminal, prosecution cannot be had (1 Pacheco,
Commentaries, 296).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The repeal here was absolute, and not a reenactment and repeal by
implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor was there any saving
clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislative intent as shown
by the action of the municipal council is that such conduct, formerly
denounced, is no longer deemed criminal, and it would be illogical for this
court to attempt to sentence appellant for the offense that no longer exists.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are therefore of the opinion that the proceedings against
appellant must be dismissed."</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The legislative intent not to punish anymore the tenant's act of

the fact that, as already noted, the Code of Agrarian Reforms did not reenact
