<blockquote>"According to the complainant <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
Abraham, she is a native of <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, but she taught in <st1:place><st1:placename>Juan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sumulong</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary
  School</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.
On <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1970</st1:date> she
went to the house of the accused in <span class="SpellE">Guinhawa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Batangas</span></span>
for a brief vacation. She was accompanied by her mother, an aunt, a teenage
girl and a small boy. She knew the accused very well because he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>her <span class="SpellE">compadre</span>,
she being the godmother of the youngest child of the accused. The following
day, Nov. 3, her mother, aunt and the teenage girl left <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span>
for <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, so
that only the small boy was left with her in the house of the accused. About <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of November 3 she was suddenly awakened
because someone <span class="GramE">laid</span> beside her. Upon opening her eyes
she recognized the intruder to be her <span class="SpellE">compadre</span> the
herein accused. Suddenly, he kissed her on the lips. She pushed him and tried
to free herself from his hold. At this juncture, the accused threatened to kill
her if she causes an alarm. Thereafter the accused started to kiss her again
but she tried her best to evade his kisses. Notwithstanding the threat of the
accused, complainant shouted and called for the wife of the accused who, upon
being awakened, admonished her husband saying 'Why? Are you not ashamed to do
this to our <span class="SpellE">comadre</span>?’ Instead of making a reply, the
accused stood up and started to maltreat his wife. This naturally caused a
commotion and all the children of the accused were awakened. Even the mother of
the accused who was at the ground floor was disturbed in her sleep and she
called for the accused. The latter however arrogantly shouted back and told her
not to interfere. Several other persons arrived but they were met by the
accused who told them, '<span class="SpellE">Huwag</span> <span class="SpellE">kayong</span>
<span class="SpellE">makikialam</span>.' The complainant finally decided to go to
the street believing it to be a safer place for her. While there, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">she </span>met a certain Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> who invited her to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">his </span>house. She readily agreed. She was joined by the two
children of the herein accused. In the house of Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span>
she was given water and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>told
by the wife of Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> that she should take a
rest. The wife of Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> also informed her that
the companions of the accused in the house were all <span class="GramE">crying</span>.
Much later, Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> informed her that the accused
was no longer in the house and upon suggestion of the former she agreed to go
to the house of the accused to fetch the small boy whom she left in the house. On
the way she noticed the accused approaching them. When already near each other
the accused tried to hold her again but she tried to evade him by going around
Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> whom she asked to help her. Her request
for help seemed to fall on deaf ears because she noticed that Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> did nothing. Finally the accused caught her hands
and because she lost her balance she fell to the ground. As she was trying to
stand while shouting, the accused gave her fist blows. Then the accused dragged
her. She again resisted. For making the situation hard for the accused, the
latter gave her more fist blows and again dragged her. When they reached in
front of the house of the brother of the accused, she shouted for help. For
doing so, she received more fist blows, one of which landed on her stomach and
she became unconscious. When she regained her consciousness she realized that she
was in the cane field with the accused on top of her and having sexual intercourse
with her. She struggled to free herself but the accused gave her fist blows in
the thigh. The accused did not release her until he had fully consummated his
bestial lust. Then the accused advised her to put on her jeans. She tried to
stand but realized that she was too weak to do so. She also felt pains all over
her body. In such condition, the accused brought her to his house, advising her
however that she should not create any scandal otherwise, he will kill her. Once
in the house of the accused the wife of the accused attended to her up to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"> </span>November 5. The whole day of November
4, she was feverish and suffering from pains in her body. The following day,
November 5, she went to <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
accompanied by the wife of the accused. She had not informed anyone, including
the wife of the accused, about her harrowing experience in the cane field. Her <span class="GramE">reasons for the silence, according to her, was</span> that she had
to deliberate carefully what course of action to take. She could not immediately
confide the matter to her mother because she was suffering from heart ailment. She
was also afraid of the possible drastic action her father and brothers might
do. Thus according to the complainant, it was only when her mother went to
Manila and told her not to be afraid to confide her troubles to her that she
decided to reveal the truth. Hence, on November 12, she went to the P.C. and
executed her affidavit. <span class="GramE">xxx</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He had known <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> for the past
three years. He met her for the first time when he went to <span class="SpellE">Manghinaw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bauan</span> to look for a job. The father of <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>, a contractor of gravel and sand requested him to
stay in his house. <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> was then staying in the
said house of her father. She was then jobless but schooling in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>. On numerous occasions <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
rode the truck he was driving because he used to bring sand to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>. After graduation, she taught in <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>. On several occasions, he also took <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> to school where she was teaching. Then <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> was transferred to another school and as before, he
used to take her there. This friendship developed into love and soon thereafter
they became sweethearts. <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> must have been so
much in love with him because she even approached him while in bed. Hence,
their relationship became more intimate and they cohabited as husband and wife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The first time <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> went to his
house in <span class="SpellE">Tuy</span> was during a barrio fiesta in 1968. Thereafter
she occasionally visited his place. On <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1970</st1:date> he found <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>, the mother, an
aunt and a boy in his house upon his arrival. That evening they slept in his
house. The following day <span class="SpellE">Perlita's</span> companions left
except the boy. On November 3 <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> slept in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> as per their agreement so they could have an
opportunity to be together, they being sweethearts. That evening of November 3
he came from a mahjong game and when he was on his way to their room to see if
his wife was asleep, <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> tripped him and said
that his wife was already asleep. So he <span class="GramE">laid</span> beside
her and had carnal knowledge of her. As they were having intercourse, his wife
came out of the room with a club and started to hit him and <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>.
In the course of the attack, <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> fell down the
stairs and they left the house and went to a side of a river. <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> suggested that they leave the barrio but on second
thought, they realized that he was only wearing his undershirt and shorts,
while <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> only her T-shirt without anything underneath.
They went back to the house and against the protest of his <span class="GramE">wife,</span>
he managed to get some clothes which a child of his gave to <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>,
while he was holding his wife.</blockquote>

file a case against them. However, his wife rejected the proposal of <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> that she live with them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The defendant-appellant
made the following assignments of errors in his appeal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN BELIEVING THE VERSION OF<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>THE PROSECUTION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING DEFENDANT-APPELLANT GUILTY OF THE
CRIMES OF ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS AND RAPE.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant begged leave to discuss the above assigned errors
together in one joint argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contentions hinge on credibility of witnesses. We
have gone carefully over the records especially on the points stressed by the
appellant but find no reason to depart from the general rule of according
respect to the findings of the trial court on the credibility of the persons
who testified before it. (See People v. Santos, L-60055, April 28, 1983; People
v. Mercado, 97 SCRA 232) The lower court did not overlook any facts of
substance and value which, if considered, might have affected the result of the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">That there was sexual intercourse is established. The appellant
claims that he and <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> had sex on various
occasions with her consent. The incident on November 3 when the appellant's
wife allegedly caught them was, according to the appellant, the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">fifth</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt"> </span>sexual intercourse between them. Dr. <span class="SpellE">Aguado</span>,
the medico legal officer of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
testified, on the other hand, that the <u>five</u> lacerations of Miss
Abraham's hymen could have been sustained in only one sexual intercourse and it
was possible for these lacerations to have been sustained between <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of November 3 and early morning of <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incidents happened shortly before <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> and on the early morning of November 4. The
medical examination was conducted on November 12 or eight days later. It is
significant that in addition to the lacerations of the hymen in five different
places, the complainant still bore signs of multiple abrasions in the left
scapular region, similar abrasions in the left forearm, multiple abrasions
above the neck's <span class="SpellE">sternal</span> notch, multiple abrasions in
the right iliac region, and <span class="SpellE">hematomas</span> in four
separate parts of the left arm and left thigh. The injuries are clearly more
compatible with the violent attacks of a rapist than the alleged beatings of an
aggrieved wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant argues that if the victim was raped she should not
have returned to his house. The records show that at this point there was no
rape yet. After being subjected to acts of lasciviousness, <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
fled to the street. It was then almost midnight. A certain Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> aroused by the commotion, the <span class="SpellE">shoutings</span>,
and the crying of children invited <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> to his
house. Later on, Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span> told her that the
appellant was no longer around or in his house and that she should fetch the
small boy, her only companion in the appellant's barrio, who was crying. On her
way she met the accused who dragged her while Ka <span class="SpellE">Pendong</span>
did nothing. Only then was rape committed. She returned to the house to fetch
her boy companion, thinking that after the outcry and commotion <span class="SpellE">Gamez</span> had fled and it was already safe.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant asks why <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> left his
house only the day after the alleged rape. He states that if <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> was raped, she should not have allowed his wife to
escort her to <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the complainant was aching all over after
the rape in the cane field. She was so weak she could not even stand up to put
on her jeans. She had been given repeated fist blows, until she became
unconscious from a blow in the stomach. It was the appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who </span>brought her up to his house,
telling her that if she created a scandal he would kill her.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to why she did not go home to <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>
immediately but waited until the following morning, the complainant stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now

<p class="BODY">The wife of appellant <span class="SpellE">Gamez</span> accompanied
the complainant because of the latter's condition. Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gamez</span>
had run to <span class="SpellE">Perlita's</span> help when the appellant lay down
beside her and committed the lascivious acts. For her trouble, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Gamez</span> was beaten up by her husband, boxed several times and
her head banged against the window. There was no inconsistency or incongruity
in her bringing the complainant away from her husband's vicious reach.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assigned errors have no merit. We also agree with the
following findings of the lower court:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a close study of the two versions presented in this
case, the Court is more inclined to believe the version given by the
prosecution. In the first place, the accused had pictured <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
to have been very much in love with him. In fact <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
was also pictured not only as the passionate type but even the aggressive type.
Thus the accused claimed that it was <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> who
approached him while in bed in <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>; that several sexual intercourses that followed
were committed without the slightest resistance or objection on the part of <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>; that on the night in question <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
was so in a hurry to cohabit with him that she even tripped him while he was
trying to see if his wife was already asleep in the room. On top of this all,
the wife of the accused tried to further picture <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
as a very daring and highly immodest woman because according to the wife of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> was completely naked while having
intercourse with the accused just outside of the room of their house. Indeed if
these were all true <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> must be madly in love
with the accused so much that she would risk unfavorable consequences just to
maintain her relationship with the man she loved. Such a situation as pictured
by the defense runs counter to the fact that barely a week after the incident
in <span class="GramE">question,</span> and with the accused having done nothing
to displease her, she filed not only one criminal charge but two.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Aside from the fact that the version of the accused in its
entirety appears to be incredible, an examination of the evidence for the
defense would also show vital contradiction which would affect the credibility
of the version presented by the defense. For example, according to the accused
when he and <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> went down the house and proceeded
to a side of a river, <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> was wearing only a
T-shirt without clothing underneath. On the other hand, the wife of the accused
testified that when <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> left her house after she
was caught having intercourse with accused, she was completely naked. In this
connection, it would not be an exaggeration to again brand this portion of the
evidence for the defense as utterly incredible and absolutely contrary to human
decency. The Court has observed the behavior of <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
while on the witness stand and the Court is convinced that she is not the type
of a woman who would dare, under similar circumstances, to be out in the street
completely nude.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Secondly as already stated above the defense claims that
after the wife of the accused have caught <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> and
the accused in the act, the wife of the accused clubbed <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
and beat her mercilessly until she fell down the stairs. Yet in another part of
the story of the defense, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">it is </span>said
that both went back to the house begging for forgiveness from the wife of the
accused and at the same time pro­posed that she be allowed to share the house
of the spouses. This again is highly incredible because no person in his right
senses would have the temerity to make such an indecent proposal to the
offended spouse after receiving severe beatings from the hands of the
latter."</blockquote>
