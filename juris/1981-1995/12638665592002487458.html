portion of the decision reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> is now before
this Court seeking a reversal of the aforementioned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his Brief, he alleged that the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> gravely erred <span style="">in </span>convicting
him for a violation of Section 4, Article II of Presidential Decree 1675 on the
basis of the untruthful statements of the prosecution witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the evidence presented by the prosecu­tion, at
one o'clock in the afternoon of February 13, 1984, Capt. Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and Pfc. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
received a tip from an informant that a certain "Junior <span class="SpellE">Paa</span>" was actively engaged in selling and distributing
marijuana leaves and fruiting tops to prospective buyers including students in
nearby schools within the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Labores</span>
Extension, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on that information, Lt. Col. Manuel T. <span class="SpellE">Raval</span>, the Commanding Officer of the 13th NRU, Narcotics
Command, Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
ordered Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> to form a team to conduct a
buy-bust operation against the said "Junior <span class="SpellE">Paa</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on that same afternoon, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time>, the team composed of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>, Pfc. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, Pfc.
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> and the informant proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Labores</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
where the trafficking of marijuana was believed to take place.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> positioned himself at a
strategic place, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> and the informant walked
along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Labores</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not long after when they were
approached by the suspect Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> alias
"Junior <span class="SpellE">Paa</span>" (a childhood <span class="SpellE">monicker</span> on account of his big feet).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They conversed with him for a while and then
Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> handed the suspect two (2) marked ten peso
bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suspect then left his
supposed buyers and went inside a small alley.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he returned with two (2) tea bags of marijuana leaves and
fruiting tops which he gave to Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receiving the goods, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span> scratched his head as a pre-arranged signal to his
teammates to come over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Captain <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, rushing
to where the three were, immediately accosted the suspect Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> and placed him under arrest after identifying
themselves as NARCOM operatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> interrogated <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> who
verbally admitted his guilt and even pointed to one alias <span class="SpellE">Ody</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Odie</span>) as the one who received the <st1:time minute="10" hour="14">two (2) ten</st1:time> peso bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NARCOM agents also found in <span class="SpellE">Viloria's</span> possession another tea bag of dried marijuana
leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marked money was never
recovered.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The two tea bags, upon laboratory examination were found "positive to the
test for mariju<span style="">a</span>na, a prohibitive
drug."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, accused Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>
alias "Junior <span class="SpellE">Paa</span>", 31 years old, a
construction helper/electrician testi­fied that at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1984</st1:date>, while walking along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Labores</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> in <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span> on his way home, he saw a boy being chased by two
men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The boy managed to elude his
pursuers so the latter turned to the accused and asked him if he knew a person
by the <span style="">name </span>of "<span class="SpellE">Pogs</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
answered that he did not know anyone by that name but despite his denial, he
was nonetheless brought for verification inside a parked <span class="SpellE">Tamaraw</span>
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside he saw three (3) persons
who had also been apprehended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
all taken to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> for interrogation but
he never gave any written statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
averred that he was charged as a pusher because he failed to help the two
agents in catching the boy at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Labores</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a consequence, they suspected him of being in connivance with the boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He signed a receipt<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
against his will because he could no longer endure the maltreatment done to him
by the PC officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That receipt
attested that three (3) tea bags of marijuana leaves and fruiting tops had been
seized from him.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction must be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>, who posed as the buyer, and
Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> clearly and positively identified accused <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> as the marijuana peddler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Viloria's</span> bare
denials and his unsubstantiated allega­tion that he was being framed up because
he did not help the law enforcers in capturing a certain boy <span style="">is </span>quite incredible and cannot
overcome the positive and unequivocal statements of the <span style="">two </span>operatives that it was the accused <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>
who had sold them the marijuana leaves and fruiting tops.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contradiction pointed out by the accused in the
testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Pfcs</span>. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> regarding the description of the seized
marijuana is too trivial to warrant an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the tea bags contained
marijuana leaves and fruiting tops or simply marijuana stalks and seeds does
not alter at all the inescapable truth that <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span>
had been caught red-handed in the act of peddling illicit drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the two peace officers could not be
faulted for making the wrong analysis of the marijuana because they are not
experts in that field.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also called attention to the non-recovery of the two
marked ten peso bills which accused reportedly passed on to "<span class="SpellE">Ody</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
contended that if the money were not retrieved, then it could not be
established that the delivery of the goods was by virtue of that cash.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, provides:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.45in;">"Section 4. <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>,
Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of Prohibitive Drugs.
- The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty
thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person who, unless
authorized by law, shall <span style="">sell, </span>administer,
deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any
prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the victim of the offense is a minor, or
should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the
proximate cause of the death of the victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein
provided shall be imposed."</p>

<p class="BODY">That the marked bills had not been found is inconsequen­tial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Monetary consideration is not an essential
element of the crime under discussion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere act of selling or even acting as a broker in a sale of
marijuana and other prohibited drugs consummates the crime under Section 4.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Just recently, the Court had occasion to reiterate this principle
in the c<span style="">ase of <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Romeo</u>
</span><u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Meda</u></span>,
G.R. No. 87607, <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1990</st1:date>,
thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The failure of the prosecution to present the twenty-peso
bill used in the buy-bust operation does not negate the existence of the crime
charged against the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People
<span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Gatong</span>-o,
No. 78698, December 29, 1988, it was held that even without the money to buy
the marijuana, when the police officer went through the motion as a buyer and
his offer was accepted by the appellants and the marijuana delivered to the
police officer, the crime was consummated by the delivery of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
G.R. No. 81332, April 25, 1989, '(T)he fact that the accused returned with the
amount of marijuana corresponding to the offered price suffices to constitute
if not sale, then delivery or giving away to another and distribution of the
prohibited drug punishable under Section 4, Article II of Republic Act 6425.’
It was not clearly established where the twenty-peso bill went but it does not
weaken the cause of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
long as the marijuana actually given by the accused was presented before the
lower court, the absence of marked money does not create a hiatus in the
prosecution evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, G.R. No. 81332, April 25, 1989)"</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we see no reason to reverse the appellate ruling of the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Compared to the baseless
disclaimers of the accused, the narration of the incident by the prosecution
witnesses is far more worthy of belief coming as it does from law enforcers who
are presumed to have regularly performed their duty in the absence of
convincing proof to the contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
