Criminal Court of the Seventh Judicial District in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> which was promulgated in open court on April
22, 1974, sentencing the above-named accused Alfredo Regular and Arturo de Lara
to suffer the penalty of death for the killing of prisoner Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and the penalty of imprisonment from <u>reclusion
temporal</u> minimum to <u>reclusion temporal</u> maximum for seriously
wounding prisoner Emilio Esparza.</p>

<p class="BODY">Here is one of those unfortunate cases that have arisen due to,
among other factors, the wretched and deplorable condition of prison life and
confinement which have destroyed the sense and sanity of many of the inmates,
goading them to violence, riots, and even killing fellow prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thus, this Court has taken a considerate
understanding of their plight, their misery and despair in order that they may
not be "reduced to the level of animals and convert a prison term into
prolonged torture and slow death." (See People vs. De <span class="SpellE">los</span>

accused with murder and frustrated murder allegedly committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 16th day of November, 1970 in the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison, <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this

assaulted, attacked and stabbed with improvised deadly weapons, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, No. 50600P and Emilio Esparza, No. 50092P, both
sentenced prisoners serving prison sentences in the same institution, thereby
inflicting upon Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, multiple stab wounds in
the different parts of his body, which wounds necessarily produced the latter's
death and simultaneously inflicting upon Emilio Esparza stab wounds on the
different parts of the body thus performing all the acts of execution which
would have produced the crime of murder nevertheless did not produce by reason
of causes independent of their will, that is by the timely and able defense by
Esparza which prevented the consummation of the offense of murder.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the arraignment, the Court pro­ceeded in open
court to render sentence on the two accused, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the spontaneous and voluntary
confession of guilt of the accused Alfredo Regular and Arturo de Lara, the
Court finds them guilty, beyond reason­able doubt, of the crime of Murder as
defined in Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, in relation to Art. 50 thereto,
as charged in the information and hereby sentences them to the penalty of Death
as far as the crime of murder is concerned and to suffer the penalty of
seventeen (17) years and one (1) day of Reclusion Temporal as minimum to twenty
(20) years of Reclusion Temporal as maximum for the crime of frustrated murder,
to indemnify the heirs of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> the amount of
P12,000.00; to pay the amount of P12,000.00 as moral damages and another
P12,000.00 as exemplary damages; and to pay their proportionate share of costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, in view of the presence of the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary confession of guilt made by the accused as provided for, under
paragraph 7, Art. 13 of the Revised Penal Code, the Court be­lieves that the
imposition of the death penalty be commuted to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in the case
of People vs. <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>, State Prosecutor Francisco
Guerrero is hereby ordered to present evidence to substantiate the charge of
Murder and Frustrated Murder in order to determine the degree of the
culpability of the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the directive of the Court "to
substantiate the charge of Murder and Frustrated Murder in order to determine
the degree of the culpability of the accused," the prosecution presented
four witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Briefly, the prosecution
evidence may be related, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30</st1:time> in the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1970</st1:date>,
prisoners Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>, member of <span class="SpellE">Batang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Gang and Emilio Esparza, member of <span class="SpellE">Batang</span> <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> Gang, were gathering
<span class="SpellE">camote</span> tops at the back of Building 4 of the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prisons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While they were thus pre­occupied, the two accused, Alfredo Regular and
Arturo de Lara, together with <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> and Reynaldo Castro, all members of the rival <span class="SpellE">Sigue-sigue</span> Sputnik Gang, suddenly stabbed <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and Esparza, as a result of which <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span>
died on the spot while Esparza, who was able to parry the thrust of his
assailant, was imme­diately brought to the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Hospital for treat­ment of his injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon investigation by the prison guards, it was learned that the
assailants surreptitiously went out from Dormitory 4-D after sawing the iron
grills at the south end of Building 4.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The day before, members of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-sigue</span>
Sputnik Gang were the targets of darts thrown by the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
group composed of <span class="SpellE">Batang</span> <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Batang</span> <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
gangs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged treacherous attack by
the rival group rankled in the minds of the <span class="SpellE">Sigue-sigue</span>
members who planned immediate and swift reprisal to avenge the injuries of
their <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, armed with improvised bladed weapons, the assailants pounced upon
the unsuspecting victims (<span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and Esparza) until
the former died and the latter was seriously wounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the stabbing spree, the malefactors returned to their
respective dormitories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, prisoners
Regular, de Lara and Castro gave up and admitted the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They executed extra-judicial confessions
acknowledging participation in the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, Esparza was treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Argente</span>
Alejandro who found the following wounds in the different regions of the body:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ladoy's</span> autopsy, conducted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ibarrola</span>, proved that his death was caused by massive loss
of blood resulting from multiple stab wounds found in his body.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the evidence of the defense is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the eve of <st1:date year="1970" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1970</st1:date>, while de Lara was in his brigade, he heard <span class="SpellE">Rodulfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Patuga</span> say to his <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>, <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> and Castro,

<p class="BODY">About past <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, <span class="SpellE">Noli</span> <span class="SpellE">Patuga</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and Esparza
gathering <span class="SpellE">camote</span> tops at the back of Building 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group approached the victims
stealthily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Patuga</span> and Castro followed suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused de Lara thrust his improvised weapon
into the body of <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> only once, upon the command of
<span class="SpellE">Patuga</span>, but he did not know whether he hit the
victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Alfredo Regular testified that he did not know either <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> or Esparza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1970" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1970</st1:date>, he
alleged that he was inside his brigade the whole day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that day, according to this accused,
no unusual incident happened inside the prison walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stayed in his brigade up to the 18th of
that month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was called that day to
the investigation section of the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span>
Prison.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was investigated by one
Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was made to sign a piece of paper, the contents of which he had not
read.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied any par­ticipation in
the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and the wounding of
Esparza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was
maltreated by <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> so that he would sign a piece of
paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room in which he was brought was
dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was boxed and was beaten with a
rubber stick and a big book.</p>

<p class="BODY">On being confronted with the fact that de Lara mentioned him as
one of those who killed <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and wounded Esparza,
Regular alleged that de Lara implicated him because he bore a grudge against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regular alleged that when they were
still free, the girlfriend of de Lara transferred her affection to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, according to Regular, made de Lara
angry vowing to revenge such outrage.</p>

<p class="BODY">After several hearings of these cases, the trial court imposed
the same principal penalty it imposed during the arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court found three aggravating
circumstances present in the commission of the crime, namely, treachery,
evident premeditation, and recidivism, necessitating the imposition of the
appro­priate penalties in the maximum period.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal, appellant Arturo de Lara assigned two errors
committed by the trial court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>1. The lower court erred in holding that appel­lant Arturo de Lara
employed treachery and evident pre­meditation in killing the victim Felipe <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and wounding prisoner Emilio Esparza.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The lower court erred in finding defendant-appellant Arturo de
Lara guilty of the crime of murder and frustrated murder instead of completely
exempting him from any criminal liability on the ground of reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Regular contends that the lower court erred in imposing
the death penalty based on the allegations of treachery, evident premeditation
and reci­divism, which were not fully supported by evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants further maintain that they
were only acting in defense of their <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>, hence
the penalties im­posed in both cases are not in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it must be stated that the plea of guilty by the
two accused were improvidently laid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
the arraignment, the trial judge did not adhere strictly to the doctrine laid
down in <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Apduhan</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where We postulated the guideline in cases where there is a plea of guilty by
the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case under
review, We observe that the trial judge failed to explain fully to the two
accused the meaning and the far-reaching effect of their plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not explained to them the meaning of
the term "treachery," an aggravating circumstance which qualified the
crime to murder and frustrated murder respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did the judge explain the terms
"evident premeditation" and "recidivism", both aggravating
circumstances alleged in the information which had legal significance and
consequences not ordinarily understandable to a layman.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge asked the appellants whether they were aware that
the court had no other alternative except to impose the capital punishment on
them without explaining why it had to be so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Solacito</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
We had the occasion to say that, "(j)<span class="SpellE">udges</span> are
duty-bound to be extra solicitous in seeing to it that when an accused pleads
guilty, he understands fully the meaning of his plea and the import of an
inevitable conviction."</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge immediately rendered sentence in open court after
the arraignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an afterthought or
as a justification for the imposition of the capital punishment, the trial
judge conducted several hearings and called for presentation of evidence by the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The hearings subsequently held proved that the appellants' plea
were not unconditional admissions of guilt and they were not of such nature as
to foreclose appellants' right to defend themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their plea of guilt became ambiguous and
qualified in the light of what transpired during the presentation of evidence
that followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their extrajudicial confessions, both accused admitted their
participation in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and the
wounding of Esparza.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have gone over thoroughly the extrajudicial confessions of the
two accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In these extrajudicial confessions,
nothing is said on how the crimes were committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only thing that these extrajudicial
confessions had brought out of the two accused is the fact that they had
participated in the stabbing spree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
open court, the accused de Lara made explanatory statements on how he became
involved in the case, while the accused Regular completely repudiated his
confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true, of course that under the Rules and in the spirit of
fair play, the whole of the confession must be put in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An extrajudicial confession may be accepted
in its entirety or only a part thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
To accept fragments of the confession which limits or modifies the criminality
of the accused and suppresses others which aggravates such behavior is utterly
inconsistent with justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> rule
admits of certain exceptions, for it is not absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are instances, occasions and
circumstances which can make it justifiably imperative to believe or accept
only a part of the confession and reject the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One such instance is when an accused, in his
testimony, makes some explanatory statements tending to mitigate his
participation in the crimes committed and the prosecution fails to rebut such
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearings that followed, the prosecution failed to
prove that the two accused committed the crime charged in the information with
the attending aggravating circumstances alleged therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">De Lara's testimony, which was <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>,
showed that he was only invited to join the group, an invitation which he
hesitantly accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he testified:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

inkling that he would be joining the group before he was invited to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is reason to believe that he accepted
the "invitation" with the knowledge that he had no other recourse but
to join them having eavesdropped the night before, knowing what his

refused to join.</p>

that neither joint nor simultaneous action <u>per</u> <u>se</u> is a sufficient
<span class="SpellE">indicium</span> of conspiracy; a common design must further

<p class="BODY">From the testimonial evidence adduced above, it is clear that de
Lara was not included in the plan to reta­liate against the injuries suffered
by their <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span> in the hands of their rival gang
who caught them unaware that Sunday before <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> was
slain.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it cannot be said that de Lara was acting under the impulse
of uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury, it is reasonable to
conclude that what happened was not entirely his own will and volition for he
was more or less forced by his <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span> to par­ticipate
in the stabbing spree.</p>

<p class="BODY">We come now to the other accused, Alfredo Regular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that during the taking of
testimonial evidence, this accused evaded answering questions relating to his
participation in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and the
wounding of Esparza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that on <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1970</st1:date>, a certain Ignacio
<span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> of the Investigation Section of the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prison brought him into a room wherein he was
investigated and was made to answer some questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further alleged that he was boxed and
beaten.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room which he was brought
was dark, according to him, despite the fact that he was there from ten in the
mor­ning up to three in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he was made to sign a piece of paper without reading it so he does
not know its contents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paper he was
referring to turned out to be his confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to where he was on that fateful day, Regular testified, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style=""> </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was inside, Sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While you were

We held that, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)t would be unsound practice
for the court to disregard the con­fession of an accused simply because the
accused repudiates it during the trial." It cannot be believed that the
confession was coerced from Regular considering that the confession is replete
with details which can only be given by the person who had experienced the same
or had taken part in the execution of the acts narrated.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the extrajudicial confession of both accused, it appears
that Regular was not one of the men who planned the killing incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As mentioned earlier, the prisoners <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patuga</span> and de Castro
engineered the stabbing spree and since Regular was not a co­conspirator, the
acts done by the three named prisoners cannot and would not prejudice the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same aggravating circumstances, namely, trea­chery, evident
premeditation and recidivism were imputed against Regular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Treachery cannot be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like all other circumstances which aggravate
or qualify the commission of the crime, the existence of treachery must be
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
incumbent upon the prosecution to present evidence to prove such allega­tion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the prosecution failed miserably to prove
that the killing of <span class="SpellE">Ladoy</span> and the wounding of Esparza
was attended with treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were
no wit­nesses who saw how the stabbings were done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing was mentioned in the extrajudicial
confessions of the accused as to the means, methods, or manner of execution of
the crimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, it
cannot be established by mere suppositions, drawn from circumstances prior to
the aggression, that the accused had employed means tending to insure the
success of their dastardly act without any danger to his person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The circumstances specifying an offense or
aggravating the penalty thereof must be proved as conclusively as the act
itself, mere presumptions being insufficient to establish their pre­sence
according to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter how truthful
these suppositions or presumptions may seem, they must not and they cannot
produce the effect of aggravating the crimes of the defendant.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstances of evident premedita­tion cannot
also be appreciated against the accused Regular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a proven fact that Regular was not with
the group of <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Patuga</span>
and de Castro when the latter planned the retaliation for the dart-attack made
upon their <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of deliberate premeditation exist only if it
could be shown beyond reasonable doubt that there intervened a period of time
long enough in a judicial sense to afford full opportunity for meditation and
reflection thus enabling the conscience of the accused to overcome the
resolution of his will if he would only pay heed to its warning.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no proof that Regular had known of the plan to kill
and/or stab any member of the rival gang.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The records of the case are scanty with regards to cir­cumstances prior
to the event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that de
Lara, in his confession, alleged that Regular was one of the men who sawed the
iron grills in the window of their brigade, this part of his confession was
repu­diated by him in open court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that he implicated Regular because he had a grudge against him for
taking away his girlfriend while they were still free.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Regular's own confession do not narrate the events prior to the killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While this Court is convinced that Regular
participated in the stabbing spree, It is not convinced that he did it with
treachery and evident premeditation simply because the prosecution had failed
to establish beyond reasonable doubt that indeed the commission of these crimes
were attended by the alleged aggravating circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of treachery and
premeditation, the crimes committed by the two accused are homicide and
frustrated homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused are quasi-recidivists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De Lara was serving sentence for robbery<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>

</span>Although they entered a voluntary plea of guilty, they are not entitled
to the benefits of this ordinary mitigating circumstance because the impo­sition
of the maximum penalty under Article 160, Revised Penal Code is mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Bautista, et al., 65 SCRA
460).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty for homicide is <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> (Art. 249, R.P.C.) and that for frustrated homicide is one
degree lower, (Art. 50, R.P.C.) although the courts, in view of the facts of
the case, may impose upon the accused a penalty lower by one degree than that
which should be imposed under the provisions of Art. 50. (Art. 250, R.P.C.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision of the
