the increase constitutes a whopping 21.22% average increase of the 89-90
tuition fees and that the said increase was made without prior consultation to
the parents which is a requirement before any such increase should be made
effective;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">‘6. The aforesaid
increase was not approved and vigorously objected to by the plaintiff as
contained in its letters to defendant Rodolfo J. Lagera x x x Honorable Isidro
Cariño in his capacity as the Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports x x x
These two letters brought to the attention of the defendants that the tuition
fees presently being charged by defendants Bloomfield Academy are already among
the highest in the community, even if compared to Dela Salle Ayala and
Elizabeth Seton which have much better school and library facilities than the
defendant, and that the proposed increase is not only untimely but grossly
inappropriate, and, worse, without any valid basis already, after both parties
agreed on 50% of the increase which was implemented and paid by the students
during the school year with the clear understanding that the other 50% is waived
by the defendant;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">‘7. In spite of the
clear sharing by the plaintiff through the aforesaid letters of the gross
inappropriateness of the aforesaid proposal increase in tuition fees,
defendants Honorable Isidro Cariño, blindly approved such proposal in its
letter addressed to defendant Rodolfo S. Lagera dated March 27, 1990 x x x;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">‘8. Subsequently
plaintiff received from the defendant Bloomfield Academy through defendant
Rodolfo S. Lagera a letter x x x demanding full payment of the approved tuition
fee increase on or before April 6, 1990 in blatant isolation of the agreement
with the plaintiff that only 50% of the increase will be collected.  As a matter of fact, the plaintiff has
already paid the said 50% of the increase;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">‘9. The
implementation of the aforesaid approval to increase tuition fees, if not
retained by this Honorable Court, would work injustice to the herein plaintiff

for increase in the rentals of the buildings retroactively for three (3)
years.'</p>

<blockquote>"It is a well established rule that the grant or denial of an
injunction rests upon the sound discretion of the court, in the exercise of
which appellate courts will not interfere except on a case of a clear abuse
(Belisle Investment and Finance Co., Inc. W. State Investment House; Rodolfo
vs. Alfonso, 76 Phil. 225).  And to
justify the issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> it must be shown that the
abuse of discretion was grave and patent and that the discretion was exercised
arbitrarily or despotically (Soriano, et al., vs. Atienza, et al., 171 SCRA
284).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rightly or wrongly, respondent judge's conclusion, which
served as basis in issuing the questioned writ, was reached only after
considering the facts bared in the course of the hearing.  In other words, respondent judge was merely
exercising his judgment.  Errors of
judgment are not within the province of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
(Purefoods Corporation vs. NLRC, 174 SCRA 415).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One thing we noticed about this petition is that the issues
raised are factual involving as they do errors of judgment on the part of
respondent judge.  Invariably, we
encounter the following arguments:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'x x public respondent Judge de Guzman appears to have been
mislead by the private respondent BAPAA's claim that petitioner Bloomfield
Academy did not conduct the requisite consultation before implementing the
tuition fee increase.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘x x public respondent Judge de Guzman appears to have been mislead
by the private respondent's untruthful claim.'</p>

<blockquote>"It must emphatically be reiterated, since so often it is
overlooked, the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> is a remedy designed
for the correction of errors of jurisdiction and not errors of judgment.  Consequently, an error of jurisdiction is
not controvertible through the original civil action of <i>certiorari</i>
(Purefoods Corporation vs. NLRC, 171 SCRA 418).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Anent the allegation that respondent judge disregarded the
fact that the private respondent failed to exhaust available administrative
remedies in assailing the decision of the Department of Education Culture and
Sports approving the tuition fee increase suffice it to state that the
principle requiring the previous exhaustion of administrative remedies is not
applicable when the respondent is a department secretary whose act as an
alter-ego of the President beers the implied or assumed approval of the latter
(Animos vs. Phil. Veterans Affairs Office, 174 SCRA 214)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent filed with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> an
action, entitled "Injunction with Preliminary Prohibitory Injunction with
Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order" (docketed Civil Case No. 90-971),
against petitioners and the Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports
("DECS") seeking to stop the implementation of the increase in
tuition fees by petitioner school.  Private
respondent asserted that the increase was adopted without the prior
consultation required by <span style="">law </span>and
that, in any case, the approved increase was exorbitant (at 21.22%).  Petitioners, on their part, contended that
the parties did, in fact, hold consultations at which the wage increase for
teachers mandated by Republic Act 6727 and the resulting increase in tuition
fees allowed by Republic Act No. 6728 were discussed at length.  The Solicitor General, answering the
complaint for and in behalf of the <span style="">DECS </span>Secretary,
attested to the approval <span style="">by DECS </span>of
a fifty percent (50%) tuition fee increase for the school year 1989-1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judicial action initiated by private respondent before the
court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>appears to us to be an inappropriate
recourse.  It remains undisputed that
the <span style="">DECS </span>Secretary has, in fact,
taken cognizance of the case for the tuition fee increase and has accordingly
acted thereon.  We can only assume that
in so doing the <span style="">DECS </span>Secretary
has duly passed upon the relevant legal and factual issues dealing on the
propriety of the matter.  In the
decision process, the <span style="">DECS </span>Secretary
has verily acted in a quasi-judicial capacity.  The remedy from that decision is an appeal.  Conformably with Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the exclusive appellate
jurisdiction to question that administrative action lies with the Court of
Appeals, not with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.  If we were to consider, upon the other hand, the case for
injunction filed with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> to be an ordinary action
solely against herein petitioners (with DECS being then deemed to be merely a
nominal party), it would have meant the court's taking cognizance over the case
in disregard of the doctrine of primary jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can we treat the case as a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
or prohibition as the complaint filed by private respondent with the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, contains no allegation of lack, or grave abuse in the exercise, of
jurisdiction on the part of DECS nor has there been any finding made to that
effect by either the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>or the appellate court that could
warrant the extraordinary remedy.  A
special civil action, either for <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition, can be
grounded only on either lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In passing, we also observe that the parties have both remained
silent on the provisions of Republic Act No. 6728 to the effect that in case of
disagreement on tuition fee increases (in this instance by herein private
parties), the issue should be resolved through arbitration.  Although the matter has not been raised by
the parties, it is an aspect, nevertheless, in our view, that could have well
been explored by them instead of immediately invoking, such as they apparently
did, the administrative and judicial relief <span style="">to resolve the controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we hold that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> has been
bereft of jurisdiction in taking cognizance of private respondent's
complaint.  We see no real
justification, on the basis of the factual and case settings here obtaining, to
permit a deviation from the long standing rule that the issue of jurisdiction
may be raised at any time even on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, conformably with our above opinion, the instant
petition is GRANTED and the questioned order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
and the decision of the appellate court are SET ASIDE.  No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
