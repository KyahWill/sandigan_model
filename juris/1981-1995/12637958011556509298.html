<p class="BODY">IN THE RESOLUTION OF <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">OCTOBER
 14, 1985</st1:date>, THE FIRST DIVISION OF THIS COURT, WITHOUT GIVING DUE
COURSE TO THE PETITION, REQUIRED THE RESPONDENTS TO COMMENT THEREON (ROLLO, P.

<p class="BODY">A CAREFUL PERUSAL OF THE RECORDS AS WELL AS THE ARGUMENTS ADDUCED
BY BOTH PARTIES, REVEALS THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY DENIED DUE COURSE
TO SUBJECT PETITION.</p>

<p class="BODY">AS ABLY DEMONSTRATED BY SAID APPELLATE COURT, THE ISSUES RAISED
BY THE PETITIONERS HAD LONG BEEN LAID TO REST BY THE SUPREME COURT.</p>

<p class="BODY">THE MAIN THRUST OF THIS PETITION IS THE ALLEGED FAILURE OF THE
INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT TO RULE AMONG OTHERS ON THE INACTION OF THE LOWER
COURT TO TIMELY RESOLVE PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDER PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF SAID PETITIONERS' MOTION TO
DISCHARGE THE WRIT OF PRELIMINA­RY ATTACHMENT BY POSTING A COUNTERBOND EQUAL TO
THE AMOUNT OF PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>OTHERWISE STATED, PETITION­ERS APPEAR TO BE OF THE VIEW THAT UPON THEIR
POSTING OF A COUNTERBOND WHICH ACCOMPANIES THEIR MOTION TO DISCHARGE THE WRIT
OF PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT, IT IS MANDATORY FOR THE RESPONDENT JUDGE TO STAY THE
ENFORCEMENT OF SAID WRIT.</p>

<p class="BODY">IT WILL BE RECALLED THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY ISSUED A
TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AS PRAYED FOR BY THE PETITIONERS IN G.R. NO. 69819
"BALISLE INVEST­MENT AND FINANCE CO., INC., ET AL. VS. STATE INVESTMENT
HOUSE, INC., ET AL." IN THE RESOLUTION OF THE FIRST DIVISION DATED <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="3">MARCH 13, 1985</st1:date>, BEFORE SUBJECT
PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i>, PROHIBITION AND <i>MANDAMUS</i> WITH
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER WAS REFERRED TO THE
COURT OF APPEALS FOR PROPER DETERMINATION OF THE CASE AND ALL PENDING
INCIDENTS.</p>

<p class="BODY">IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE CASE AND PENDING INCI­DENTS, THE
COURT OF APPEALS CANNOT BE FAULTED FOR NOT HAVING RULED ON THE ALLEGED INACTION
OF RESPONDENT JUDGE TO ISSUE THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION OR RESTRAINING ORDER IN
THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street> TO STOP THE
ENFORCEMENT OF THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT.</p>

<p class="BODY">IT IS A WELL ESTABLISHED RULE THAT THE GRANT OR DENIAL OF AN
INJUNCTION RESTS UPON THE SOUND DISCRETION OF THE COURT, IN THE EXERCISE OF
WHICH APPELLATE COURTS WILL NOT INTERFERE EXCEPT ON A CLEAR CASE OF ABUSE
(YAPTINCHAY VS. TORRES, 28 SCRA 489 [1969]).</p>

<p class="BODY">AS CORRECTLY FOUND BY THE COURT OF APPEALS, NO GRAVE ABUSE OF
DISCRETION CAN BE ASCRIBED TO RESPONDENT JUDGE EITHER IN THE ISSUANCE OF THE
WRIT OF ATTACHMENT WITHOUT NOTICE TO PETITIONERS AS THERE IS NOTHING IN THE
RULES OF COURT WHICH MAKES NOTICE AND HEARING INDISPENSABLE AND MANDATORY
REQUISITES IN THE ISSUANCE OF A WRIT OF ATTACHMENT (FILINVEST CREDIT
CORPORATION VS. RELOVA, 117 SCRA 420) OR IN THE FAILURE OF RESPONDENT JUDGE TO
IMMEDIATELY RESTRAIN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY ATTACHMENT UPON
PETITIONERS' POST­ING OF A COUNTERBOND FOR INDEED, THE RULES AND JURIS­PRUDENCE
REQUIRE THAT NO PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHALL ISSUE WITHOUT HEARING.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>IN FACT THE ISSUANCE OF IN­JUNCTION <u>EX</u>
<u>PARTE</u> IS DISCOURAGED AND THE COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THAT PRELIMINARY
INJUNCTION IS AN EXTRA­ORDINARY PEREMPTORY REMEDY THAT SHOULD BE DISPENSED WITH
CIRCUMSPECTION, AND BOTH SIDES SHOULD FIRST BE HEARD WHENEVER POSSIBLE (RAMOS
VS. COURT OF APPEALS, 95 SCRA 360 [1980]; PALAMAN LUMBER &amp; PLYWOOD CO.,
INC., ET AL. VS. ARRANZ, ET AL., L-27106, 22 SCRA 1194 [1968]).</p>

<p class="BODY">MOREOVER, THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY RULED THAT THE MERE POSTING
OF A COUNTERBOND DOES NOT AUTO­MATICALLY DISCHARGE THE WRIT OF ATTACHMENT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>IT IS ONLY AFTER HEARING AND AFTER THE JUDGE
HAS ORDERED THE DISCHARGE OF THE ATTACHMENT IF A CASH DEPOSIT IS MADE OR A
COUNTERBOND IS EXECUTED TO THE ATTACHING CREDITOR IS FILED, THAT THE WRIT OF
ATTACHMENT IS PROPERLY DIS­CHARGED UNDER SECTION 12, RULE 57 OF THE RULES OF
COURT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>WHILE IT IS UNDISPUTED THAT <st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> HEARD THE PARTIES ON <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="2">FEBRUARY 4, 1985</st1:date>, THEY WERE THEREAFTER GIVEN A
TOTAL OF NINE (9) DAYS TO FILE THEIR WRITTEN PLEAD­INGS AFTER WHICH THE MOTION
WOULD BE DEEMED SUBMITTED FOR RESOLUTION.</p>

<p class="BODY">THUS, BOTH THE MOTION TO DISCHARGE ATTACHMENT AND THE MOTION FOR
THE ISSUANCE OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION TO STAY THE ENFORCEMENT THEREOF, WERE
STILL PENDING CON­SIDERATION BY THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
WITH BOTH PARTIES STILL FILING PLEADINGS UP TO <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="2">FEBRUARY 14, 1985</st1:date>, WHEN PETITION­ERS FILED SUBJECT
PETITION WITH THE SUPREME COURT ON <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="2">FEBRUARY
 8, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>TO SAY THE LEAST,
THE PETITION IN THE INSTANT CASE WAS PREMATURE.</p>

<p class="BODY">THIS COURT HAS RULED THAT BEFORE FILING A PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i>
IN A HIGHER COURT, THE ATTENTION OF THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
SHOULD GENERALLY BE FIRST CALLED TO ITS SUPPOSED ERROR AND ITS CORRECTION
SHOULD BE SOUGHT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>IF THIS IS NOT DONE,
THE PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> SHOULD BE DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THE REASON FOR THIS RULE IS THAT ISSUES WHICH
COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE ARE BOUND TO DECIDE SHOULD NOT SUMMARILY BE TAKEN FROM
THEM AND SUBMITTED TO AN APPELLATE COURT WITHOUT FIRST GIVING SUCH LOWER COURTS
THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISPOSE OF THE SAME WITH DUE DELIBERATION (BUTUAN BAY WOOD
EXPORT CORP. VS. COURT OF APPEALS, 97 PHIL. 297-298 [1980]).</p>

<p class="BODY">UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
SHOULD BE THE PROPER FORUM TO THRESH OUT THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT PRIVATE
RESPONDENTS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ENJOINED OR RESTRAINED FROM THE ENFORCEMENT
OF THE QUESTIONED ATTACHMENT ORDER (RUBIO VS. MARIANO, 52 SCRA 344 [1973]), AS
WELL AS THE MATTER OF WHETHER OR NOT THE WRIT OF ATTACHMENT ISSUED BY THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> SHOULD BE DISCHARGED.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, (A) THE INSTANT PETITION IS HEREBY
DENIED AND THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS IS HEREBY AFFIRMED, AND (B)
THIS CASE IS REMANDED TO THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
FOR TRIAL ON THE MERITS AND FOR THE DETER­MINATION OF ALL PENDING INCIDENTS.</p>
