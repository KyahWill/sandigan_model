Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Angeles City, and docketed therein as Criminal
Case No. 12502, accused Winifred David was charged with the violation of
Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425 (the Dangerous Drugs Act) allegedly
committed as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the prosecution presented as its witnesses Maj.
Marlene Salangad, Pfc. Lauro Mamac, Pfc. Inadio Ibay, and Pfc. Danilo Cruz for
its evidence in chief, and recalled Pfc. Danilo Cruz on rebuttal.  The defense presented the accused and his brother,
Ronaldo David.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts appear from the prosecution’s evidence:  At around 11:00 a.m. of 12 June 1990, Lt.
Romeo Consengco, Chief of the PC Narcotics Command (NARCOM) based in Angeles
City, instructed some NARCOM intelligence officers, namely, Pfc. Lauro Mamac,
Pfc. Inadio Ibay, Pfc. Danilo Cruz, and Pfc. Arimbuyutan to conduct an
entrapment operation against a certain Butch, a resident of Sor Luisa St.,
Brgy. Virgen de los Remedios, Angeles City.  Butch was earlier identified by the NARCOM officers during a
surveillance in the area.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Before undertaking the operation, Lt. Consengco conducted a briefing.  A <span style="">P10.00
</span>bill and two P5.00 bills, to be used as buy-bust money, were marked by
Pfc. Cruz with his initials<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> and
the members of the team were given their respective roles.  Pfc. Lauro Mamac was designated as the
poseur­buyer,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Pfc. Ibay was to be the back-up of Pfc. Mamac,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> and
Pfc. Cruz and Pfc. Arimbuyutan made up the rest of the back-up team.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Photocopies of the P5.00 bills were made and Lt. Consengco delivered to Pfc.
Mamac the marked bills.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the members of the team hired a passenger jeep and
proceeded to the designated area via the Villa Pampang route.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In front of a store, Pfc. Mamac approached a man to whom he intimated his
desire to buy marijuana.  The man told
him that he knew someone selling marijuana and pointed to the accused who was
in front of the store.  Pfc. Mamac
approached the accused and told him that he wanted to buy marijuana.  The accused asked him the quantity he wanted
to buy.  Pfc. Mamac told him that he
would buy ten pesos worth of marijuana.  After advising Pfc. Mamac to wait, the accused left and then came back
handing to Pfc. Mamac two small plastic bags of marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In turn, Pfc. Mamac gave him the marked bills and immediately took off his cap
-- a prearranged signal which meant that his companions could close in.  Pfc. Ibay, Pfc. Cruz, and Pfc. Arimbuyutan
came and arrested the accused.  Pfc.
Ibay recovered from the accused the marked bills<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
while Pfc. Cruz received the marijuana from Pfc. Mamac.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter the accused was brought to <span style="">their
</span>office for investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Maj. Marlene Salangad, a forensic chemist of the PC Crime
Laboratory at Camp Olivas, San Fernando, Pampanga, examined the plastic bags (Exhibits
"A" and "B") and found the contents thereof to be positive
for marijuana, a prohibited drug.  Her
findings are contained in Technical Report No. NB-303-90.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused claimed that he was framed.  According to him, at about 3:00 p.m. of 12
June 1990, while he was resting inside his house, two men, whom he later
identified as Pfc. Cruz and Pfc. Ibay, called out his name.  Thinking that they were interested buyers of
wood carvings, the accused asked them what they wanted to purchase.  The two replied that their manager, who was
waiting inside the car, wanted to see him.  When he approached the car, he noticed that all the men inside it were
armed with guns.  The accused wanted to
retreat but Peter Hernandez, a NARCOM agent, went out of the car and embraced
him while Pfc. Danilo Cruz placed the marijuana in the back pocket of the
accused’s short pants.  Pfc. Mamac
employed force in arresting him.  He tried
to free himself but in vain; there were people already watching them.  At that moment, his older brother, Ronaldo,
approached them and asked what was going on but the NARCOM agents warned him
not to intervene.  The accused was
advised by the NARCOM agents to go with them to avoid a scandal.  He was brought to their office at the San
Nicolas Market and was locked up inside the detention cell.  The following day, he was brought to the
city jail.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
His brother, Ronaldo, corroborated his story.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Pfc. Danilo Cruz declared that he did not fetch the
accused from his house on 19 June 1990 and stressed that he was a member of the
back-up team whose only role was to arrest the accused if he would attempt to
escape.  The marijuana was sold to Pfc.
Mamac, the poseur-buyer, and was not placed in the pocket of the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 July 1991, the trial court promulgated its decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 14 June 1991, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime described and penalized under Sec. 4, Art. II of R.A. 6425,
otherwise known as Dangerous Drugs Act as amended, he is hereby sentenced to
suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00.  The marijuana subject matter of this case is
hereby confiscated in favor of the government and ordered sent to the Dangerous
Drugs Board for proper disposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED. <span style="">“</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused seasonably appealed from the judgment to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Appellant’s Brief,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> the
accused raised this lone assignment of error:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"THE </span>TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN
CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE SERIOUS CRIME CHARGED AGAINST HIM BY TOTALLY
THROWING AWAY IN THIN AIR THE DEFENSE EVIDENCE WITHOUT GIVING ANY PROBATIVE
VALUE THEREFOR WHATSOEVER.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He supports this assignment of error with
two main arguments:  (1) "if the
accused were a drug pusher, he would not trade his goods in the middle of a
busy street and in front of a store where people frequently pass by,"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) the accused was merely "instructed and induced ... to go to a
certain person to buy marijuana" which he did.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused admits, however, that this evidence on inducement
"was not adduced during the presentation of defense evidence for the
justifiable reason that it was only known to the [defense] counsel through the
confession made by the accused to his wife whereby the latter informed the
defense counsel only after the promulgation of the questioned decision."
His counsel expresses his regrets that he "could [not] reduce that
information into writing" as supporting evidence because "the wife
and the three young children of the accused are now living somewhere in Bulacan
[and] could no longer be contacted, their whereabouts unknown."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the accused further speculates that if only "the
said vital piece of information was introduced during the trial, it could have
most probably led to the acquittal of the accused" for as a matter of fact
"the presiding Judge ... perhaps believing in the innocence of the
accused, or bothered by her conscience of having convicted him and that there
might have been a serious miscarriage of justice if not rectified, through the
Court Interpreter, (Mr. Cristino Naguiat) contacted the [defense counsel]
calling his attention to immediately file a Motion for Reconsideration on her
own decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In amplification of the first argument, counsel for the accused
makes a sweeping attack on the law enforcers charging that they are "more
often the law breakers"; that "more often than not arresting a
suspected drug pusher, is the easiest way of earning a living at the expense of
the government and the erosion of the people’s faith in the legal
process"; and that if Generals, as recently exposed by Senator Tito Sotto
and confirmed by Col. Ramsey Ocampo, the incumbent Chief of the NARCOM, are
involved in drug trafficking, then "the ordinary agents can also do
it."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
He then concludes that he is "morally convinced that the accused is
innocent of the serious crime that he is in [sic] convicted for.  Otherwise, he could have entered into a plea
bargaining to allow the accused to enter a plea of guilty to a lesser offense
of Sec. 8 or Sec. 13 if possible.  But
the accused when informed thereof he emphatically told his counsel that he
never did it."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the instant appeal to be unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us begin with the belatedly raised issue of inducement.  We are called upon to reverse a decision on
the basis of alleged facts which were never presented in evidence.  Counsel knew, or ought to know, that the
Rules of Court expressly provide that the court shall consider no evidence
which has not been formally offered and that, as regards the testimony of a
witness, the offer must be made at the time the witness is called to testify.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming for the sake of argument that the so-called vital piece of
evidence was discovered by the counsel for the accused immediately after the
promulgation and before the decision became final, it does not qualify as newly
discovered evidence which could be a ground for a new trial under Section 2(b),
Rule 121 of the Rules of Court.  The
requisites for newly discovered evidence as a ground for new trial are:  (1) the evidence was discovered after the
trial; (2) such evidence could not have been discovered and produced at the
trial even with the exercise of reasonable diligence; and (3) the evidence is
material and not merely cumulative, corroborative, or impeaching, and is of
such weight that, if admitted, it will probably change the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the light of the accused’s own representation, the first requisite is already
lacking.  If indeed he was induced to
commit the crime by the policemen, then the evidence on this matter was known
to him even before he was arraigned or, at the latest, during the trial.  Yet he did not disclose this fact to his
defense counsel for the formulation of the defense strategy or for
plea-bargaining, as contemplated by the defense counsel.  Instead, he claimed under oath that he was
framed by the police.  Whatever was in
the mind of the accused, the fact remains that the claimed evidence could have
been discovered and produced during the trial since the most competent witness
therefor was the accused himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense counsel admits that the source of his information that
the accused was merely "induced" is the latter’s wife to whom the
accused "confessed." Clearly then, even if she were to testify
thereon, her testimony would be <u>hearsay</u>.  Hence, although it is not merely cumulative, corroborative, or
impeaching evidence, it would, nevertheless, be inadmissible or of little
probative value and would not change the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the deliberate failure of the counsel to state
that the accused would be willing to testify as to that piece of evidence and
the former’s intimation that it would be the accused’s wife who would have
testified thereon, nothing is clearer than that either the accused is not
prepared to admit having falsely testified or the wife never confided to the
counsel the alleged confession of the accused.  Counsel then should have refrained from presenting to this Court a
preposterous contention.  His claim that
the trial judge, perhaps bothered by her erroneous conviction, got in touch
with him, through the court interpreter, to suggest the filing of a motion for
reconsideration is equally strange for the records disclose that the judge
peremptorily denied the counsel’s urgent motion for extension of time to file a
motion for reconsideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We now take up the first argument that if indeed the accused were
a drug pusher, he would not sell marijuana to a stranger at a public place and
in full view of other people.  This
Court has already ruled in a number of cases that in real life, small-quantity
or retail drug pushers sell their prohibited wares to customers who have the
money to pay for the drug, be they strangers or not; what matters is not an
existing familiarity between the buyer and the seller but their agreement and
the acts constituting the sale and delivery of the prohibited drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court also said that drug pushing, when done on a small level, belongs to
that class of crimes which may be committed at any time and at any place.  After the offer to buy is accepted and the
exchange is made, the illegal transaction is completed, the whole deal taking
only a few minutes.  That the parties
are in a public place and in the presence of other people may not always
discourage them from pursuing their illegal trade -- these factors may even
serve to camouflage the transaction.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this Court has sustained the convictions of drug pushers caught selling
illegal drugs in a billiard hall,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> in
front of a store,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
along a street at 1:45 p.m.,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> and
in front of a house.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced beyond doubt that what took place in this case
was an entrapment, an effective method of apprehending drug peddlers.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The positive testimonies of the NARCOM agents in this case, against whom no
improper or ulterior motive was established, deserve full faith and
credit.  No proof to the contrary having
been made, they are presumed to have regularly performed their duties.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
The sweeping accusation made by the counsel for the accused against the law
enforcers is unfounded, if not irresponsible, since he offered no proof
whatsoever in support of his allegations.</p>
