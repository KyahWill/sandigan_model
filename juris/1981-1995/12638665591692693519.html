<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution's version
of the case follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 7, 1985 at
around one o'clock in the afternoon, Josephine Blanco, who was then fifteen
years old, single, and a third year high school student, was walking alone on a
pathway in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabangaran</span>,
San </span><span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
while on her way to attend her <span style="">classes
at the San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> High School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Passing by a tamarind tree, where
accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Warlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabro</span>
</span><span style="">was </span>then hiding, the
latter, armed with an eighteen-inch bolo, suddenly held her hands and pulled
her to a <span style="">nearby secluded and forested
area where she was ordered by <span class="SpellE">Warlito</span> to undress and
lie down or else be </span>killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
she shouted, he immediately covered her <span style="">mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fearful of <span class="SpellE">Warlito's</span>
threat, Josephine had no choice but to obey his orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then went on top of her, embraced her,
kissed her, and ravished her twice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the second intercourse, she told him she had to urinate and, after
pretending to do so, stood up and ran as fast as she could, completely naked,
towards her house where she immediately recounted her ordeal to her brother <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>, and her father Lorenzo (TSN, October 21, 1986, pp.
3-9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lorenzo then ordered his sons, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> and Romeo, to look for the Accused-appellant at the
crime scene but the latter </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">no longer there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lorenzo then went to the police authorities
to report the incident and to seek assistance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Advised by the police to submit Josephine to a medical examination (TSN,
October 21, 1986, pp. 20-22), Lorenzo then took her to the Municipal Health
Officer of San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following were the latter's<o:p></o:p></span></p>

saw Josephine walk by and when she saw him she remarked that he was
"rude" ("<span class="SpellE">Ukinnam</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bastos</span>
ka").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered Josephine </span>by
<span style="">saying "Will you come near me and
I want </span>to <span style="">show you how rude am
I" (<span class="SpellE">Ipakitak</span> <span class="SpellE">kenka</span> <span class="SpellE">ti</span> <span class="SpellE">kinabastos</span> </span><span class="SpellE">ko</span>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josephine
"responded" positively to his "invitation" and he then took
her to a "<span class="SpellE">camachili</span> tree" where she removed
her clothes and sat down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then
inserted his two fingers in her vagina twice after which he told her to put her
clothes on and go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josephine stood
up and ran away "without any clothes" on (TSN, February 19, 1987, pp.
<span style="">36-43).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Trial Court rejected
the foregoing version of the defense as "too fantastic and utterly
incredible to be believed," "inherently improbable, inconsistent with
human experience and against the natural course of things," and
"contrary to reason and common sense" (Records, p. 140).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It considered the prosecution version as
"more in conformity with experience and the natural course of things under
the often repeated doctrine that no woman especially </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">15-year-old, single, rural lass, would
willingly expose herself to the embarrassment of </span><span style="">a </span>public <span style="">trial wherein she would have not only to admit but to narrate the
violation </span>of <span style="">her person as in
the instant case" (ibid., pp. 139-140).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Conviction was thus meted
out by the Court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE
FOREGOING, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
aggravating circumstance since the bolo allegedly used by the accused was not
presented, nor mitigating circumstance, the accused is hereby sentenced to
suffer the penalty of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span>in
accordance with law (Art. 63 and 335 of the Revised Penal Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused is further ordered to pay
Josephine Blanco an indemnity of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000.00) and the
costs of this suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (Decision, pp.
6-7, Records, pp. 140-141).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the attendant
facts, the elements of Rape are indubitably present, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of
a woman, and 2) that such act is accomplished with the use of force and
intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quoted below is an excerpt
from Josephine's testimony attesting to the concurrence of those requisites:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Josephine's testimony is firm, categorical, and <span style="">straight-forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dastardly act perpetrated on her had
compelled her to run home, stark naked, in fear and sheer desperation, just so
she could escape the evil clutches of Accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no indication whatsoever that she
had any ill motive in filing the rape charge considering that Accused-appellant
is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">complete stranger to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has consistently held that the
testimony of a rape victim is credible where she </span>has no <span style="">motive to testify against the accused (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Esquillo</span>, </span>G.<span style="">R. No. 71311, March 31, 1989, 171 SCRA 571).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The absence of
"injuries in external parts of the genital and other parts of
(Josephine's) body" upon medical </span>examination (Exhibit B, Records,
p. 3) does not disprove the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape
may be committed even if no physical force had been used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intimidation is sufficient and this includes
the moral kind such as the fear engendered by <span style="">threatening an innocent teenager with an 18-inch bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant kept the bolo pointed at
Josephine as he abused her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fear is
sufficient to terrify a 15-year-old into inaction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Hortillano</span>, G.R. No. 71116, September 19, 1989, 177 SCRA
729).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The force used need not be
irresistible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices that it be
present as long as it brings the desired result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All consideration of whether it was more or
less irresistible is beside the </span>point <span style="">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Momo</span>, 56 Phil. 86 [1931]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Josephine's conduct
immediately after the assault on her person also inspires belief beyond doubt
that, indeed, she was the victim of Accused-appellant's lust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conduct of the woman immediately
following the alleged assault is of utmost importance as tending to establish
the truth or falsity of the charge of rape (People v. Garcia, et al., G.R. Nos.
L-45280-81, </span><st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="6"><span style="">June 11, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, 105 SCRA 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial Court aptly put it:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> It must be noted that immediately after she
was abused she reacted to what is expected of one who is a victim of a heinous
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of her traumatic experience
she even cast aside her shame to run home naked and upon reaching home reported
to her brother and father what happened to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same afternoon, she and her father and even her brothers on the
order of her father began to look for the malefactor only to be discovered
later that the culprit was already in the custody of the police authorities of
San <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There at the police headquarters, the
complainant identified the accused as the one responsible of deflowering
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Important, likewise, is her
submission for medical examination just few hours after the incident with the
result that she was indeed sexually assaulted" (Decision, pp. 5-6;
Records, pp. 139-140).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find apropos the observation in a host of cases that the
traditional modesty of the Filipina, specially, a young and innocent country
girl, would deter her from filing <span style="">a </span>complaint for rape and suffering the
torment if not the ignominy of having to testify in a Court of justice if in
truth she had not been really raped (People v. <span class="SpellE">Sacabin</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">are not persuaded by Accused-appellant's
story that Josephine voluntarily "acceded" to his

defense that the complainant voluntarily went with him upon his invitation to
prove his rudeness, then undressed herself without being forced and/or
intimidated after which she sat down and the accused inserted his two fingers
in her vagina for two times is too fantastic and utterly incredible to be
believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contrary to reason and
common sense (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Saylan</span>, 130 SCRA 1591).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is inherently improbable, inconsistent
with human experience and against the natural course of things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In short, the story of the accused may be likened to a
man cornered with no option but to try to minimize if possible his liability in
the light of the situation where he is in." (Decision, pp. 5-6, Records,
p. 140).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The penalty of </span><u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> <span style="">imposed
by the Trial Court is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
contrary to the Trial Court's opinion, the bolo need not be presented to
establish an aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, the use of a deadly weapon
immediately calls for the penalty of </span><u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> <span style="">to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But with the abolition of capital
punishment, it is </span><u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
<span style="">that should be imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>fine, the evidence on record convincingly measures up to the yardstick
established by law to </span>support <span style="">conviction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED, with
the modification that the payable indemnity <span style="">is </span>increased to P30,000.00 consistent with current case
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Warlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabro</span>.</p>
