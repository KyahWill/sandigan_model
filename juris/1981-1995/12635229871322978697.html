In Criminal Case No. 150 of the Court of First Instance of Samar, the 
accused-appellant Rafael Serna together with Antonio Cipriano were 
charged with the crime of Robbery with Double Homicide, allegedly 
committed as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about the 28th day of November, 1970, at nighttime, 
in the Municipality of Catbalogan, Province of Samar, Philippines, and 
within in the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping one 
another, with intent to gain, and by means of force, violence against 
and intimidation of persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, 
feloniously and forcibly take, steal and carry away with them money in 
cash amounting to Eighty (P80.00) Pesos, from the hands of Romualdo 
Villones, belonging to him and one Leonardo Carlos, while said Romualdo 
Villones was paying for the fish they bought from a fisherman, to the 
damage and prejudice of the said owners in the aforementioned sum of 
P80.00, Philippine currency; that on the occasion of the said robbery 
and for the purpose of enabling them to take, steal and carry away with 
them the said amount, herein accused, in pursuance of their conspiracy, 
with treachery and intent to kill, did then and there willfully, 
unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab several times said 
Romualdo Villones and Loneardo Carlos with a dagger and a bolo with 
which the said accused had conveniently provided themselves for the 
purpose, thereby inflicting upon said Romualdo Vil­lones and Leonardo 
Carlos several injuries on their bodies, which injuries caused their 
death. </p>
    <p> That in the commission of the crime, the aggravating 
circumstance that it was committed with the use of a motorized banca as a
 means for the flight or concealment of the offenders and also the 
aggravating circumstance of recidivism, as regards accused Rafael V. 
Serna, were present, the latter having been previously convicted by 
final judgment in the Court of First Instance of Manila, and was 
sentenced to an imprisonment from Ten (10) years to Seventeen (17) years
 in 1958."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Upon arraignment, appellant Rafael Serna and co-accused Antonio Cipriano
 pleaded guilty to the crime charged.  Both invoked the mitigating 
circumstance of plea of guilty.  Immediately thereafter, the court 
rendered judgment convicting the two accused of robbery with double 
homicide, the dispositive portion of which reads, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds Rafael V. Serna and Antonio O. 
Cipriano guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principals of the consummated
 crime of Robbery with double Homicide defined and penalized under 
Article 294, paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal Code, and considering the
 mitigating circumstance of plea of guilty in favor of the accused 
Antonio O. Cipriano and the aggravating circumstance of the use of a 
motorized banca to offset the same, hereby sentences Antonio O. Cipriano
 to <em>Reclusion Perpetua</em> and with respect to the accused Rafael 
V. Serna, considering the two aggravating circumstances against him, 
namely, recidivism and use of a motorized banca in the commission of the
 crime, one of which is offset by the mitigating circumstance of plea of
 guilty, hereby sentences Rafael V. Serna to death.  Both accused shall 
suffer the accessory penalties provided by law and to pay the heirs of 
Romualdo Villones in the amount of P12,000.00 and the heirs of Leonardo 
Carlos in another sum of P12,000.00 plus P80.00 as indemnities.  x x x

  <p>
    Death penalty having been imposed on Rafael V. Serna, the Clerk of 
Court shall, pursuant to the Rules of Court, transmit this case to the 
Honorable Supreme Court.
  </p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thereupon, this case was elevated to the Court for automatic review of the death penalty imposed on the defendant-appellant.
</p><p>
The records of this case show that after the in­formation was read to 
the appellant in English and translated in Samar dialect, the appellant 
pleaded guilty.  Thereafter, the Fiscal asked that the plea of guilty be
 considered mitigating, at the same time, the Fiscal asked the Court to 
consider two aggravating circumstances against the accused Serna.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
Without explaining the import of the plea of guilty and calling 
witnesses to convince itself of the culpability of the 
accused-appellant, the court rendered judgment convicting the 
accused-appellant Serna and imposing upon him the supreme penalty of 
death.  The trial judge did not even bother to ask appellant whether he 
understood his plea as the transcript merely stated that after the 
information was read in English and translated to the Samar dialect, 
appellant pleaded guilty.
</p><p>
Considering that the appellant was charged with an offense punishable by
 death, the trial court should have required the prosecution to present 
its evidence to prove the extent of his culpability.  The taking of such
 testimony is the prudent and proper course to follow for the purpose of
 establishing not only the guilt but also the precise culpability of the
 defendant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Where a plea of guilty is entered by the defendant, in cases where the 
capital penalty may be imposed, the court should make certain that 
defendant fully understands the nature of the charge preferred against 
him and the character of the punishment provided by law before it is 
imposed.  The trial court should therefore call witnesses for the 
purposes of establishing the guilt and degree of culpability of the 
defendant, not only to satisfy the trial judge, but also to aid the 
Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly 
understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and 
consequences of his plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment under automatic review is hereby SET ASIDE and 
the case REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings.
SO ORDERED.

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
AQUINO, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I dissent with due deference to Mr. Justice Concepcion Jr.
</p><p>
The trial court convicted Rafael V. Serna and Antonio O. Cipriano of 
robbery with double homicide because of their plea of guilty.  It 
sentenced Cipriano to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.  He did not appeal.
</p><p>
It sentenced Serna to death on the assumption that recidivism and use of
 a motorized banca were aggravating.  As admitted by the Solicitor 
General, recidivism is not aggravating because the information does not 
allege the prior crime for which Serna was convicted.
</p><p>
The Solicitor General also admits that use of motorized banca is not 
aggravating because it was used as means of flight, not as a means for 
the commission of the crime.  He says that treachery is generic 
aggravating but then it is offset by plea of guilty.
</p><p>
The fact that there was more than one homicide should not be aggravating
 because that circumstance is not mentioned in article 14 of the Revised
 Penal Code.
</p><p>
So, the Solicitor General recommends that Serna be punished with <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
</p><p>
There was no improvident plea because Serna understood the consequences 
of his plea.  The rule is stated in People vs. Palupe, 69 Phil. 703, 
705:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Cuando un acusado admite libre y voluntariamente su delito con 
pleno conocimiento de la indole exacta del mismo, su admisión, o mejor 
dicho, su confesión, hecha en dichas circunstancias, es suficiente para 
justificar la imposición de la pena que para dicho delito hay prescrita 
por la ley. </p>
  <p> "Es discrecional en los juzgados permitir la presentación de 
pruebas adicionales después que el acusado haya confesado formalmente su
 delito. </p>
  <p> "Tan sólo es prudente y necesario tal vez, requerir la 
presentación de otras pruebas además de las que el mismo acusado 
suministra mediante su confesión libre y voluntaria, cuando hay un ásomo
 de duda de que al hacerla, no la hace estando bien impuesto de los 
verdaderos hechos, y de las conse­cuencias de su acto." (See People vs. 
Duaban, L-31912, August 24, 1979, 92 SCRA 743.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the instant case, the offense was committed in <em>1970</em>.  After 14 years,<em> no purpose would be served in remanding the case to the lower court for the pre­sentation of the prosecution's evidence.</em>
</p><p>
Serna should be sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
