				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Esquillo</span>
was charged before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 102, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, with the crime of
rape in a criminal complaint filed by the victim, Dahlia P. Castro, dated <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint reads:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the 17th day of October, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">1983, in </span><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Philippines, the
said accused, by means of violence and intimidation, did, then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual
intercourse with the undersigned DAHLIA CASTRO Y PINGUL, without the consent
and against the will of the latter, to her damage and prejudice in such amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">as </span>maybe awarded to her under the
provisions of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">New </span>Civil
Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"CONTRARY TO LAW."</span> (p. 35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General has summarized the facts of the case as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On October 17, 1983, at about 4:00 p.m., Dahlia P. Castro, a
schizophrenic patient, was in the clinic of Dr. Robert Walter <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the UST Hospital for her monthly
check-up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Feb. 15, 1984, p. 3)
While there, Dahlia unwittingly slipped away from her companions (her mother
and brother) and wandered about alone in the city streets until she got lost
(TSN, Dec. 12, 1983, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
walking, she noticed that somebody was following her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She looked back and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">saw </span>that it was the accused (Ibid, p.
10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, without any provoca­tion,
the accused grabbed and pulled her, forc­ing her to go with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dahlia cried out for help but to no avail
(Ibid, p. 11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She re­sisted from the
clutches of the accused but he boxed her several times whenever she strug­gled
(Ibid, p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frightened and weak,
Dahlia could no longer keep up a fight until the accused succeeded in bodily
handling her and forcing her inside a house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused gave her a drink after which she felt dizzy and fell <span class="GramE">asleep</span> (Ibid, p.11)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Taking advantage of Dahlia's unconscious state, the accused
ravished her (Ibid, p. 11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Dahlia
woke up the following morning (Oct. 18, 1983), she was raped again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She shouted and cried for help when she saw
the accused insert his penis into her vagina, but no one was there to hear her
pleas (Ibid, p. 12).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When they left, the accused forced Dahlia inside a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (TSN, Jan. 11, 1984, p. 10) and he brought her to
another house where he raped her again several times (Ibid, p. 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dahlia constantly struggled but her attempts
to resist were met by blows on her face and body (Ibid, p. 10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime later, they departed and both ended up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">near </span>the vicinity of <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Quiapo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>underpass at about 8:30 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there, Cpl. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Dalumpines</span>
(Policeman, Western Police District) spotted them arguing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Dalumpines</span> approached them and
asked them why they were fighting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Dahlia answered that she did not know this man (the accused) who was
forcing her to go with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid, p. 5)
Hence, <span class="SpellE">Dalumpines</span> took Dahlia and the accused inside
the police station for investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From here they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">were </span>indorsed
to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Police, it appearing that the
latter had jurisdiction over the crime (Ibid, p. 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was detained but Dahlia was
released.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"Dahlia then wandered
around by herself until her mother <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and </span>brother
found her the following day at 12:15 a.m., in front of Luzon Restaurant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Feb. 14, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">1984, </span>p. 4) Dahlia informed them what happened to her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and </span>they proceeded to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Quezon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>City Police <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Station </span>where Patrolman Edmund Rivera <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">took down </span>the statements of Dahlia and
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">her </span>brother (TSN, Jan. 5, 1984,
p. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Rivera likewise
investigated the accused and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">took </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">down his </span>extra-judicial statement which
was read to him before he signed it. <span class="GramE">(TSN, March 19, 1984, p.

Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, on November 7, 1983, the<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> accused </span>pleaded not guilty to the charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Trial ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant admits having picked up Dahlia P. Castro at the <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> Underpass and taking <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">her </span>to his home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He,
however, denies the charge of rape and claims he left Dahlia <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>mother, went to his brother's
house elsewhere <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and upon </span>returning
home, decided to bring Dahlia to her residence in Project 7, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City but they were apprehended while on a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1984, the trial court promulgated <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its </span>decision finding the accused
guilty of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Cesar <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Esquillo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span>y <span class="SpellE">Albanilla</span>, <u>guilty</u> beyond <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">reasonable </span>doubt of the crime of <u>rape</u>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and pursuant </span>to Art. 335 of the

</span>345), and to pay the costs." <span class="GramE">(p. 82, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Orig. </span>Records).</span> </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the above decision, the accused interposes
this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant claims that the trial court committed the
following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN ADMITTING
APPELLANT'S SWORN STATEMENT AS EVIDENCE AGAINST <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">HIM;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="text-indent:.9pt">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN GIVING CREDENCE
TO THE TESTIMONY OF COMPLAINANT;</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">THAT ACCUSED </span>COMMITTED
THE CRIME CHARGED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(p. 1, Appellant's Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first assigned error, the accused-appellant contends that
his sworn statement should be held inad­missible against him inasmuch as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">same </span>was made without the presence and
assistance of his counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span>appellant on this
point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the amend­ment in the Bill
of Rights of the Constitution, parti­cularly with reference to the rights of
the accused, a discussion of the absence or presence of force, intimi­dation or
duress in extra-judicial confessions has become academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Art. 3, Sec. 12 of the 1987 Constitution
specifically provides that the rights of the accused, among them the right to
counsel, cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of counsel
(People v. Pineda and Garcia, G.R. No. 72400, Jan. 15, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Newman</u>
(G.R. No. 45354, July 26, 1988), we specifically reiterated that the waiver
must be made <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the presence of
counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, even without the questioned extra-judicial <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">confession, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">evidence </span>against the accused remains
strong <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in the face </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>the proofs
presented by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The medical</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>findings of Dr. Dario L. <span class="SpellE">Gajardo</span> of the PC Crime Laboratory, for one, corroborated
the victim's assertion that the accused inflicted injuries on her when she <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">resisted </span>his sexual assaults.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The multiple con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">tusions, <span class="SpellE">ecchymosis</span>,
</span>and abrasions on various parts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">her body plus </span>the deep, healing laceration in the hymen <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">confirm the </span>testimony on the sexual
assault coupled with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, even if the
confession was set aside, the overriding evidence points to the guilt of the
appellant (People v. <span class="SpellE">Nabaluna</span>, 142 SCRA 446
[1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that the trial
court did not merely rely on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">confession
a</span>t arriving at the judgment of conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> other </span>evidence duly proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent second assigned error, the accused- appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">insists </span>that the testimony of the
complainant should not have been given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the victim's mental ailment, she was shown to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">be able </span>to perceived, make known her
perception and remember traumatic incidents, as testified to by her
psychiatrist, Dr. Walter (TSN, Jan. 11, 1984, p. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Throughout the trial, her testimony was
consistent, clear and convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony was replete with details and showed she was coherent while on the
stand and could<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">
</span>clearly recall the traumatic event she experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court was convinced from the
testimony and other corroborative evidence that the accused was guilty beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason for
us to reverse this finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant has likewise failed to show any ill motive
which could induce the victim to charge him with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">such a crime </span>as rape when he himself has <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">stated that he took </span>pity on the girl so that she was bathed,
clothed, and fed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even a mentally ill
person <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">would have remembered </span>such
kindness.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Oh
the contrary, </span>she consistently pointed to the accused as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">her attacker </span>even
when asked on different occasions.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has consistently held that the testimony of a rape
victim as to who abused her is credible where she has no motive to testify
against the accused (People v. Lopez, 141 SCRA 385 [1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no ill motive of the complainant in
filing the rape charge (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 143 SCRA
428 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the accused-appellant contends that the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">erred in </span>finding
beyond reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find the appellant's contention without
merit considering that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">his defense is </span>mainly denial and alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's brief states that he left
Dahlia with his mother in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">while he </span>went
to his brother's house in <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sleep there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>According to the trial court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">however, <span class="SpellE">Esquillo</span> </span>claims he merely went downstairs and slept
with his cousins while Dahlia was upstairs with his mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court has ruled that the appellant's
alibi cannot stand against the positive identification made by the rape victim
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Mesias</span>, Jr., 127 SCRA 792 [1984]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
denial is self-serving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Denial, if
unsubstantiated by clear and convincing evidence has no weight <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the law. </p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's argument that he took care of the victim is of no
moment as it would not make him less guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It would even tilt the balance against him on account of his having
taken advantage of the victim's mental condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant likewise contends that the victim might have been
raped during the intervening periods that she disappeared thus implying that
the injuries and the sexual assault were inflicted at some other place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This argument does not hold water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no evidence that any
other person took ad­vantage of Dahlia elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What matters is that he was positively
identified as the rapist and of the rape having been committed before her
disappearance from the police station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As aptly stated by the Solicitor General, assuming someone else raped
her during her first disappearance and before he picked her up, surely, the
accused would have noticed certain peculiar details from her bodily appearance
that some­thing untoward happened to her in which case he would have mentioned
this during trial to negate his culpa­bility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But he did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not only is the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> testimony
inconsistent on material points.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony of the other witness of the defense, who happens to be the mother of
the accused likewise showed untruthfulness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court's findings on her credibility show that the mother's
testimony was motivated only by the desire to protect her son so that she would
do anything to ensure his acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the court ordered her temporary exclu­sion from the courtroom, the
mother stood up but still lingered inside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the accused failed to present other witnesses such
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>cousin whom he said were
with them in the house.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed judgment finding the accused
guilty <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">beyond </span>reasonable doubt
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">hereby </span>AFFIRMED with the
MODIFICATION that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">aggrieved party
is ordered indemnified in </span>the sum of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
