its answer to the petition, respondent admits the fact of publication of said

Respondent further argues that assuming that the services advertised are legal

are essentially without substantial distinction. For who could deny that
document search, evidence gathering, assistance to layman in need of basic

Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) does not wish to make issue with
respondent's foreign citations. Suffice it to state that the IBP has made its
position manifest, to wit, that it strongly opposes the view espoused by
respondent (to the effect that today it is alright to advertise one's legal
services).</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The
IBP accordingly declares in no uncertain terms its opposition to respondent's
act of establishing a "legal clinic" and of concomitantly advertising
the same through newspaper publications.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The
IBP would therefore invoke the administrative supervision of this Honorable

that respondent corporation is being operated by lawyers and that it renders
legal services.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">While
the respondent repeatedly denies that it offers legal services to the public,
the advertisements in question give the impression that respondent is offering
legal services. The Petition in fact simply assumes this to be so, as earlier
mentioned, apparently because this (is) the effect that the advertisements have
on the reading public.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">The
impression created by the advertisements in question can be traced, first of
all, to the very name being used by respondent - "The Legal Clinic,
Inc." Such a name, it is respectfully submitted connotes the rendering of
legal services for legal problems, just like a medical clinic connotes medical
services for medical problems. More importantly, the term "Legal
Clinic" connotes lawyers, as the term medical clinic connotes doctors.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Furthermore,
the respondent's name, as published in the advertisements subject of the
present case, appears with (the) scale(s) of justice, which all the more
reinforces the impression that it is being operated by members of the bar and
that it offers legal services. In addition, the advertisements in question
appear with a picture and name of a person being represented as a lawyer from </span></font><st1:place>Guam</st1:place>,
and this practically removes whatever doubt may still remain as to the nature
of the service or services being offered.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">It
thus becomes irrelevant whether respondent is merely offering "legal
support services" as claimed by it, or whether it offers legal services as
any lawyer actively engaged in law practice does. And it becomes unnecessary to
make a distinction between "legal services" and "legal support
services," as the respondent would have it. The advertisements in question
leave no room for doubt in the minds of the reading public that legal services
are being offered by lawyers, whether true or not.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">B.
The advertisements in question are meant to induce the performance of acts
contrary to law, morals, public order and public policy.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">It
may be conceded that, as the respondent claims, the advertisements in question
are only meant to inform the general public of the services being offered by
it. Said advertisements, however, emphasize a </span></font><st1:place>Guam</st1:place>
divorce, and any law student ought to know that under the Family Code, there is
only one instance when a foreign divorce is recognized, and that is:</blockquote>

26. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></font></p>

<p class="2Q"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Where
a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is validly celebrated and
<u>a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating
him or her to remarry</u>, the Filipino spouse shall have capacity to remarry
under Philippine Law.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
must not be forgotten, too, that the Family Code (defines) a marriage as
follows:</span></font></p>

<p class="2Q"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Article
1. Marriage is a <u>special contract of permanent union</u> between a man and a
woman entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and
family life. <u>It is the</u> <u>foundation of the family and an inviolable
social institution</u> whose nature, consequences, and incidents are governed
by law and not subject .to stipulation, except that marriage settlements may
fix the property relation during the marriage within the limits provided by
this Code.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">By
simply reading the questioned advertisements, it is obvious that the message
being conveyed is that Filipinos can avoid the legal consequences of a marriage
celebrated in accordance with our law, by simply going to </span></font><st1:place>Guam</st1:place>
for a divorce. This is not only misleading, but encourages, or serves to
induce, violation of Philippine law. At the very least, this can be considered
"the dark side" of legal practice, where certain defects in
Philippine laws are exploited for the sake of profit. At worst, this is
outright malpractice.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:54.5pt"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">Rule 1.02. - A lawyer, shall not counsel or abet
activities aimed at defiance of the law or at lessening confidence in the legal
system.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
addition, it may also be relevant to point out that advertisements such as that
shown in Annex "A" of the Petition, which contains a cartoon of a
motor vehicle with the words "Just Married" on its bumper and seems
to address those planning a "secret marriage," if not suggesting a
"secret marriage," makes light of the "special contract of
permanent union," the inviolable social institution," which is how
the Family Code describes marriage, obviously to emphasize its sanctity and
inviolability. Worse, this particular advertisement appears to encourage
marriages celebrated in secrecy, which is suggestive of immoral publication of
applications for a marriage license.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If
the article "Rx for Legal Problems" is to be reviewed, it can readily
be concluded that the above impressions one may gather from the advertisements
in question are accurate. The Sharon <span class="SpellE">Cuneta</span>-Gabby <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> example alone confirms what the advertisements
suggest. Here it can be seen that criminal acts are being encouraged or
committed (a bigamous marriage in Hong Kong or Las Vegas) with impunity simply
because the jurisdiction of Philippine courts does not extend to the place
where the, crime is committed.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Even
if it be assumed, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, (that) the "legal
support services" respondent offers do not constitute legal services as
commonly understood, the advertisements in question give the impression that
respondent corporation is being operated by 'lawyers and that it offers legal
services, as earlier discussed. Thus, the only logical consequence is that, in
the eyes of an ordinary newspaper reader, members of the bar themselves are
encouraging or inducing the performance of acts which are contrary to law,
morals, good customs and the public good, thereby destroying and demeaning the
integrity of the Bar.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
is respectfully submitted that respondent should be enjoined from causing the
publication of the advertisements in question, or any other advertisements
similar thereto. It is also submitted that respondent should be prohibited from
further performing or offering some of the services it presently offers, or, at
the very least, from offering such services to the public in general.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
IBP is aware of the fact that providing computerized legal research, electronic
data gathering, storage and retrieval, standardized legal forms, investigators
for gathering of evidence, and like services will greatly benefit the legal
profession and should not be stifled but instead encouraged. However, when the
conduct of such business by non-members of the Bar encroaches upon the practice
of law, there can be no choice but to prohibit such business.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Admittedly,
many of the services involved in the case at bar can be better performed
by-specialists in other fields, such as computer experts, who by reason of
their having devoted time and effort exclusively to such field cannot fulfill
the exacting requirements for admission to the Bar. To prohibit them from
"encroaching" upon the legal profession will deny the profession of
the great benefits and advantages of modern technology. Indeed, a lawyer using
a computer will be doing better than a lawyer using a typewriter, even if both
are (equal) in skill.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Both
the Bench and the Bar, however, should be careful not to allow or tolerate the
illegal practice of law in any form, not only for the protection of members of
the Bar but also, and more importantly, for the protection of the public.
Technological development in the profession may be encouraged without
tolerating, but instead ensuring prevention of, illegal practice.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There
might be nothing objectionable if respondent is allowed to perform all of its
services, but only if such services are made available exclusively to members
of the Bench and Bar. Respondent would then be offering technical assistance,
not legal services. Alternatively, the more difficult task of carefully
distinguishing between which service may be offered to the public in general
and which should be made available exclusively to members of the Bar may be undertaken.
This, however, may require further proceedings because of the factual
considerations involved.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
must be emphasized, however, that some of respondent's services ought to be
prohibited outright, such as acts which tend to suggest or induce celebration
abroad of marriages which are bigamous or otherwise illegal and void under
Philippine law. While respondent may not be prohibited from simply
disseminating information regarding such matters, it must be required to
include, in the information given, a disclaimer that it is not authorized to
practice law, that certain course of action may be illegal under Philippine
law, that it is not authorized or capable of rendering a legal opinion, that a
lawyer should be consulted before deciding on which course of action to take,
and that it cannot recommend any particular lawyer without subjecting itself to
possible sanctions for illegal practice of law.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If
respondent is allowed to advertise, advertising should be directed exclusively
at members of the Bar, with a clear and unmistakable disclaimer that it is not
authorized to practice law or perform legal services.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
benefits of being assisted by paralegals cannot be ignored. But nobody should
be allowed to represent himself as a "paralegal" for profit, without
such term being clearly defined by rule or regulation, and without any adequate
and effective means of regulating his activities. Also, law practice in a
corporate form may prove to be advantageous to the legal profession, but before
allowance of such practice may be considered, the corporation's Articles of
Incorporation and By-laws must conform to each and every provision of the Code
of Professional Responsibility and the Rules of Court.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Respondent
asserts that it "is not engaged in the practice of law but engaged in
giving legal support services to lawyers and laymen, through experienced
paralegals, with the use of modern computers and electronic machines"
(pars. 2 and 3, Comment). This is absurd. Unquestionably, respondent's acts of
holding out itself to the public under the trade name "The Legal Clinic,
Inc.," and soliciting employment for its enumerated services fall within
the realm of a practice which thus yields itself to the regulatory powers of
the Supreme Court. For respondent to say that it is merely engaged in paralegal
work is to ' stretch credulity. Respondent's own commercial advertisement which
announces a. certain <u>Atty. Don Parkinson</u> to be handling the fields of
law belies its pretense. From all indications, respondent "The Legal
Clinic, Inc." is offering and rendering <u>legal services</u> through its
reserve of lawyers. It has been held that the practice of law is not limited to

is apt to recall that only <u>natural persons</u> can engage in the practice of
law, and such limitation cannot be evaded by a <u>corporation</u> employing
competent lawyers to practice for it. Obviously, this is the scheme or device
by which respondent "The Legal Clinic, Inc." holds out itself to the
public and solicits employment of its legal services. It is an <u>odious
vehicle</u> for deception, especially so when the public cannot ventilate any
grievance for <u>malpractice</u> against the business conduit. Precisely, the
limitation of practice of law to persons who have been duly admitted as members
of the Bar (Sec. 1, Rule 138, Revised Rules of Court) is to subject the members
to the <u>discipline</u> of the Supreme Court. Although respondent uses its <u>business
name</u>, the persons and the lawyers who act for it are subject to court discipline.
The practice of law is not a profession open to all who wish to engage in it
nor can it be assigned to another (See 5 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
270). It is a <u>personal right</u> limited to persons who have qualified
themselves under the law. It follows that not only respondent but also all the

practice.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

That entities admittedly not engaged in the practice of law, such as management
consultancy firms or travel agencies, whether run by lawyers or not, perform
the services rendered by Respondent does not necessarily lead to the conclusion
that Respondent is not unlawfully practicing law. In the same vein, however,
the fact that the business of respondent (assuming it can be engaged in
independently of the practice of law) involves knowledge of the law does not
necessarily make respondent guilty of unlawful practice of law.</span></font></p>

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Of necessity, no one x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> acting as a consultant can
render effective service unless he is familiar with such statutes and
regulations. He must be careful not to suggest a course of conduct which the
law forbids. It seems x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
clear that (the consultant's) knowledge of the law, and his use of that
knowledge as a factor in determining what measures he shall recommend, do not
constitute the practice of law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. It is not only presumed that all men know the law, but
it is a fact that most men have considerable acquaintance with the broad
features of the law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.
Our knowledge of the law - accurate or inaccurate - moulds our conduct not only
when we are acting for ourselves, but when we are serving others. Bankers,
liquor dealers and laymen generally possess rather precise knowledge of the
laws touching their particular business or profession. A good example is the
architect, who must be familiar with zoning, building and fire prevention
codes, factory and tenement house statutes, and who draws plans and
specifications in harmony with the law. This is not practicing law.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"But
suppose the architect, asked by his client to omit a fire tower, replies that
it is required by the statute. Or the industrial relations expert cites, in
support of some measure that he recommends, a decision of the National Labor
Relations Board. Are they practicing law? In my opinion, <u>they are not,
provided no separate fee is charged for the legal advice or information, and
the legal question is subordinate and incidental to a major non-legal problem</u>.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"<u>It
is largely a matter of degree and of custom</u>.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"If
it were usual for one intending to erect a building on his land to engage a
lawyer to advise him and the architect in respect to the building code and the
like, then an architect who performed this function would probably be considered
to be trespassing on territory reserved for licensed attorneys. Likewise, if
the industrial relations field had been pre-empted by lawyers, or custom placed
a lawyer always at the elbow of the lay personnel man. But this is not the
case. The most important body of industrial relations experts are the officers
and business agents of the labor unions and few of them are lawyers. Among the
larger corporate employers, it has been the practice for some years to delegate
special responsibility in employee matters to a management group chosen for
their practical knowledge and skill in such matters, and without regard to
legal training or lack of it. More recently, consultants like the defendant
have tendered to the smaller employers the same service that the larger
employers get from their own specialized staff.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"The
handling of industrial relations is growing into a recognized profession for
which appropriate courses are offered by our leading universities. The court
should be very cautious about declaring [that] a widespread, well-established
method of conducting business is unlawful, or that the considerable class of
men who customarily perform a certain function have no right to do so, or that
the technical education given by our schools cannot be used by the graduates in
their business.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><u><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">“In
determining whether a man is practicing law we should consider his work for any
particular client or customer, as a whole</span></font></u>. I can imagine
defendant being engaged primarily to advise as to the law defining his client's
obligations to his employees, to guide his client along the path charted by
law. This, of course, would be the practice of the law. But such is not the
fact in the case before me. Defendant's primary efforts are along economic and
psychological lines. The law only provides the frame within which he must work,
just as the zoning code limits the kind of building the architect may plan. <u>The
incidental legal advice or information defendant may give, does not transform
his activities into the practice of law. Let me add that if, even as a minor
feature of his work, he performed services which are customarily reserved to
members of the bar, he would be practicing law</u>. For instance, if as part of
a welfare program, he drew employees wills.</blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"Another
branch of defendant's work is the representation of the employer in the
adjustment of grievances and in collective bargaining, with or without a
mediator. This is not per se the practice of law. Anyone may use an agent for
negotiations and may select an agent particularly skilled in the subject under
discussion, and the person appointed is free to accept the employment whether
or not he is a member of the bar. Here, however, there may be an exception
where the business turns on a question of law. Most real estate sales are negotiated
by brokers who are not lawyers. But if the value of the land depends on a
disputed right-of-way and the principal role of the negotiator is to assess the
probable outcome of the dispute and persuade the opposite party to the same
opinion, then it may be that only a lawyer can accept the assignment. Or if a
controversy between an employer and his men grows from differing
interpretations of a contract, or of a statute, it is quite likely that
defendant should not handle it. But I need not reach a definite conclusion
here, since the situation is not presented by the proofs.</span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"Defendant

before such agency. The State of </span></font><st1:state><st1:place>New Jersey</st1:place></st1:state>

In the present case, the Legal Clinic appears to render wedding services (See
Annex "A", Petition). Services on routine, straightforward marriages,
like securing a marriage license, and making arrangements with a priest or a
judge, may not constitute practice of law. However, if the problem is as complicated
as that described in "Rx for Legal Problems" on the Sharon <span class="SpellE">Cuneta</span>-Gabby <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>-Richard

non-lawyer, such as the Legal Clinic, renders such services, then it is engaged
in the unauthorized practice of law.</span></font></p>

The Legal Clinic also appears to give information on divorce, absence,
annulment of marriage and visas (See Annexes "A" and "B",
Petition). Purely giving informational materials may not constitute practice of
law. The business is similar to that of a bookstore where the customer buys
materials on the subject and determines by himself what courses of action to
take.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
is not entirely improbable, however, that aside from purely giving information,
the Legal Clinic's paralegals may apply the law to the particular problem of
the client, and give legal advice. Such would constitute unauthorized practice

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"It
cannot be claimed that the publication of a legal text which purports to say

<span class="SpellE">x</span> Apparently it is urged that the conjoining of these

advice on common problems, and does not purport to give personal advice on a
specific problem peculiar to a designated or readily identified person.
Similarly the defendant's publication does not purport to give personal advice
on a specific problem peculiar, to a designated or readily identified person in
a particular situation - in the publication and sale of the kits, such
publication and sale did not constitute the unlawful practice of law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x. There being no legal impediment under the statute to
the sale of the kit, there was no proper basis for the injunction against
defendant maintaining an office for the purpose of selling to persons seeking a

writings relating to matrimonial law or the prohibition in the memorandum of
modification of the judgment against defendant having an interest in any
publishing house publishing his manuscript on divorce and against his having
any personal contact with any prospective purchaser. <u>The record does fully
support, however, the finding that for the charge of $75 or $100 for the kit,
the defendant gave legal advice in the course of personal contacts concerning
particular problems which might arise in the preparation and presentation of
the purchaser's asserted matrimonial cause of action or pursuit of other legal
remedies and assistance in the preparation of necessary documents (The
injunction therefore sought to) enjoin conduct constituting the practice of

court proceedings, they are always subject to become involved in litigation.
They require in many aspects a high degree of legal skill, a wide experience
with men and affairs, and great capacity for adaptation to difficult and
complex situations. These customary functions of an attorney or counselor at
law bear an intimate relation to the administration of justice by the courts.
No valid distinction, so far as concerns the question set forth in the order,
can be drawn between that part of the work of the lawyer which involves
appearance in court and that part which involves advice and drafting of
instruments in his office. It is of importance to the welfare of the public
that these manifold customary functions be performed by persons possessed of
adequate learning and skill, of sound moral character, and acting at all times
under the heavy trust obligations to clients which rests upon all attorneys.

"practice of law."</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The

records or certifications, obtaining documentation like clearances, passports,
local or foreign visas; giving information about laws of other countries that
they may find useful, like foreign divorce, marriage or adoption laws that they
can avail of preparatory to emigration to that foreign country, and other
matters that do not involve representation of clients in court; designing and
installing computer systems, programs, or software for the efficient management
of law offices, corporate legal departments, courts, and other entities engaged
in dispensing or administering legal services."</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">While
some of the services being offered by respondent corporation merely involve
mechanical and technical know-how, such as the installation of computer systems
and programs for the efficient management of law offices, or the
computerization of research aids and materials, these will not suffice to justify
an exception to the general rule.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">What
is palpably clear is that respondent corporation gives out legal information to
laymen and lawyers. Its contention that such function is non-advisory and
non-diagnostic is more apparent than real. In providing information, for
example, about foreign laws on marriage, divorce and adoption, it strains the
credulity of this Court that all that respondent corporation will simply do is
look for the law, furnish a copy thereof to the client, and stop there as if it
were merely a bookstore. With its attorneys and so called paralegals, it will
necessarily have to explain to the client the intricacies of the law and advise
him or her on the proper course of action to be taken as may be provided for by
said law. That is what its advertisements represent and for which services it
will consequently charge and be paid. That activity falls squarely within the
jurisprudential definition of "practice of law." Such a conclusion
will not be altered by the fact that respondent corporation does not represent
clients in court since law practice, as the weight of authority holds, is not
limited merely to court appearances but extends to legal research, giving legal
advice, contract drafting, and so forth.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
aforesaid conclusion is further strengthened by an article published in the </span></font><st1:date year="1991" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1991</st1:date> issue of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Starweek</u></span><u>/The Sunday Magazine of the Philippine
Star</u>, entitled "Rx for Legal Problems," where an insight into the
structure, main purpose and operations of respondent corporation was given by
its own "proprietor," Atty. Rogelio P. Nogales:</p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">This
is the kind of business that is transacted everyday at The Legal Clinic, with
offices on the seventh floor of the </span></font><st1:place><st1:placename>Victoria</st1:placename>

No matter what the client's problem, and even if it is as complicated as the <span class="SpellE">Cuneta-Concepcion</span> domestic situation, Atty. Nogales and his
staff of lawyers, who, like doctors, are "specialists" in various
fields, can take care of it. The Legal Clinic, Inc. has specialists in taxation
and criminal law, medico-legal problems, labor, litigation and family law.
These specialists are backed up by a battery of paralegals, <span class="SpellE">counsellors</span>
and attorneys.</p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Atty.
Nogales set up The Legal Clinic in 1984. Inspired by the trend in the medical
field toward specialization, it caters to clients who cannot afford the
services of the big law firms.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
Legal Clinic has regular and walk-in clients. "When they come, we start by
analyzing the problem. That's what doctors do also. They ask you how you
contracted what's bothering you, they take your temperature, they observe you
for the symptoms, and so on. That's how we operate, too. And once the problem
has been categorized, then it's referred to one of our specialists."</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There
are cases which do not, in medical terms, require surgery or, follow-up
treatment. These The Legal Clinic disposes of in a matter of minutes.
"Things like preparing a simple deed of sale or an affidavit of loss can
be taken care of by our staff or, if this were a hospital, the residents or the
interns. We can take care of these matters on a while you wait basis. Again,

diarrhea," explains Atty. Nogales.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Those
cases which require more extensive "treatment" are dealt with
accordingly. "If you had a rich relative who died and named you her sole
heir, and you stand to inherit millions of pesos of property, we would refer
you to a specialist in taxation. There would be real estate taxes and arrears
which would need to be put in order, and your relative is even taxed by the
state for the right to transfer her property, and only a specialist in taxation
would be properly trained to deal with that problem. Now, if there were other heirs
contesting your rich relative's will, then you would need a litigator, who
knows how to arrange the problem for presentation in court, and gather evidence
to support the case."</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The practice of law is not a lawful business except for members of the bar who
have complied with all the conditions required by statute and the rules of

attainments previously acquired through education and study, have been
recognized by the courts as possessing profound knowledge of legal science
entitling them to advise, counsel with, protect, or defend the rights, claims,

Prior to the adoption of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Canons of
Professional Ethics had also warned that lawyers should not resort to indirect
advertisements for professional employment, such as furnishing or inspiring
newspaper comments, or procuring his photograph to be published in connection
with causes in which the lawyer has been or is engaged or concerning the manner
of their conduct, the magnitude of the interest involved, the importance of the
lawyer's position, and all other like self-laudation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
standards of the legal profession condemn the lawyer's advertisement, of his

The proscription against advertising of legal services or solicitation of legal

profession.

was held to constitute improper advertising or solicitation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
pertinent part of the decision therein reads:</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
is undeniable that the advertisement in question was a flagrant violation by
the respondent of the ethics of his profession, it being a brazen solicitation
of business from the public. Section 25 of Rule 127 expressly provides among
other things that "the practice of soliciting cases at law for the purpose
of gain, either personally or thru paid agents or brokers, constitutes
malpractice." It is highly unethical for an attorney to advertise his
talents or skill as a merchant advertises his wares. Law is a profession and
not a trade. The lawyer degrades himself and his profession who stoops to and
adopts the practices of mercantilism by advertising his services or offering
them to the public. As a member of the bar, he defiles the temple of justice
with mercenary activities as the money-changers of old defiled the </span></font><st1:place><st1:placetype>temple</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Jehovah</st1:placename></st1:place>. "The most worthy
and effective advertisement possible, even for a young lawyer, * * * is the
establishment of a well-merited reputation for professional capacity and
fidelity to trust. This cannot be forced but must be the outcome of character
and conduct." (Canon 27, Code of Ethics.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We
repeat, the canons of the profession tell us that the best advertising possible
for a lawyer is a well-merited reputation for professional capacity and
fidelity to trust, which must be earned as the outcome of character and
conduct. Good and efficient service to a client as well as to the community has
a way of publicizing itself and catching public attention. That publicity is a
normal by-product of effective service which is right and proper. A good and
reputable lawyer needs no artificial stimulus to generate it and to magnify his
success. He easily sees the difference between a normal by-product of able
service and the unwholesome result of propaganda.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Of
course, not all types of advertising or solicitation are prohibited. The canons
of the profession enumerate exceptions to the rule against advertising or
solicitation and define the extent to which they may be undertaken. The exceptions
are of two broad categories, namely, those which are expressly allowed and
those which are necessarily implied from the restrictions.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
first of such exceptions is the publication in reputable law lists, in a manner
consistent, with the standards of conduct imposed by the canons, of brief
biographical and informative data. "Such data must not be misleading and
may include only a statement of the lawyer's name and the names of his
professional associates; addresses, telephone numbers, cable addresses;
branches of law practiced; date and place of birth and admission to the bar;
schools attended with dates of graduation, degrees and other educational
distinction; public or quasi-public offices; posts of honor; legal authorships;
legal teaching positions; membership and offices in bar associations and
committees thereof, in legal and scientific societies and legal fraternities;
the fact of listings in other reputable law lists; the names and addresses of
references; and, with their written consent, the names of clients regularly
represented."</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
law list must be a reputable law list published primarily for that purpose; it
cannot be a mere supplemental feature of a paper, magazine, trade journal or
periodical which is published principally for other purposes. For that reason,
a lawyer may not properly publish his brief biographical and informative data
in a daily paper, magazine, trade journal or society program. Nor may a lawyer
permit his name to be published in a law list the conduct, management or
contents of which are calculated or likely to deceive or injure the public or
the bar, or to lower the dignity or standing of the profession.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
use of an ordinary simple professional card is also permitted. The card may
contain only a statement of his name, the name of the law firm which he is
connected with, address, telephone number and special branch of law practiced.
The publication of a simple announcement of the opening of a law firm or of
changes in the partnership, associates, firm name or office address, being for
the convenience of the profession, is not objectionable. He may likewise have
his name listed in a telephone directory but not under a designation of special
branch of law.</span></font><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Verily,
taking into consideration the nature and contents of the advertisements for
which respondent is being taken to task, which even includes a quotation of the
fees charged by said respondent corporation for services rendered, we find and
so hold that the same definitely do not and conclusively cannot fall under any
of the above-mentioned exceptions.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
ruling in the case of <u>Bates, et al. vs. State Bar of </u></span></font><st1:state><st1:place><u>Arizona</u></st1:place></st1:state>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></font></sup></span></a>
which is repeatedly invoked and constitutes the justification relied upon by
respondent, is obviously not applicable to the case at bar. Foremost is the
fact that the disciplinary rule involved in said case explicitly allows a
lawyer, as an exception to the prohibition against advertisements by lawyers,
to publish a statement of legal fees for an initial consultation or the
availability upon request of a written schedule of fees or an estimate of the
fee to be charged for the specific services. No such exception is provided for,
expressly or impliedly, whether in our former Canons of Professional Ethics or
the present Code of Professional Responsibility. Besides, even the disciplinary
rule in the Bates case contains a proviso that the exceptions stated therein
are "not applicable in any state unless and until it is implemented by
such authority in that state."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup><font face="Arial" color="red" size="1"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

This goes to show that an exception to the general rule, such as that being
invoked by herein respondent, can be made only if and when the canons expressly
provide for such an exception. Otherwise, the prohibition stands, as in the
case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Secondly,
it is our firm belief that with the present situation of our legal and judicial
systems, to allow the publication of advertisements of the kind used by respondent

the legal profession whose integrity has consistently been under attack lately
by media and the community in general. At this point in time, it is of utmost
importance in the face of such negative, even if unfair, criticisms at times,
to adopt and maintain that level of professional conduct which is beyond

to the legal profession.</span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In

we deem it necessary that the question as to the legality or illegality of the

the present proceeding which is merely administrative in nature. It is, of
course, imperative that this matter be promptly determined, albeit in a
different proceeding and forum, since, under the present state of our law and
jurisprudence, a corporation cannot be organized for or engage in the practice
