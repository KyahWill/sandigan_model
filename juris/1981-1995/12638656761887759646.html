-- which judgment, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, required

<p class="BODY">According to <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, at the hearing on
December 15, 1980 of her aforesaid motion to transmit record on appeal and
other papers to the Court of Appeals, respondent Judge <i style="">verbally approved</i><span style=""> </span>the

she filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1980</st1:date>

be held in contempt of court for having thus far refused to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings, the Court of Appeals denied <span class="SpellE">Echaus's</span> motion for lack of merit, by Resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1981</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It observed that "there was no <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> or
deliberate refusal to comply with the decision ** dated February 18,
1980;" that what respondent Judge had been commanded to do by the decision
was that he "should ** proceed to give due course to the appeal by
considering and acting" thereon, but immediate transmittal of said record
could not be compelled in the premises "because the correctness or
accuracy ** (thereof) should be first passed upon and certified by the court <i style="">a quo</i><span style="">," </span>even if there were no opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court also pointed out that deferment of
approval of the record on appeal had been ordered by the Trial Judge in keeping
"with the proper and orderly procedure to the end that all pending
incidents ** before him be first resolved ** in order that said <span style="">incidents </span>be not rendered moot and
academic by the approval of said ** record on appeal;" and that, citing <span class="SpellE">Laurilla</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Uichangco</span>, et al.,
104 Phil. 171 -</p>

<blockquote>"A verbal order or a mere notation in the minutes of the
calendar of the court a quo ** indicating approval of the ** record on appeal
is, in our view, not yet the ultimate and requisite formal order of approval of
said record on appeal that would divest the court a quo of its jurisdiction to
act on pending incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even a written
order approving <span style="">a </span>record on
appeal may still be subject to a motion for reconsideration of an opposing
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a written order which has not
acquired finality may still be reconsidered by the court, with more reason can
respondent judge modify his verbal order that has not been implemented nor even
made known to the other party in the <span class="GramE">case.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court of Appeals finally resolved
that "as the motion for execution pending appeal is conceded to have been
filed by the plaintiffs before the court below had approved (but only verbally)
petitioner's record on appeal, the court <i style="">a

retained its jurisdiction to resolve the pending motion for execution pending
appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> subsequently asked the Court of
Appeals to reconsider the Resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But

further reason or cause for withholding his resolution on the petitioner's
record on appeal or such other pleadings and orders as may be necessary for the
perfection of petitioner's appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
upon the formal approval of the record on appeal the case can be transmitted to
this Court, in compliance with the judgment rendered in this case that the
petitioner's appeal be given due course.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All these, respondent judge is strongly urged to act upon with promptness
and dispatch."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These Resolutions -- of <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1981</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1981</st1:date>
--­ are challenged in the appellate proceeding at bar, initiated by petition
for review on <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>presented
by <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this Court, <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> argues that it
was reversible error for the Court of Appeals to have "ignored the fact
that ** (her) appeal had in fact been perfected when the Trial Judge (verbally)
ordered the record on appeal approved on December 15, 1980 and, in the light of
the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Cabilao</span>
et al. v. Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>,
17 SCRA 992, any further action on the part of the Trial Judge in the case,
particularly on respondent spouses' motion for execution pending appeal is null
and void."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is patently without merit and is here given short
shrift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In line with the fundamental
principles set forth in the opening paragraph of this opinion, the oral order
approving the record on appeal had no juridical existence; to give it that
existence it had to be reduced to writing and promulgated (i.e., filed with the
clerk of court).<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
But even if it had been written and promulgated, indeed even if it had already
been properly served on the parties, it nonetheless was yet plainly within the
power of the Judge to recall it and set it aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For every court has the inherent power, among
others, to "amend and control its process and orders so as to make them
conformable to law and justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
And this Court has had occasion to rule that a trial court may set aside its
order approving a record on appeal prior to the transmittal of the record.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
So, even conceding <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">arguendo</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>efficacy
to the oral order approving <span class="SpellE">Echaus's</span> record on
appeal, the respondent Judge nevertheless had the power to recall said order,
or, as he actually did, hold approval thereof in abeyance until after h<span style="">e had resolved other pending incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court thus perceives no error on the
part of the Appellate Court in giving its <i style="">imprimatur</i><span style=""> </span>to that act of the respondent Judge
in the light of the attendant circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To all intents and purposes, <span class="SpellE">Echaus's</span>
record on appeal had never been approved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, the doctrine prevailing at the time was that prior to the approval
of the record on appeal, the Trial Court retained jurisdiction to grant
execution pending appeal, that approval being in fact the operative act
denoting the end of the court's power to grant execution pending appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge, therefore, cannot be deemed to have acted without or in
excess of his jurisdiction, or to have gravely abused his discretion, in
deferring action on the record on appeal so that he might first resolve the
motion for execution pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, as is by now known to all, the rules for taking an
appeal to the Court of Appeals, and for execution pending appeal have since
