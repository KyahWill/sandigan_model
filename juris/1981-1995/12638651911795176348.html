				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases involve a 900 sq. m. parcel of public land which
the petitioner had purchased from Luis Peggy on September 14, 1966 (thinking it
belonged to the latter) but which the actual occupant, respondent Ernesto
Reyes, had applied to purchase <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">from </span>the
Government under a miscellaneous sales application filed by him in the Bureau
of Lands in September, 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 18, 1966, Plaza filed an action (Civil Case No. 1128
of the Court of First Instance of Agusan Del Norte in Butuan City) to recover
the land from Reyes.  The trial court
rendered judgment on December 5, 1973, ordering Reyes to vacate the land, to
pay Plaza P300 as monthly rental beginning October 1966 with legal interest,
until the property is actually <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vacated,
plus P5,000 as moral damages, and P5,000 </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">attorneys fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the administrative proceedings in the Bureau of
Lands, where Plaza opposed Reyes’ miscellaneous sales application
("Ernesto C. Reyes, applicant-appellant vs. Figurado O. Plaza, claimant?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appellee [MSA (VII-a) 171]; DANR Case No.
3546”), the Regional Land Officer of Region No. </span>VII, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Director of Lands and the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources unanimously found that the subject land is </span>public
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">land; and that Reyes was only a tenant
of the petitioner whose preferential right to purchase said land the
aforementioned officials recognized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, upon Reyes’ appeal to the Office of the President, the
latter reversed on February 11, 1975 (OP Decision No. 1328, s. 1975), the
ruling of the Director of Lands and the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources that Reyes was a mere tenant of the land.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaza filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
in this Court (G. R. No. L­-42782) to annul the decision of the Office of the
President for grave abuse of discretion in totally <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">disregarding the decision of the Court of First Instance of Agusan Del
Norte <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>Civil Case No. 1128
finding Reyes to </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a mere
lessee of the land in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Reyes appealed the decision in Civil Case No.
1128 of the Court of First Instance of Agusan Del Norte to the Court of Appeals
(CA-G.R. No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">56694-R, entitled
"Figurado O. Plaza, plaintiff-appellee versus Ernesto C. Reyes, defendant?appellant").  The Court of </span>Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deferred to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the presidential </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decision
in favor of Reyes in the administrative case and dismissed Plaza's action.  The dispositive part of its decision dated
September 6, 1977 reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"IN VIEW WHEREOF, this Court is constrained to sustain
Error 5, and to declare that by failure of appellee to institute proceedings to

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals made the following observations:</p>

12.0pt">already bound by that result, it was binding against him, the question
of who of the protagonists was entitled to the sale of the land from the
government has been settled, it was not appellee, Plaza, but appellant Reyes,
and the necessary implication must have to be that Reyes should not be
disturbed in his possession,- this being the true situation, this present case
has become academic; if only to add something more, this Court might as well
mention that the position of Plaza had been that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY">In due time, Plaza filed a petition for review in this Court
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (G.R. No. L-47936).  As the subject matter, the private<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> parties, and the issues in this petition for
review are the same as those in the <i>certiorari</i> case (G.R. No. L-42782),
the two cases were consolidated.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The legal question presented by this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i> (G.R. No. L-42782) is whether the Office of
the President may modify, revoke or totally disregard the decision of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Court of First Instance in the </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">accion publiciana</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filed
by Plaza against Reyes (Civil Case </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">No.
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1128) which was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">already pending </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appeal in the Court of Appeals when the
Office of the President issued its assailed decision in favor of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Reyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the Office of the President has no authority
to reverse, set aside, or nullify a decision of a court of first instance on a
matter that is within the court's jurisdiction, or to render moot and academic
an appeal pending in the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">That contention is not well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The land in question is public land.  Its administration, disposition and alienation is lodged in the
Director of Lands subject to the control of the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources as alter ego of the President (Secs. 3, 4 and 5, Commonwealth
Act 141).  The President, through the
Executive<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Secretary, may review,
affirm, reverse, or modify the orders and decisions of the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (Extensive Enterprises Corp. vs. Sarbio &amp;
Co., Inc., et al., 17 SCRA 41).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The disposition of public land is an executive, not a judicial,
function.  The decision of the court of
first instance in the action for recovery of possession filed by Plaza against
Reyes did not bind nor bar the Office of the President from exercising its
power as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the final authority in the
disposition of lands of the public domain.  For one thing, the decision of the court of first instance was not yet
final when the Office of the President decided the miscellaneous sales applications
of Reyes and Plaza.  Furthermore, the
administrative case was instituted ahead of Civil Case No. 1128.  Reyes filed his Miscellaneous Sales</span>
Application No. 460-A on September 28, 1966 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">while </span>Civil Case 1128 was filed by Plaza on November 18, 1966
only.  Plaza should have exhausted his
administrative remedies before going to court.  Having failed to do so, his recourse to the courts was premature.  The dismissal of his complaint by the Court
of Appeals was proper <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(Cruz </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vs. </span>Del
