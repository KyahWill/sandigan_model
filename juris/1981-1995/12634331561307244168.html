109, dated December 22, 1989 issued in Criminal Case No. 86-9252-P entitled
“People of the Philippines v. Alejandro William, et al.“ the dispositive
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“In view of all the foregoing, the Court finds accused Romulo
Calogcog y Quiban and Alejandro William y Banega guilty beyond reasonable doubt
for Violation of Section 4, Republic Act 6425 as amended and hereby sentences
them to Reclusion Perpetua and to pay a fine of TWENTY THOUSAND (P20,000.00)
PESOS each without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“For insufficiency of evidence and on grounds of reasonable doubt,
accused Benjamin Samia y Martinez and Virgilio Apura y Ferraren are hereby
acquitted of the charges against them considering that the g<span style="">overnment witnesses testified that the two
(2) accused Virgilio Apura and Benjamin Samia are mere onlookers (usyosos) at
the place of the operation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The stuff of marijuana is hereby <span style="">ordered forfeited in favor of </span>the government and the Officer in
charge of this Court is ordered to transmit the same to the Dangerous Drugs
Board thru the National Bureau of Investigation for proper disposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.” (p. 66, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants were charged with the violation of Section
4 of Republic Act 6425 as amended (The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) in an
Information filed by the Pasay City Fiscal’s Office, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the 18th day of January, 1986, in Pasay City, Philippines
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused,
considering and confederating together and mutually helping one another without
authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
sell, give away to another, deliver, distribute or act as a broker in the sale
transaction of marijuana, a prohibited drug.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Contrary to law.” (p. 57, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All pleaded “not guilty”, when arraigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">For the <span style="">p</span>rosecution,
four (4) witnesses were presented, namely:  Pat. Cenon Parungao, Pfc. Manuel <span style="">Olivas,
Lt. Rolando Puruganan and P/Lt. Tita Advincula, who testified:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“That sometime in January 1986, the NARCOM conducted a surveillance
at the Starlight Disco at Pasay City based on informations (sic) received that
drug push­ers <span style="">are roaming around the
said place.  </span>That accordingly a
team consisting of three (3) members with Lt. Puruganan as team leader was
formed and surveillance was started two (2) weeks before the actual date of
operation.  That on January 18, 1986 one
member of the team Pfc. Manuel Olivas posed as tourist guide with a U.S. Navy
as tourist proceeded to the coffee shop at Starlight Disco.  That one of the suspects Romeo Calogcog
approached the group who in loud <span style="">conversations
made known the fact that </span>they have a client, buyer of the dope, offering
to contact person who has the stuff of marijuana which they offered to buy at
P200.00.  That Romulo Calogcog left and
returned with one Alejandro William who owned the marijuana.  That accordingly, the amount of P200.00 was
paid to the two (2) suspects as payment for the marijuana stuff.  That after the marijuana was delivered to
Pfc. Olivas and the payment of P200.00 was received by Alejandro William, both
were arrested by the team.  That Samia
and Apura arrived after Alejandro William has already delivered the marijuana
and received payments thereof.  That the
two (2) were in the place making ‘usyoso’.  That they also <span style="">talked with Apura
and Samia and also suspected them as pushers.  That both accused Alejandro William and Romulo </span>Calogcog were
identified by members of the buy-bust team as the ones who sold the
marijuana.  That they also identified
Apura and Samia.  That all were arrested
and investigated at the NARCOM Office.  That the marijuana bought from Alejandro William and <span style="">Romulo Calogcog were submitted to the PCCL
for forensic examination.  A receipt for
the seized article was prepared and signed by the suspect.  That the members of the team executed a
Joint Affidavit of Arrest</span> detailing the circumstances leading to the
arrest.  That the signatures thereon are
that of the team members.  That after
the required forensic examination of the stuff sold by the accused Alejandro
William and Romulo Calogcog were found to be positive for the presence of
marijuana.  That they noticed the
presence of Apura and Samia after William has handed them the prohibited
stuff.  That because Apura and <span style="">Samia were there making ‘usyoso’, they
included them in the arrest least (sic) they </span>may have knowledge of the
transaction.  That Apura and Samia were
allowed to go home.” (pp. 58-59, Rollo).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented all the accused-appellants except Alejandro
William who jumped bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Romulo Calogcog, testified:   That on January 18, 1986, at around 8:30 a.m., while on duty as a
watch-your-car boy at the Starlight Disco located at corner San Luis Service
Road, Roxas Boulevard, two (2) persons approached him <span style="">and </span>asked him if he knows something about marijuana to which he
answered in the negative; that the two men left but after a little while he was
arrested and brought together with the other three (3) accused inside a Hi-ace
van then with William brought to the Beach View hotel inside <span style="">a </span>bathroom and was asked for money but
answered <span style="">in </span>the negative; that
for four (4) hours thereafter he was made as temporary helper; that thereafter
he was brought to Camp Crame together with the other three (3) accused and with
several others; locked inside - they were made to sign documents without
letting them read the same and without a lawyer’s assistance; that they were
then brought to the City Fiscal’s Office of Pasay, that he denied the charge
versus him and upon cross examination denied all the testimonies of the
defense; and that the officers who arrested him were not the ones who brought
him to the hotel, that he knew the other three accused only by face.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Virgilio Apura, when called to the witness stand,
testified that at around 9:30 p.m. of January 18, 1986 he was alone eating
“lugaw” near the service road corner San Luis St., Pasay City with other
people; that he noticed three persons conversing with one another, but one left
and returned after some ten minutes, that again the three talked to one
another; that after he paid for the “lugaw”, two persons held the back of his
pants and arrested him who introduced themselves as NARCOM agents, that he was
brought inside a Hi-ace and to the Bayview Plaza; that he noticed there were
less than nine persons inside the van, that two persons sitting beside him were
brought to the second floor while he was left behind; “that he does not know
the identities of the other two co-accused; that together with Samia or
“tatang” he was sent home because they were only making “usyoso”; that they
boarded a jeep and returned to the place where they were first arrested because
they <span style="">lived </span>there, that again,
the NARCOM agents invited them again for some explanation, they were again
brought to the Bayview Plaza Hotel and he was slapped twice when he denied any
knowledge of marijuana, and he was boxed also on the chest upon repeated
answers of denials to their similar questions; that they stayed there for four
minutes, brought to Camp Crame and placed inside a small cell on the charge of
confiscated marijuana but from whom it was confiscated, there was no <span style="">mention; </span>that they stayed in Camp
Crame for five, (5) days; that he did not give any statement which he claimed
as his right, that he only came to know William for the first time at Camp
Crame; that he did not know the reason why he and Samia were left inside <span style="">the van </span>while Calogcog and William
were brought inside the Bayview Plaza.  On cross examination, Apura said that although Samia owns a small eatery
near his place of residence it was only the wife who manages the store whom he
sees there and never Samia; that he never knew Calogcog and William before the
incident; that while eating “lugaw” be actually saw not only three (3) persons
but five (5); that he did not hear them talking about marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Benjamin Samia testified that on January 18, 1986, when
he was at the store at around 8:00 and 8:30 p.m., there were three (3) persons
eating and he sat down beside them waiting for them to finish eating; that
after 10 minutes, somebody approached him and invited him to a nearby van where
there were seven other persons; that he was brought to the beach with four (4)
others; that upon reaching the hotel, nothing was asked of him but the two whom
he later on knew to be Calogcog and William were brought upstairs; that after some
time, he was told to go home as he was only an “usyosero”.  On cross examination he said that he did not
know any case calling for his invitation and arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-Appellants assigned two (2) errors, thus:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->The trial court gravely erred in giving credence to the
testimonies of the law enforcers who are accordingly presumed to be regularly
performing their duties in the absence of proof to the contrary; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="" times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->The trial court seriously erred in considering that the
evidences submitted are indeed the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u> of the crime in
the absence of convincing proof to that effect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We will tackle the first assigned error.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must pay attention to the fact that drug addiction is one of
the most pernicious evils that have ever crept into our society.  More often than not it is the young who
constitute the greater majority of the citizenry who are the victims.  It is of common knowledge that drug addicts
become useless if not dangerous members of society and in some instances turn
out to be among the living dead.  This
is the reason why courts and law enforcement agencies should continue in their
relentless campaign not merely to minimize but to totally eradicate the evil
before it is too late.  And everyone
must be involved in this drive if we are to succeed.  The peddlers of drugs are actually agents of destruction.  (Peo v. Policarpio, 158 SCRA 85)<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, we should not close our eyes to reports of
evidence being planted on unwary persons either for extorting money or exacting
personal vengeance.  By the very nature
of anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of
shady characters as informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or
grams of heroin can be planted in pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial
hicks and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility
of abuse is great.  Courts must also be
extra vigilant in trying drug charges lest an innocent person is made to suffer
the unusually severe penalties for drug offenses (Pee v. Ale 145 SCRA 50).</p>

<p class="BODY">What transpired was a buy-bust operation of the NARCOM people
inevitably preceded by careful planning which consists of weeks of surveillance
and tense sleuthings.  There is nothing
in the records of the case suggesting that the testimonies of the NARCOM agents
were motivated by any reason other than the mission to curb drug abuse.  (People v. Labriaga, 199 SCRA 530).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, a buy-bust operation is the method employed by
peace officers to trap and catch malefactors in <u>flagrante</u> <u>delicto</u>.
  It is essentially a form of entrapment
since the peace officer neither instigates nor induces the accused to commit a
crime.  Entrapment is the employment of
such ways <span style="">and means </span>for the
purpose of trapping or capturing a lawbreaker from whose mind the criminal
intent originated.  Oftentimes it is the
only effective way of apprehending a criminal in the act of the commission of
the offense.  The NARCOM agents in this
case used entrapment to be able to catch the accused-appellants in that
act.  The fact that they had a ready
supply belies their claim of instigation.  (Peo v. dela Cruz, 18 April, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">While the appellants’ attempt to discredit the testimony of said
police officers, they have not shown any improper motive why they should
testify in the manner that they did.  Thus their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credence.  They are presumed to be in the regular
performance of official duties.  (Perez
v. Rumeral, 200 SCRA 194).</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, even without relying on the presumption of regularity in
the performance of the NARCOM officers’ official duties, appellants’ conviction
can be sustained on the unrebutted evidence that they were caught in <u>flagrante</u>
<u>delicto</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth reiterating that conspicuous is the fact that
accused-appellants did not impute, much less prove, any ill-motive on the part
of the NARCOM agents.  This destroys
their defense that they were framed.  In
this regard, it was held in Peo v. Agapito, 154 SCRA 694 that:</p>

<blockquote>“(i)n cases involving persons accused of being drug pushers or
sellers, almost always, the defense is that the accused was framed by the
apprehending police officers.  We
realize the disastrous consequence on the enforcement of law and order, not to
mention the well-being of society, if the courts, solely on the basis of the
policeman’s alleged rotten reputation, accept in every instance this form of
defense which can be so easily fabricated.  It is precisely for this reason that the legal presumption that official
duty has been regularly performed exists (p. 700).” (pp. 14-15, Appellee’s
Brief; p. 74, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And for someone caught red-handed peddling illicit drugs, just
like the accused-appellants, an imputation of wrongdoing allegedly committed by
Enforcement Officers, so easily fabricated, can be expected.  (Peo v. Madarang, 147 SCRA 123)</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, again, in Peo v. Rumeral, 200 SCRA 194.  We held that the commission of the offense
of illegal sale of marijuana requires merely the consummation of the selling
transaction.  What is important is that
the poseur buyer received the marijuana from the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the 2nd assigned error questioning the Court’s
consideration of the <u>corpus</u> <u>delicti</u> of the crime, this the
Solicitor General has brilliantly refuted, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The contents of the plastic cannister and the aluminum foil seized
from appellants tested positive for Marijuana.   - On the basis of her laboratory examination of objects taken from
appellants, PC forensic chemist Lt. Tita B. Advincula issued Chemistry Report
No. D-51-86 dated January 20, 1986 (Exhibit ‘D’) stating that the 3.09 grams of
suspected dried marijuana flowering tops placed in a round plastic container
with cover (Exhibit ‘I-1’) and the 0.58 gram of suspected marijuana flowering
tops wrapped in aluminum <span style="">foil </span>(Exhibit
‘I-2’) tested positive for marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When Lt. Advincula testified, she identified the specimens on
which she conducted her laboratory examination and the report she prepared
(TSN, December 22, 1986).  The fact that
she did not give details of the procedure she followed in examining the
specimens does not diminish her credibility.  She was not able to give details of the procedure she followed not
because of any inability or refusal on her part to do so but because of the
simple reason that she was not asked, whether in direct examination or cross-examination,
to do so.  She was merely called upon to
identify the report she prepared and the specimens she used.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellants point out that this Honorable Court, ‘in various
occasions,’ ruled that an expert witness, such as a forensic chemist, should
show the thorough procedures he followed to determine that the specimen is a
prohibited drug (Appellants’ Brief, p. 8).  It must be stressed that appellants failed to cite a single case
supporting this proposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Moreover, witness Advincula testified (TSN, December 22, 1986, p<span style="">. </span>3) that she used three methods of
examination in arriving at the finding contained in her preliminary report
(Exhibit ‘D’) that the specimens proved positive for marijuana.  She also prepared a Chemistry Report 2-51-86
(Exhibit ‘K’), the final report of her examination of the specimens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellants attack the credibility of Pfc. Olivas for mistakenly
identifying the chemistry report which certified that the specimens tested
positive for marijuana as Chemistry Report No. ‘D-85-186’ instead of
‘D-51-86’.  This is nitpicking.  Since Pfc. Manuel Olivas did not conduct the
laboratory examination and did not prepare the chemistry report, he was not
expected to be familiar with the same and, most certainly, to memorize its
number.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The probative value of an object evidence is not affected by the
fact that it is beyond the commerce of man.   – Appellants raise the strange argument that Exhibit ‘C’ has no
probative value because the subject thereof –marijuana– is beyond the commerce
of man.  This is simply absurd.  The transfer of marijuana was incidental to
the arrest of appellants and the confiscation of the subject matter of the
crime.  Exhibit ‘C’ is in the same category
as a death certificate and autopsy report which are admissible evidence of the
subject of the crime –the human cadaver which is also beyond the commerce of
man.  Transfer of goods as a consequence
or by virtue of police or state action such as forfeiture, seizure,
condemnation, confiscation did not fall within the phrase ‘commerce of man’
even in its broadest meaning.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Assuming that the signing of the receipt of seized goods by
appellants constituted extrajudicial confession and therefore required the
assistance of counsel, any defect or infirmity was cured or waived when appellants’
counsel.  Atty. Oscar Nudo,
categorically stated that appellants were not objecting to the admission of
Exhibit ‘C’.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Under Sec. 36, Rule 132, of the Revised Rules of Court, objections
to evidence shall be made as soon as the grounds therefor shall become
reasonably apparent.  The alleged
infirmity of Exhibit ‘C’ is the absence of counsel when appellants signed
Exhibit ‘C’.  This alleged defect was
reasonably apparent at the time Exhibit ‘C’ was introduced and at the time it
was formally offered in evidence.  It
must be stressed that appellants did not merely fail to object to said
exhibit’s admission.  They even
categorically manifested that they were not objecting to the admission of
Exhibit ‘C’.  Appellants cannot now
object to the admission of Exhibit ‘C’.  Objections to admissibility of evidence cannot be made for the first
time on appeal.” (People v. Verges, 105 SCRA 744).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The presentation of the marijuana specimens taken from appellants
and their identification by the forensic chemist constitute proof of <u>corpus</u>
<u>delicti.</u>   – <u>Corpus</u> <u>delicti</u>
simply means the fact that a crime was committed (People v. Pascual, No.
1055-R, October 10, 1947, 44 OG 2787).  In People v. Macuto, 176 SCRA 76, it was held that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘(w)hat is important is the fact that the poseur-buyer received the
marijuana from the appellant and that the contents were presented as evidence
in court.  Proof of the transaction
suffices.  The identity of the tea bag
of marijuana which constitutes the corpus delicti was established before the
court.’</p>

<blockquote>“In the case at bar, appellants were positively identified as the
sellers of goods to the NARCOM agents.  The goods were delivered by and seized from appellants.  (Exhibit C) The goods seized were tested
positive for marijuana (Exhibits <span style="">D, </span>K),
one of the drugs prohibited under Sec. 4 of the Dangerous Drugs Act.  Said marijuana and its containers were
presented in evidence (Exhibits I, I-1, I-2).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Appellants try to raise doubt as to the identity of the marijuana
by pointing to the <span style="">possibility </span>that
the objects seized from appellants may have ‘commingled’ with other NARCOM
evidence considering their massive operations on January 18, 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“This<span style=""> </span>is highly
improbable.  The Receipt for Property
Seized <span style="">(Exhibit C), </span>executed by
appellants themselves immediately following their arrest on January 18, 1986,
acknowledged the seizure of goods from them on the date indicated thereon and
described said goods as:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘A’  one (1) round plastic cannister leveled
(labeled ?) ‘Bulleye’ Magnum, containing marijuana arrox (sic) 3 grams.</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘B’  one (1) big (?) foil
containing marijuana.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Affidavit of Arrest (Exhibit A) executed by arresting officers
Pat. Parungao and Pfc. Olivas described the containers of the marijuana seized
from appellants as ‘a plastic container with a ‘Bullseye’ mark and an aluminum
foil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The request for laboratory examination executed by Major Ruperto
M. Remetre on January 19, 1986 (Exhibit J) in connection with the case
involving Virgilio Apura, appellant Alejandro William, Benjamin <span style="">Samia, and appellant Romulo Calogcog
described the specimens submitted for examination as ‘one (1) round shape
plastic container marked ‘Bullseye’ containing suspected marijuana’ and ‘one
(1) cigarette foil of suspected marijuana.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Certificate of Laboratory Result (Exhibit D) executed by
examining forensic chemist Lt. Tita Advincula described the <span style="">specimens submitted in connection with said
case as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>‘(A)’  3.09 grams of suspected dried marijuana
flowering tops placed in a round plastic container with cover.</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘(B)’  0.58 gram of suspected marijuana flowering
tops wrapped with aluminum foil.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The foregoing information matches the description contained in
Chemistry Report No. D-51-86 issued by Lt. Advincula (Exhibit K).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The specimens described in the fore­going documents were presented
in court (Exhibits I, I-1, I-2) and identified by Lt. Advincula as the
specimens submitted to her for examination in connection with appellants’ case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In view of the foregoing circumstan­ces, it is highly unlikely
that the speci­mens examined by the forensic chemist and which tested positive
for marijuana are different from those seized from appel<span style="">lants.” (pp. 25-35, Appellee’s Brief; p</span><span style="">. </span><span style="">74, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
