Decision of this Court of April 15, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span>
Perez y de la Merced, together with several others, (4 in Criminal Case No.
8286 and 8 in Criminal Case No. 8287) was charged with and prosecuted before
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in two (2) criminal cases:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> thru
Falsification of Public Documents under Criminal Case No. 8286; and (2) for
Violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft Law (RA 3019) under Criminal Case
No. 8287.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was acquitted in Criminal
Case No. 8286 but was convicted in Criminal Case No. 8287 and accordingly
sentenced to three (3) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> as minimum to six (6) years and
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as
maximum, to indemnify, jointly and severally with the other convicted
co-accused of his (supplier Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, PNR
Officials/employees Arlie Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Culang</span>, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>) the Philippine National Railways in the amount of
P43,376.00 and to pay proportionate costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, the Court affirmed the conviction of Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Arlie Cruz and herein accused-<span class="SpellE">movant</span>
<span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Perez but acquitted, on ground of reasonable
doubt, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Culang</span>, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the judgment of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>, the
Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The evidence on record shows, that such a conspiracy existed,
considering that the anomalous or irregular award, and short or under delivery
of the requisitioned items in question could not have been made possible
without the connivance of the supplier and the PNR officials/employees involved
in the transaction.</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="2Q">"But were all the petitioners part of the conspiracy so as to,
make them liable for the crime charged?</p>

<p class="2Q">"So with petitioners Arlie Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span>
Perez, officers of the Receiving and Shipping Section of the PNR <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Branch and the COA Technical Property Inspector,
respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, they were charged
with the duty to see to it that the delivery made by the supplier conformed to
the Purchase Order and Sales Invoice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet they allowed the irregularities to be committed by signing the said
forms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, petitioner Perez even
made it appear in the Inspection Report he prepared that welding rods worth P43<span class="GramE">,776.00</span> had been delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it was on the basis of the foregoing, that Disbursement Voucher No.
05102 was prepared allowing <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> to collect and
receive from the PNR the amount of P43<span class="GramE">,776.00</span> when
what was actually delivered were only 100 pieces of welding rods worth P100.00."
(pp. 221, 222-223, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Perez came back with a motion
for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that
the foregoing findings and conclusions are without any factual and/or legal
basis because there is no competent evidence to prove the existence of
conspiracy and assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that there <span class="GramE">was,</span> petitioner-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> was never a
part but in fact only a victim of that conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
argues that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> stated that the
individual acts of the accused constituted vital links in the <span class="SpellE">conspirational</span> chain leading to the consummation of the
transaction; that there were several acts and omissions which made possible the
irregular processing, pre-audit and payment of the transaction and that without
one or some of the accused having contributed their specific participation in
the onward progress of the documents evidencing and supporting the transaction,
the crime alleged to have been committed could not have prospered or been
consummated (Decision p. 104, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the persons who, granting there was
conspiracy, may have been involved - Santos, who prepared the Purchase request
which was deemed to be the cause of the irregular purchase; Prospero <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Chief of the Bidding and Canvassing Section who
prepared the Price Quotation and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tortuna</span>, Chief of the Procurement Division who
counterchecked the entries therein were not even charged and/or included among
the accused, so with <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>, the main storekeeper at
PNR <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then also <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
the Processing Agent in charge of the processing of the purchase request and
who had material part leading to the purchase of the subject welding rods, was
acquitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other accused, <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Culang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Escandor</span>, the COA/PNR
auditors who were responsible for the pre-audit examination of the Disbursement
Voucher in question were also acquitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The vital links in the "conspiratorial chain" were either not
prosecuted or were found to be guiltless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">movant</span> concludes, there being no
conspirators and no concerted acts which show community of purpose, <u>a</u> <u>fortiori</u>,
there is no conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have once again reviewed the evidence on record and <span class="GramE">We</span> find <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> arguments
well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are, therefore,
constrained to reconsider our previous judgment of conviction finding <span class="SpellE">movant</span> guilty by means of conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Movant's</span> criminal liability appeared
confined and/or merely limited to the preparation of the Inspection Report
where it was allegedly made to appear that welding rods worth P43<span class="GramE">,776.00</span> had been delivered on the basis of which
Disbursement Voucher No. 05102 was prepared thus allowing the supplier to
collect the aforesaid amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record
however shows that there is no available competent and admissible evidence,
documentary or testimonial that proves that <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
did not receive the "360 kilograms of welding rods worth P43<span class="GramE">,776.00</span>" at the receiving office of PNR <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it has been established by
the defense that the 360 kilograms of welding rods contained in 100 tubes at
3.6 kilograms each were inspected by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> upon
their receipt by the receiving clerk, Cruz, in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All were found to be in order as specified in
the purchase order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cruz's testimony on
the point is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-</span> (Perez and I) went out and
looked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We went to the <span class="SpellE">tamaraw</span>, took a tube brought it inside and verified it and
we found out that the tube weighed 3.7 <span class="SpellE">kgs</span>., Your
Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q - ... what did you do next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-</span> We went out
bringing with us the tube and . . . we allowed the driver to carry it and had
(them) counted one by one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q
- Who made the counting of that OK <span class="SpellE">Esab</span> welding rods?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-</span> The two of us, the TPI <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Perez and I." (TSN, p. 21, August 15, 1985)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the inspection thus conducted, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
prepares the Inspection Report which merely attests that he inspected the
delivery of welding rods at PNR <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> and that the
items inspected were those written therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The inspection report did not attempt to show that <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
whose office was in <span class="SpellE">Tutuban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, received the items
described therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever happened to
the welding rode from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> (where <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
allegedly received only 100 pieces) is no longer the concern of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> nor may he be made accountable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The single circumstance of preparing the
Inspection report which, as the evidence on record shows, was regular in <span class="GramE">itself,</span> is insufficient for conviction in a conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the amount or number of welding
rods were bloated or forged such that the same were more than the actual
numbers needed, this was not the fault of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> who
had no participation in their requisition and purchase, he being merely the COA
- Technical Property Inspector whose only function in this transaction is to
audit in the form of actual physical inspection the deliveries to the PNR
Stores Department at <span class="SpellE"><u>Caloocan</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The responsibility, if any, rests upon the
officials/employees of the PNR, who were either not prosecuted or who were
acquitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the required proof beyond
reasonable doubt has not been surmounted by the evidence on hand to prove the
existence of conspiracy and <span class="SpellE">movant's</span> participation
therein, the Court will not hesitate to reconsider its previous decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is settled that the same degree of proof
required for establishing the crime is required to support a finding of
conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it must be
shown to exist as clearly and convincingly as the commission of the offense
itself <span class="SpellE">inorder</span> to uphold the fundamental principle
that no one shall be found guilty of crime except upon proof beyond reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The defendant in a criminal case must always be presumed
innocent until the contrary is proven, and in case of reasonable doubt and when
his liability shall not have been satisfactorily shown he shall have the right
to be acquitted, even though his innocence be doubted (U.S. v. Gutierrez, 4
Phil. 493 cited in People v. Sadie, 149 SCRA 240, 244).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding the motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> Perez y de la Merced to be well
taken, the same is hereby granted and he is hereby ordered ACQUITTED.</p>
