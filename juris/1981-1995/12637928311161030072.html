Arbiter Manuel R. <span class="SpellE">Caday</span> found for the complainant,
the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">disp</span>ositive</span>
part of his decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED<span class="GramE">,</span> judgment is hereby
rendered declaring the respondents guilty of illegally dismissing the
complainant and ordering them to reinstate him to his former position with full
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of his dismissal on <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1984</st1:date>, until actually
reinstated without loss of seniority rights and other rights granted by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The claim for illegal deduction, overtime pay, premium pay for
holiday and rest day, underpayment of 13th month pay, unpaid wages and
commission and sick leave pay, is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There being no clear and sufficient evidence of moral damages, the
same must also be dismissed for lack of merit.</blockquote>

Commission (NLRC) composed of Ricardo C. Castro as Presiding Commissioner with
Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> T. Seno and Federico O. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> as members, set aside the Labor Arbiter's award of

thus:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Motion for reconsideration of the NLRC

was filed alleging that the NLRC had committed grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction in <span class="GramE">reversing</span> the
findings and conclusions of the labor arbiter and that there is no plain,
speedy, and adequate remedy available under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

Fiscal.</p>

went back to <st1:street><st1:address>Aberdeen Court</st1:address></st1:street>

dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the
case before the labor arbiter, on appeal to the NLRC and in the present
petition for <i>certiorari</i> is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Was <span class="SpellE">Palencia</span> dismissed or did he abandon his work?</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palencia</span></st1:place></st1:city>
insists that he was dismissed and the labor arbiter so found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC on review held otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether or not evidence adduced establishes
dismissal or abandonment raises <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a f</span>actual issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So does the first error assigned in this
petition i.e., that the NLRC "flagrantly and gravely failing (failed) to
apply petitioner's constitutional right against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the Labor Code".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
its being couched in terms which appear to raise a question of law, it involves
a careful examination of facts to determine if there is basis for the assertion
that these constitutional rights had been disregarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is neither averment <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">nor </span>evidence that at any point in the
proceedings <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palencia</span></st1:place></st1:city>
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ever </span>compelled to be a
witness against himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When at the
police investigation he invoked the right to counsel and to the right against
self-incrimination, the fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>made
of record <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
p. 92).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The assertion that the
right to due process has been violated is even more tenuous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palencia's</span> complaint
was given due course, he was afforded every opportunity to be heard, his
Memoranda and other manifestations were taken into account by the labor arbiter
and the NLRC acting under provisions of the Labor Code.</p>
