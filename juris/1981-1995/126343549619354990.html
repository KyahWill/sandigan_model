Information filed by the Office of the City Fiscal of Cebu City with the
Regional Trial Court of Cebu City on 9 February 1989, the accusatory portion of

<p class="BODY">The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. CBU-14863 and after it
was raffled off to Branch 15 of the said court, the accused were forthwith
arraigned.  Carmelina entered a plea of
not guilty while Rommel, then seventeen (17) years of age, with the conformity
of the prosecution, entered a plea of guilty to the lesser offense of
possession of marijuana under Section 8, Article II of R.A. No. 6425, as
amended.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

As a consequence of his plea, the trial court handed down on 24 April 1989 an
Order which reads in part as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Therefore this court being satisfied that the accused herein
is the same Ramil Tabar described in Annex 1 (Certificate of Birth) of the said
accused, and it appearing that he is still a minor (17 years), he is entitled

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, trial proceeded as against Carmelina alone.  The prosecution presented Pfc. Josephus
Trangia and Myrna P. Arreola, a forensic analyst of the PC Crime Laboratory
Service, as its witnesses.  The
testimony of Pfc. Raul Tumakay was ordered stricken out since he could not be
cross-examined.  The defense had only
Carmelina as its witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 December 1990, the trial court promulgated its decision,
dated 17 December 1990,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

1972 as amended by PD 1675" and sentencing her to <i>"Reclusion</i> <i>Perpetua

marijuana."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conviction is premised on the following findings of fact:</p>

<p class="2Q">"From the evidence which consists of the testimony of Pfc.
Josephus Trangia, the court gathered that at about 3:00 P.M. of February 8,
1989, he was with Pfc. Romeo Cortes and Gualberto Gabales on a buy-bust
operation for marijuana after receipt of information about marijuana pushers in
Punta Princesa, Cebu City and that they had their informant go ahead of them
after giving the P5.00 bill for him to purchase marijuana.</p>

<p class="2Q">He continued saying that their informant stood in front of a shanty
while they posted themselves at a distance of about 50 meters from the place
where their informant was standing.  And
that they saw a young boy <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">approached
their informant and </span>handed cigarettes to him who in turn handed the
marked money to the young boy.  Then,
their informant gave them the pre-arranged signal of scratching his head with
his right hand; that after the signal, he and his companions immediately
approached the young boy and the informant introduced them as police
officers.  This young boy was about
16-17 years old, by the name of Rommel Arriesgado y Tabar.  He had earlier pleaded guilty to the lesser
offense of mere possession of marijuana and was, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">fact, already </span>convicted by this court.  Upon being shown a P5.00 bill with the
initials written thereon as:  GDG-89 and
bearing SL L F 637396, he identified the same bill as the one given to their
informant and marked as Exh. "A" for the prosecution.  He explained the initials GDG which stands
for Gualberto G. Gabales, his team member.  He further declared that after the pre-arranged signal from their
informant, they immediately proceeded to the scene and were given three sticks
of marijuana by their informant after buying the same from the boy, Rommel
Arriesgado and that they proceeded to confiscate the P5.00 bill from the
boy.  At this juncture, he claimed that
he observed that after the transaction, the boy went inside the shanty and the
moment he got out, he handed the three sticks of marijuana to the
informant.  In fact, he claimed that
after proceeding to the shanty, they met Carmelina Tabar, accused herein, and
that Carmelina Tabar was holding a white pants from where they found other
marijuana sticks in cigarette packs which they confiscated.  That they brought Carmelina Tabar to Fuente
Police Station for investigation.  He
claimed that there were 75 sticks of marijuana in the Hope Cigarette pack; 22
sticks of marijuana cigarettes in the Philip Morris pack and 99 sticks of
marijuana in the Mark cigarette pack.  He said that they also confiscated the pants, but only the marijuana
sticks were submitted for testing to the PC Crime Laboratory.  That pursuant to this requested analysis,
Lieut.  Fortunato Quijon of the Police
issued a Certification of Field Test, Exh. "B" which showed that the
three sticks of handrolled cigarettes marked Rommel-89 were positive for
marijuana.  Shown the three packs of
cigarettes distinctly marked as Hope, Mark and Philip Morris, he identified the
same as the ones confiscated from Carmelina Tabar.  So did he identify the cream-colored pants he said they
confiscated from Carmelina Tabar and which according to him was used to wrap
marijuana sticks inside the pack.  He
finally told the court that this team was composed of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Gualberto D. Gabales, Romeo Cortes,
Pfc. Tumakay and himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">On
cross-examination, this witness affirmed that when he asked the boy, Rommel
where he got the marijuana sticks, he was told he got it from his aunt, the
accused herein.  He further told the
court that they arrested Rommel Tabar first and that they arrested </span>Carmelina
Tabar later.  When the young boy went
inside, they presumed the marijuana came from inside the shanty and that when
the accused Carmelina Tabar went out, suspicious-looking and pale and afraid to
face them, they told her to stop from going left towards the houses and asked
her to open the pants which revealed the three cigarette packs containing
marijuana.  The witness candidly
admitted they had no search warrant at the time they effected the arrest and
confiscation.</p>

<p class="2Q">From the testimonies of Mrs. Myrna Areola, Police Lieutenant,
Forensic Analyst of the PC Crime Laboratory, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">was </span>established that the specimens submitted to her were
positive of marijuana.  She then
identified Exh. "C", as her Chemistry Report C-038-89.  She also identified her signature, Exh.
"C-4" thereon and her findings ‘All are positive of Marijuana', Exh.
"C-3"; the specimens submitted as Exh. "C-2" and the name
of the subject, Carmelina Tabar as Exh. "C-1".  She confirmed her findings on all handrolled
cigarettes in all cigarette packs;  Hope, Exh. "E-1" to "E-75"; Philip Morris pack as
Exh. "F-1" to "F-22" and Mark cigarette pack, Exh.
"G-1" to "G-99".  She
informed the court that the specimens were submitted to her by Pfc Gabales on
February 11, 1989, at about 10:50 A.M., and that she herself typed her report,
Exh. "C"; that she examined the sticks one by one and handrolled them
again.  She also claimed that the police
did not ask for a copy of her report and that this is the first time it is
presented in court.  She informed the
court that she placed the specimens in her evidence store room, with keys, she
herself kept.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Carmelina, hereinafter referred to as the Appellant, imputes upon the trial
court the commission of the following errors in the appealed decision:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<p class="2Q">X X X IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANTS (sic) OF VIOLATION OF
SECTION 4, ARTICLE II, REPUBLIC ACT 6425 AS AMENDED WHEN THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT
WARRANT IT.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="2Q">X X X IN ADMITTING EVIDENCE SEIZED WITHOUT ANY SEARCH WARRANT."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the first assigned error, the appellant claims that the
prosecution presented no evidence that she sold marijuana and since there
exists no convincing, positive and conclusive proof of conspiracy between her
and her co-accused, Rommel Arriesgado, she cannot be held liable for violation
of Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the second assigned error, the appellant maintains
that the marijuana cigarettes seized from her are inadmissible in evidence
because they were obtained in violation of the constitutional guarantee against
unreasonable search and seizure.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful perusal of the records and evaluation of the
evidence, this Court is inclined to agree with the appellant that she should
not be convicted under Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425.  We rule, however, that she is liable under
Section 8, Article II of the said Act.  Her conviction by the trial court under Section 4 is primarily based on
its conclusion that the appellant "actually employed her nephew Rommel
Arriesgado to sell marijuana from her store and that she had been in that
illicit business for quite sometime now." This conclusion is based on the
trial court's sweeping statement that "talks in the community where the
accused lives is rife with accusations that she is indeed engaged with members
of the family, in the sale and distribution of prohibited drugs such as
marijuana." We find no evidence on record to sustain this charge.  It may thus be said that such a conclusion
is not based on established facts but on "talks in the community." If
indeed such was the fact, it would not have been difficult for the prosecution
to provide the court with overwhelming evidence.  Yet, it presented only Pat. Trangia who, rather unfortunately,
did not even testify or volunteer information that the main target of the
buy-bust operation was the appellant.  He did not also disclose in his testimony that the appellant was among
the reported "pushers" in Punta Princesa, Cebu City.  It may be recalled that the buy-bust
operation on 8 February 1989 was conducted because, as he alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"A  Before that time we have already received
information from the community of Punta Princesa regarding marijuana pushers in
that place."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Nevertheless, the prosecutor who
conducted the direct-examination of Trangia did not ask further as to the
identity of the pushers such that it was not proven that the appellant was one
of them.  The Solicitor General, however,
maintains that there was conspiracy, established by circumstantial evidence,
between accused Rommel Arriesgado who was caught <i>in </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">flagrante </span></i>selling three (3) sticks
of handrolled marijuana to the informant and accepting the marked money.  We are not persuaded since the evidence for
the prosecution does not show that (a) the appellant was in the mind of the
members of the team when they planned the buy-bust operation and when they
carried out such plan, (b) the three (3) sticks of handrolled marijuana came
from the appellant, and (c) the appellant used Rommel as her agent to sell the
three (3) sticks to the informant.  Moreover, if indeed the prosecution truly believed that such conspiracy
existed, it should not have willingly given its conformity to Rommel's plea to
the lesser offense of illegal possession of prohibited drugs under Section 8,
Article II of R.A. No. 6425, as amended.  Having been caught <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in
flagrante </span></i>for selling marijuana, it was not difficult to prove
Rommel's culpability under Section 4, Article II of the Act.  Yet it readily consented to his offer to
plead guilty to the said lesser offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was, however, established beyond any shadow of doubt and,
therefore, with moral certainty, that the appellant kept in her possession
handrolled sticks of marijuana placed in empty Hope, Philip Morris and Mark
cigarette packs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
She does not have any authority to possess them.  She may have acquired them with the intention to sell them for
profit; but without proof of sale, she cannot be held liable under Section 4,
Article II of the Dangerous Drugs Act.  For such possession, her liability is covered by Section 8 of the said
Article which penalizes <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">possession
or use of prohibited drugs.  The last
paragraph thereof reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six years and one
day to twelve years and a fine ranging from six thousand to twelve thousand

<p class="BODY">Appellant, therefore, may specifically be penalized under the
aforesaid last paragraph of Section 8, Article II of the Act.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the penalty of eight (8) years as <u>Minimum</u> to twelve (12) years as <u>Maximum</u>
and a fine of P10,000.00 may then be imposed upon her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second assigned error is without merit.  The evidence for the prosecution discloses
that the appellant placed the packs of marijuana sticks under the rolled pair
of pants which she was then carrying at the time she hurriedly left her shanty
after noticing the arrest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>Rommel.  When she was asked to spread it out, which
she voluntarily did, the package containing the packs of marijuana sticks were
thus exposed in plain view to the members of the team.  A crime was thus committed in the presence
of the policemen.  Pursuant to Section
5, Rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">113 and </span>Section 12, Rule
126 of the Revised Rules of Court, she could lawfully be arrested and searched
for anything which may be used as proof of the commission of an offense without
the corresponding arrest and search warrants.  Her own counsel on cross-examination of prosecution witness Josephus
Trangia further obtained a re-­affirmation of these facts, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
