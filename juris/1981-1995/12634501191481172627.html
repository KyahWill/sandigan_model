<p class="BODY">The first point raised in petitioner's motion for <span style="">reconsideration </span>is
that <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1981</st1:date> <span style="">is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Sec. 2(3)
of </span>Article 10 of the new Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended </span>that by Our stating in
the questioned resolution that <span style="">"the
</span><span style="">title
of </span><span class="SpellE">Samtop</span> to the property in question and its
right <span style="">of
possession thereof </span>are hereby deemed finally settled", We passed <span style="">upon the merits of </span>the
case, which petitioner contends might yet be raised by <span style="">her in </span>an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a portrayal of <span class="GramE">Our</span>
resolution <span style="">is
inaccurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did </span>not pass on
the merits of the controversy <u><span style="">per se</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>What
We did was merely to sustain the contention of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Samtop</span> that petitioner's motion for reconsideration (Annex
E of the petition) of the order of respondent judge of June 8, 1979 (Annex C of
the petition was pro-forma, hence, in effect, the judgment therein contained
reversing that of Judge <span class="SpellE">Ulpiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
of March 31, 1979 (Annex A of the petition) had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and consequently it goes even without saying that
the recognition in said order of <span class="SpellE">Samtop's</span> rights of
ownership and possession of the premises in question are "deemed"
finally settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="GramE">We</span> skipped the consideration of the merits and confined
Ourselves to the finality of the judgment, which under settled law must stand
even at the risk that it might be erroneous.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration also points out that:</p>

<blockquote>"b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Honorable Court decided to end the
controversy on the merits by a minute resolution in the instant proceedings
upon the ground that the alleged claim of private respondents that the order of
June 8, 1979 is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>' is in
its 'considered view well taken, it appearing that the motion for
reconsideration thereof of petitioner should be deemed <u>pro-forma</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But it must be noted that the alleged claim of private
respondents that the order of June 8, 1979 is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> is significantly not even an issue in the
incident at bar, hence, with due respect, petitioner feels that this Honorable
Court in ending the controversy in the main case seriously departed from its
own pronouncement in Bautista, supra.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner, therefore, humbly submits that this Honorable
Court's resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1981</st1:date>
dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and deciding at the same time the
main case should have been rendered en banc as mandated by the Constitution,
and not merely by the Second Division.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, petitioner submits likewise that this motion for
reconsideration should be decided en banc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In making the foregoing insistent but humble submission,
petitioner is not unaware of the pronouncements of this Honorable Court in <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, 82 SCRA 349,
and Velasco vs. Court of Appeals, 95 SCRA 616, regarding the inherent power of
this Honorable Court to -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'xxx do substantial justice in every case before it are inherent,
plenary and imperative, hence extensive to all instances where it appears that
final resolution of the controversy before it is feasible without denying any
of the parties involved full opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently if in any case elevated to
this Court for the correction of any supposed procedural error of any lower
court, it should be found that indeed there has been a mistake, and it further
appears that all the facts needed for a complete determination of the whole
controversy are already before the Court undisputed or <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
by the parties, the Supreme Court may at its option, whenever it feels the best
interests of justice would be thereby <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>,
dispense with the usual procedure of remanding the case to the court of origin
for its own judgment, and instead, the Supreme Court may already resolve the
pertinent determinative issues and render the final judgment on the
merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obvious reason for such an extension
in the exercise of the Court's pervasive power is that any other procedure
would amount to an unnecessary rigmarole which can only augment the expenses,
efforts and anxieties of the parties and uselessly delay the administration of
justice, no other result for <span style="">all con</span>cerned being anyway perceptible.'</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">nay</span>, even its
power to suspend its own rules <span style="">to exempt </span>a case if warranted under the
peculiar <span style="">circumstances
</span>of the case.</p>

<blockquote>"But the doctrinal precedent in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lina</span></u></span><u><span style=""> and <span style="">Velasco</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>supra, is
inapplicable to the instant case, because, petitioner respectfully <span class="GramE">submits,</span> the <span style="">parties therein </span>jointly manifested or
consented to submit the <span style="">main </span>case for decision by this Honorable Court on the merits,
although the case pending before this Honorable <span style="">Court </span>was merely an incident in the
main case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, petitioner feels that said pronounce­ments in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lina</span></u></span><u><span style=""> and Velasco</span></u><span style="">, </span>supra, cannot apply to the instant
case, because not only is the issue of whether or not the order of June 8, 1979
of respondent Judge, which reversed the decision penned by then presiding Judge
<span class="SpellE">Ulpiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> prior to
the latter's retirement, had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
not in issue in the instant incidental case but also because the parties never
jointly or separately contemplated nor intended to submit that issue before
this Honorable Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere did
respondents at any time plead for such course of action in the instant case
except in their Memorandum to which petitioner vigorously objected in her reply
memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Nor did
the petitioner.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records will
bear petitioner on this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Indeed, respondents could never raise that as an issue in
this incidental proceedings because respondent Zodiac which filed the motion to
declare judgment final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> before the lower
court had withdrawn the same as a procedural maneuver in order to pave the way
for the respondent court to resolve the petitioner's motion for reconsideration
and motion to inhibit which respondents had insistently pressed for submission
and resolution simultaneously against petitioner's plea that the motion to
inhibit be resolved first before the motion for reconsideration</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because of the foregoing humble submission that the foregoing
resolution of this Honorable Court suffers from constitutional infirmity,
insofar as it reverses or modifies in effect the doctrine in Bautista, supra,
petitioner further submits that the said resolution should have been issued en
banc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fortiori, this motion for
reconsideration challenging said resolution should be resolved en banc in
accordance with Section 2(3), Art. <span class="GramE">10 of the Constitution."</span>
(Pp. 3-6, Motion, pp. 360-363, Record)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Counsel's attention is sternly admonished that <span style="">the above-</span>quoted
portion of their motion baselessly attributes <span style="">inaccuracies </span>of fact to this Court, to
the point that they suggest that the resolution they are impugning was prepared
carelessly and without due attention to the matters on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not true for counsel to even attempt to accuse the Court of
passing over an issue not raised in the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be recalled, in this connection, that
by <span class="GramE">Our</span> resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1979</st1:date>, the Court resolved to consider the
comment of respondents of <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="9">September
 17, 1979</st1:date> as their ANSWERS (hence, they are pleadings even in the
strict legal sense).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On page 5 of said
ANSWER, the private respondents specifically raised the point that petitioner's
motion for reconsideration was pro-forma thus:</p>

<blockquote>"(15)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on July 6, 1979, Petitioner, instead of
appealing to the proper Appellate Court from the disputed Order of June 8,
1979, filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which motion by the way is <u>pro-forma</u>,
(a) having failed to point out specific portions of the Order of June 8, 1979
as supposedly contrary to the facts and the law, and (b) being merely a
reiteration of what Petitioner had asserted in her opposition (<u>Annex '3'</u>
hereof), to the Motions for Reconsideration filed by Private Respondents (<u>Annexes
'1' and '2'</u> hereof)." <span class="GramE">(Page 5 of Comment.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As admitted by counsel, the same point is reiterated in private
respondents' memorandum of <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="10">October
 23, 1979</st1:date> in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>"(37)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Differently stated, when the ground of a
Motion for Reconsideration attacks how the Decision was rendered but does not
attack the merits of the Decision, or fails to point out the law and the
jurisprudence which were supposedly violated or not applied by the Judicial
Officer, we submit that the said Motion is <u>pro-forma</u> and will not toll
the running of the period within which an appeal must be perfected.'' (Page 15,
Par. 37, Memorandum for Private Respondents.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that at the hearing held on August 8, 1979 in
the trial court, respondent Zodiac, for reasons of its own, withdrew its motion
wherein it attacked petitioner's motion as pro-forma, it must be noted that <span class="SpellE">Samtop</span> had its own opposition (Annex H of the petition
herein) where the same issue was raised; and <span class="SpellE">Samtop</span>
who was represented by another counsel does not appear to have joined Zodiac's
withdrawal.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel argues that:</p>

<blockquote>"It is significant to note that this Honorable Court decided
to give due course to the petition after it had considered the comments of the
respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to fathom that
after the first step had been <span style="">surmounted,
</span>this Honorable Court would after having given due course to the petition
dismiss the petition summarily based on the same comments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Memoranda having been submitted by the parties, petitioner
feels that the case should have been subjected to further study and then
decided in an extended decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner humbly believes that this has not been true in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the minute resolution
contains inaccurate statements giving the impression that this Honorable Court
failed to notice that the petition had already been given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More, it failed to consider that all the
respondents had been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the case upon its
own order earlier issued by it ordering the petitioner to amend the page one
(1) of the petition, so as to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the private
respondents which order had been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, petitioner respectfully submits that it was not correct for this
Honorable Court to state as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Attending to the letter of one Angela T. Samson asking for the
early resolution of this case, and acting on the petition herein, the comments
thereon of respondent judge himself, as well as the Zodiac Pharmaceutical Co.
Inc. and <span class="SpellE">Samtop</span> Investment &amp; Development
Corporation, the last two having filed their respective comments even without
having been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as parties, which they ought to
have been made, from the outset, hence the Court may consider their comments
herein as in the nature of voluntary appearances, thereby enabling the Court to
acquire jurisdiction over their persons, as well as the reply filed by
petitioner, the Court Resolved to DISMISS the petition, for lack of merit, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">because</span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1979</st1:date>, this Honorable

imputation to <u>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span></u> of certain
statements indirectly, if not directly, alleging money consideration as being

<blockquote>because undisputed is the fact that during
the hearing of the motion to inhibit on June 14, 1979, Atty. Ramon Academia
(not Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>) counsel of respondent Zodiac who
told petitioner's counsel that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If you
do not have P200,000.00 do not expect to win in our Motion for
Reconsideration,' expressed his conformity to the motion to inhibit, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'If your Honor please, I came to Court with a
prepared Manifestation more in the nature of a conformity to the motion filed
by the plaintiff to inhibit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' (T.S.N. June 14, 1979, p. 2, Annex
2 of Respondent Judge's Comment).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing admission made by a lawyer in a prepared Manifestation
more than suffices to convince the respondent Judge to inhibit himself, for no
lawyer in his right mind after deliberating over the matter (because he had a
prepared manifestation) would conform to the motion to inhibit imputing the
said statements to him, if the same were not true.'' <span class="GramE">(Pp.
7-10, Motion for Reconsideration En Banc, pp. 364-367, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, counsel must be reminded that it is not a simple matter to
accuse this Court of practically not knowing what it <span style="">is doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To </span>say, for
instance, that "(O)<span class="SpellE">bviously</span>, the minute
resolution contains inaccurate statements giving the impression that this Court
failed to notice that the petition had already been given due course" is
less than fair to the efforts exerted by the Court to review all the pertinent
portions of the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel ought to
know that even if a petition has already been given due course, it is neither
without power or authority, nor even improper for it to dispose of the case in
a minute resolution, in instances wherein its discretion dictates a reasoned
out and full-blown opinion is unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, for counsel to say that "it is not correct for this
Honorable Court to state as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">'Attending to the letter of one Angela T. Samson asking for the

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the sole original respondent in this case
was Judge Jose R. Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="GramE">We</span> issued the resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1979</st1:date> requiring comment, on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1979</st1:date>, private respondents Zodiac and <span class="SpellE">Samtop</span> filed a joint motion for extension to file their

the judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, in fact, </span>said
respondents filed their comment on September 24, 1979 (although dated September
17, 1979), and it was only on October 5, 1979 that We required them to be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>, hence there is no inaccuracy in Our statement in
the resolution of May 4, 1981 that in a sense said respondents submitted

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Counsel </span>further

them "(n<span class="GramE">)either</span> was it accurate for this
Honorable Court to state that the petition lacked merit -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="">order </span>to view their motion for
reconsideration x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'" (underscoring ours) (P.
9, Motion, p. 366, Record)</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court does not indulge in any debate
with counsel as <span style="">to the correctness or
incorrectness </span>of its holding that a petition lacks merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In many instances it does not even state the
reason for such a conclusion and all practicing lawyers are aware of this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case at bar, the Court took pains to
state why it believes the petition has no merit insofar as the move to inhibit
respondent judge is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
suffice it now to add that Atty. Federico <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>
has nobody else to blame for his adamant refusal to be put on the witness stand
in order for the trial court <span style="">to </span>have
proof in the record, with the requisite cross examination of the accuser, of
the charge that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span> had made statements
derogatory to the integrity of the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be emphasized in this connection, that the contention of counsel
that the statement of Atty. Academia during the hearing before the trial court
that he had gone thereat with a prepared manifestation withdrawing his
opposition to the motion for inhibition is indicative of the truth of counsel <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili's</span> charge is a veritable <u>non-sequitur</u>,
particularly, because Atty. Academia was pre­cisely demanding legally
admissible evidence to such effect by insisting that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>
take the witness stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, there are considerations which are taken into account but
are not stated in the pertinent resolution as decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not incumbent upon the Court to discuss
every pro and con in the pleadings and memoranda of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the instant motion for reconsideration, the Court,
after mature deliberation thereon in the light of the opposition thereto of
private respondents, the reply of petitioner and the rejoinder to said reply as
well as all relevant matters extant in the record, holds that the points raised
in said motion have already been duly taken up and considered in the formulation
of the resolution of May 4, 1981 and there is nothing new for the Court to pass
upon, except to reiterate, at this point that counsel for petitioner should in
the future be less inaccurate in his indictments against the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By and large and considering that counsel <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili's</span> broadsides may be deemed as manifestation of
excessive zeal, and, anyway, this is the first occasion he has committed such a
fault, the Court is inclined to consider reminders and admonitions above as
sufficient.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED.</p>
