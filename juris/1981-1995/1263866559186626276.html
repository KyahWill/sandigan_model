				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, Branch XIII dated July 8,
1986 setting aside the decision of the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City, Branch II in Civil Case No. 3717 (169-11).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following, in brief, are the facts of the case:</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Day is the
registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Original Certificate of Title
No. P-2667 and situated at <st1:street><st1:address>Tomas Claudio St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Go <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
is the owner of a building constructed on the said lot <span style="">occupying an area of 101 square meters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent was asked by petitioner to peacefully vacate
and remove that portion <span style="">of </span>the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> building standing on the latter’s lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to private respondent's refusal to vacate
the premises, on <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1982</st1:date>,
petitioner instituted a formal complaint against respondent with the Office of
the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Chairman, Zone I, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As no amicable settlement could be reached in
the case, the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Chairman, on <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1982</st1:date>, issued a
certification that conciliation of the dispute at the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">barangay</span></span><span style=""> level had failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(MTC Decision, Annex “A”, Petition, pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 25).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The dispute was continuously discussed by the parties through
1982, 1983, and 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1984</st1:date>, petitioner agreed
to accept P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from private respondent as rental
for the use of his lot <span style="">from 1979 to
December 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As </span><span style="">petitioner had received the P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as compensation for respondent’s use of his land,
respondent claimed the existence of a lease contract between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Go <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>,
however, failed to prove the existence of a formal or even verbal contract of
lease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner again made another demand on private respondent to remove the
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because <span style="">of </span>private respondent‘s adamant and
continued refusal to vacate the disputed lot, petitioner filed on March 25,
1985 an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> with application
for <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
petitioner Day did not use the former <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Certification in commencing the said suit against private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="4">April
 15, 1986</st1:date>, the trial court rendered <span style="">a </span>decision in favor of petitioner Day, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion reading <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing findings of facts
judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant
to remove that portion of his building which stands on the 101 square meters
over plaintiff's property; to pay plaintiff the amount of P950.00 monthly compensation
from January 1986 until <span style="">defendant
vacates the premises; to pay attorney's fees </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the sum </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs of the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant's compulsory
counterclaims are hereby ordered dismissed." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. </span>27)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1986</st1:date>,
without having first filed a motion for reconsideration, private respondent Go <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> filed an original action for <i>certiorari</i> with
respondent court, against Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabato</span> and petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pending hearing of the application for preliminary injunction, respondent
court issued a temporary restraining order in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1986</st1:date>,
<span style="">p</span><span style="">e</span>titioner filed his Answer and
Opposition to the Petition, to which private respondent filed a reply.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the application for preliminary injunction, the
parties waived further oral arguments and submitted the case based on their
pleadings and <span style="">documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date>,
respondent court issued an order resolving all the matters and issues in the
petition in favor of herein petitioner <span class="GramE">Day, that</span> the
petition on its main is “lacking in merit except that there are still certain
matters which the respondent court would <span style="">like
to resolve after hearing thereon.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 3).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The application for
preliminary injunction was likewise denied and the hearing of the main petition
was set on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="6"><span style="">June 24, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the said hearing, respondent court gave the parties opportunity to adduce
additional arguments on the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They, however, submitted the case for decision without further
arguments, relying therefore on the pleadings and documents on record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1986</st1:date>,
however, respondent court issued another order granting the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and setting aside the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabato</span> of the
Municipal Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection
therewith, <span style="">the </span><span style="">parties were directed to submit their dispute
before the <span class="SpellE">Lupong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagapayapa</span>
pursuant to the requirements of PD 1508.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1987</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following issues are presented for the court's determination:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
respondent court may modify or reverse its own order (of <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date>) after the lapse of 15 days from its
issuance;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not B.P.
129 allows the plaintiff in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case
to apply for a writ of preliminary injunction;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not prior
conciliation proceedings pursuant to P. D. 1508 is applicable to petitioner's
suit in the Municipal Trial Court;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
respondent court may entertain the petition for review on <i style="">certiorari</i> when the proper remedy is ordinary appeal;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
respondent court, in a petition for <i style="">certiorari</i>,
may entertain procedural questions or questions of facts or substance already
decided by the lower court; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
respondent court may grant a Writ of <i style="">Certiorari</i>
on grounds other than those specified under Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of
Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, petitioner maintains that the respondent
court had no jurisdiction to reverse its own <span class="GramE">order</span>
after the lapse of 15 days from its issuance because the <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date> order was a final order, all issues <span style="">in </span>the main petition having been
resolved therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said controversial
order reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Although the primary objective of this order is the determination
of whether or not to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in the instant
case, yet in the consideration <span style="">thereof,
the Court finds the main petition for <i>certiorari</i> as it appears on the
pleadings to be <u>LACKING</u> </span><u><span style="">IN
MERIT</span></u><span style="">. </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">Hence, it follows that where the petitioner </span>is
not <span style="">entitled to the primary relief
demanded, he cannot likewise be entitled to the <span class="SpellE">ancilliary</span>
remedy of injunction, because injunction is not to protect contingent or future
right or enforce an abstract right (EMILIA </span><span style="">VS. </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">RADO,
23 SCRA 1983) or to protect a right not in <span class="SpellE">esse</span>.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE">(DIZON VS.</span> <span style="">YATCO, 13
SCRA 167).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there are </span><u><span style="">STILL</span></u><span style=""> <u>CERTAIN</u> <u>MATTERS</u> </span><span style="">in the main petition that can only be completely resolved after a </span>hearing
thereon." (<span class="GramE">underlining</span> ours) And the Petition was
set for hearing on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1986</st1:date>.”
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 4-A)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to petitioner, since the respondent court resolved no
new or other matter in its <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1986</st1:date>
order, the <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date>
order should be considered as already a final one insofar as the issues
resolved therein are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote
the petitioner, "this phrase ‘certain matters’ referred to by the
respondent court did not touch or dwell on ‘certain matters’ not yet passed
upon by it, but reversed itself on the same matters already resolved by it
earlier after the lapse <span style="">of the 15-day
period without any motion for reconsideration ever asked by herein private
respondent Go <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>." (Petition, p. 4)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, on the other hand, argues that the order of
May 27, 1986, was merely an interlocutory order that did not finally dispose of
the action and that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof
dealt only with the preliminary injunction incident; that the denial of the
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction and the setting of further
hearing on the main petition was the highlight of the said order and that since
the order was interlocutory in nature, nothing precluded respondent judge from
further hearing the case after the issuance of the May 27, 1986 order and
deciding it on its merits on July 8, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find the contention of the<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>petitioner meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
<span style="">v. </span>Republic, L-19533, <st1:date year="1963" day="13" month="10">Oct. 13, 1963</st1:date>, 9 SCRA 440, this
Court said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“The <span style="">test to ascertain whether an order is interlocutory or final is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>does it leave something to be done in the </span>court
with respect to the merits of the case?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it does, it is interlocutory:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>if it does not, it is <span style="">final.” In
the instant case, it is </span>evident <span style="">that
</span>the respondent court resolved no new or other matter in the order of <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, it necessarily follows
that the order of <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1986</st1:date>
should be deemed as a final order in so far as the <span style="">issues resolved therein are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An order which decides an issue or issues in a complaint is final and <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, although the other issue or issues have not
been resolved, if the latter issues are distinct </span>and <span style="">separate from the others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the respondent court was without
jurisdiction to modify or reverse </span>the <span style="">earlier order after the expiration of fifteen (15) days from and after
receipt thereof by the </span>parties, considering that there was no motion for
reconsideration filed by then private respondent Go <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Chu</span></span><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="">regards </span>the second issue, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>agree with
petitioner that Section 33 of B.P. 129 allows the plaintiff in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> action to apply for a writ of preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With the
advent of B.P.129, Art.</span> 539 of the New Civil Code, Sec. 88 of the
Judiciary Act of 1948, and Sec. 3, Rule 70 of <span style="">the </span><span style="">Rules of Court </span>have
<span style="">been substantially </span><span style="">modified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>B</span><span style="">.P.
129 provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"provided the </span><span style="">main action </span><span style="">is within its </span>jurisdiction, an
inferior court can appoint <span style="">a </span>receiver
and it has jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary injunction in either
forcible entry or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> cases." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>, Remedial Law Compendium,
Second Revised Edition, p. 33).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“Under the present law, an inferior court has jurisdiction to grant
provisional remedies in proper cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These proper cases would be:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-right: 0in;">1) <span style=""> </span>Preliminary
attachment under Rule 57, provided the principal action is within its
jurisdiction such as an action for recovery of personal property valued at not
more than P20,000.00; an action for recovery of a sum of money not exceeding
P20,000.00; an action of forcible entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-right: 0in;"><span class="GramE">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Preliminary injunction under Rule 58 in both
forcible entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> also in cases
mentioned in the preceding paragraph."</span> (Dean Jose Y. <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, Phil. Legal Studies, Series No. 1, the Judiciary
Reorganization Act of 1980, 1981 edition, pp. 43-44).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The third issue centers on the applicability of prior
conciliation proceedings pursuant to P.D. 1508, section 6 of which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Conciliation, pre-condition
to filing of complaint.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No
complaint, petition, action or proceeding involving any matter within the authority
of the <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> as <span style="">provided
in Sec. 2 hereof shall be filed or instituted in court or any other government
office for adjudication unless there has been a confrontation of the parties
before the <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> Chairman or the <span class="SpellE">Pangkat</span>
and no conciliation or settlement has been reached as certified by the <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> Secretary or the <span class="SpellE">Pangkat</span>
Secretary, attested by the <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> or <span class="SpellE">Pangkat</span> Chairman, or unless the settlement has been
repudiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the parties may go
directly to </span><span style="">court in the </span><span style="">following cases:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">where</span>
the accused is under detention;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">where</span>
a person has otherwise been deprived <span style="">of
</span>personal liberty calling for <span style="">habeas</span>
corpus proceedings;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) <span class="GramE">actions</span> coupled with provisional <span style="">remedies such </span>as preliminary
injunction, attachment, delivery of personal property and support <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">where</span>
the action may otherwise be barred by the Statute of Limitations.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing that prior conciliation
proceedings as mandated by P.D. 1508 <span style="">were
inapplicable to the </span>petitioner's suit <span style="">before the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Municipal</span></st1:placename><span style="">

provides that an action “coupled with provisional remedies <span style="">such as preliminary injunction,” etc. does
not </span><span style="">require conciliation
proceedings as </span>a pre-condition for filing an action in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case of petitioner being an exception <span style="">to </span>the requirement of prior
conciliation by P.D. 1508, it was not necessary for petitioner to first secure
the necessary certification to file action from the proper <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that petitioner's
complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> in the Municipal Trial Court
did not fall within the exceptions enumerated <span style="">in </span><span style="">Sec. </span>6 of P.D. 1508, the lower court in its decision ruled that
the April 1982 certification to file action issued by the proper <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> <span style="">was </span>sufficient
compliance with P.D. 1508.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth issue, private respondent is of the firm belief
that the action he filed be<span style="">fore</span>
the respondent Regional Trial Court was both an <span style="">original </span>action for <i>certiorari</i> and <span style="">a </span>petition for <i>certiorari</i> as<span style=""> a </span>mode of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Applying Sec. <span style="">22</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
</span>B.P. 129 (governing law in the matter of appeals from the inferior
courts <span style="">to </span>the Regional Trial
Courts), decisions <span style="">of </span>inferior courts
may be elevated to the Regional Trial Court <span style="">only </span>by ordinary appeal, that is, by filing a Notice of Appeal
with the <span style="">inferior court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The said proviso does not admit <span style="">of </span><span style="">any </span>other mode of elevating decisions
of inferior courts to the Regional Trial Court presumably to <span style="">carry o</span>ut the purpose of B.P. 129 which
is <span style="">to simplify </span>judicial procedure
to effect a speedy administration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the fifth issue, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that
respondent court has no jurisdiction in a <i>certiorari</i> c<span style="">ase to </span>entertain procedural questions
or questions of facts or substance already passed upon by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>

</span>of fact which cannot be raised or corrected in a <i>certiorari</i> case,
but should be assigned as error and reviewed in the appeal properly taken from
the decision rendered by the trial court on the merits of the <span style="">case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(<span class="SpellE">Lamagan</span> v. de la Cruz, 40 SCRA 101).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered that <span style="">except </span>for the lower court's admission
in evidence of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Certification of 1982 and
the said court's appreciation of <span style="">the </span>said
Certification <span style="">as
</span>sufficient compliance with P.D. 1508, the respondent court's order
(RTC), which is herein sought <span style="">to be </span>nullified,
resolved all the matters raised by private respondent in his petition, against
the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admissibility of evidence is
a matter that <span style="">is </span>addressed to the
sound discretion of the trial court (the lower court in this case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, no potent reason existed
<span style="">to </span>justify respondent court’s
substitution of the lower court's judgment with its <span style="">own </span>judgment.</p>

<blockquote>"Errors in the appreciation of evidence <span style="">may not </span><span style="">be reviewed by <i>certiorari</i> because they do not involve any </span><span style="">jurisdictional </span><span style="">question." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Mujer</span> v.

<p class="BODY">Further, in an original <span style="">action

on grounds other than those specified under Sec. 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of

<p class="BODY">In an original action for c<i>ertiorari</i> <span style="">under Sec. 1, </span>Rule <span style="">65 </span>of the Rules of Court, the <span style="">grounds for </span>the issuance of the Writ
of <i>Certiorari</i> are as follows, to <span style="">wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">(a) Lack of jurisdiction;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">(b) Grave abuse of discretion; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin: 0.1in 0.6in 0.1in 0.8in;">(c) When the court acts without or <span style="">in </span>excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>have consistently adhered to the principle that only errors <span style="">of </span>jurisdiction <span style="">are correctible </span><span style="">by <i>certiorari.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">As
</span>early as in the <span style="">case </span>of
Herrera vs. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>, 25 Phil 245, 271, the <span style="">Supreme </span><span class="GramE">court</span>
ruled:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“<span style="">The </span>office of the Writ of <i>Certiorari</i> ha<span style="">s been</span> reduced to the correction <span style="">of defects of jurisdiction solely and </span>cannot
legally <span style="">be u</span>sed for any other <span style="">purpose.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the only grounds which may serve as the basis for the
respondent court to raise the writ of <i>certiorari</i> are lack of
jurisdiction or g<span style="">rave </span>abuse of
discretion by the inferior court or that the said inferior court acted without <span style="">or in </span>excess of jurisdiction in its
appreciation of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> certification as
constituting sufficient compliance with P.D. 1508.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit <span style="">filed </span>by petitioner against private
respondent, the lower court undoubtedly acquired jurisdiction over the subject
matter and over the person of then defendant (now private respondent) by the
filing of the complaint and service of summons upon then defendant (now private
respondent) and the filing by the latter of his answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it cannot be said that the lower court
had no jurisdiction to render the decision set aside by respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the lower court committed a
mistake on the merits of the case, it was <span style="">in
</span>the exercise of such jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The error, if <span style="">at all, </span>is
at most one of judgment and not of jurisdiction, which cannot be the object of
a petition for <i>certiorari.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
proper remedy in such case was appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Errors in the application of the law and the appreciation of evidence
committed by a court <span style="">after </span>it
has acquired jurisdiction over a case, are correctible only by appeal (So <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> vs<span style="">. </span><span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, 29 Phil. 208; Valencia
vs. <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>, 50 O.G. 5815, Dec. 1954 (CA) citing
Herrera <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>,
et al., 26 Phil. 245).</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be said that the lower court committed a grave
abuse of <span style="">discretion or exceeded its </span>jurisdiction
when it appreciated the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> certification <span style="">as </span>sufficient compliance with P.D.
1508.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
filed by private respondent before the respondent court, he did not allege that
the lower court’s decision was outside or in excess of its jurisdiction, or was
issued in grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent merely alleged that the lower <span style="">court </span>"erroneously":<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>appreciated facts and evidence, issued interlocutory orders, and
appreciated the issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
challenged the soundness of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These do not constitute excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that
there is <span style="">"excess </span>of
jurisdiction" where the court has jurisdiction but has transcended the <span style="">same or </span>acted without any statutory
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
vs. <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, 55 Phil. 924).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is "grave abuse of
discretion" when <span style="">there is </span>a
capricious and whimsical exercise of <span style="">judgment
</span>amounting to lack of jurisdiction <span style="">or
</span>where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by <span style="">reasons </span>of passion or personal
hostility, and it is so patent and gross as to amount to an invasion of
positive duty or <span style="">to a </span>virtual
refusal to perform <span style="">the duty enjoined or
</span>to <span style="">act at all </span>in
contemplation of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Tavera</span>-Luna, Inc.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, 67 Phil. 341).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We
</span>find <span style="">no such grave abuse of
discretion committed by the lower court </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">appreciating the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> certification to be sufficient compliance with P.
D. 1508.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the respondent court
categorically ruled that there was no grave abuse of discretion or excess of
jurisdiction on the part of the lower court when it held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of each particular questioned act of the respondent judge would plainly show
