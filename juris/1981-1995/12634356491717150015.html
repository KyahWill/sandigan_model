<p class="BODY">In the meantime, evidence for respondent Judge consisting of
testimony from persons mentioned in the present complaint, was presented before

<p class="BODY">As a rule, the Court does not, as a matter of course, dismiss
administrative complaints (especially those charging offenses as serious as
those here charged) against members of the Bench on account of withdrawal of
the charges or desistance of the complainant from prosecuting the complaint.
The Court, however, in the complaint at bar, has very little choice save to
adopt the recommendation of the Investigating Justice to dismiss A.M. No.

321, i.e. (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) Motion to Submit their Formal Offer of
Evidence; (ii) Notice of Appeal; and (iii) Motions for Reconsideration, were
denied because they were either filed out of time or lacked any merit.
Respondent Judge explained that he had denied complainant's Formal Offer of
Evidence because it was filed beyond the period granted by the court <u>a quo</u>;
the Notice of Appeal was likewise denied because the decision had in the
meantime attained finality; that the first Motion for Reconsideration was
denied for lack of merit, and the second was rejected pursuant to the
prohibition against second motions for reconsideration in B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129. Respondent Judge called the Court's attention to
the fact that in CA-G.R. SP No. 16299, his decision in Civil Case No. 321 was
affirmed <u>en <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="2Q">As regards the petitioners [complainant and privies], they never
invoked the proceedings in Civil Case No. 163 as a defense in Civil Case No.
321 against the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> despite the judgment in
their (petitioners) favor as early as October 2, 1972. On the contrary, it was
the other way around. Civil Case No. 321 was pleaded by the petitioners in
abatement of Civil Case No. 163. When judgment was rendered in favor of the
petitioners in Civil Case No. 163 on October 2, 1972, they did not amend their
answer to the complaint in intervention in Civil Case No. 321, which was then
pending to invoke the judgment in their favor in Civil Case No. 163, but
instead went on full steam ahead in Civil Case No. 321. <u>Significantly, the
Formal Offer of Exhibits</u> by petitioners in Civil Case No. 321 <u>does not
include the judgment in Civil Case No. 163 or even made any reference thereto</u>.
Pronouncement of a <u>judgment in a former case</u> would <u>not</u>
necessarily <u>preclude <span class="SpellE">relitigation</span></u> of the
issues in a second case <u>if <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
is not invoked, since <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>
is a matter of defense and does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to
act on a second suit between the parties on the same subject matter</u> (<span class="SpellE">Kidpalos</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining
Company, 104 SCRA 913, 917) <u>Defenses and objections not raised in an answer
or a motion to dismiss [are] deemed waived</u> (Section 2, Rule 9, Rules of
Court) This is what happened in the present case.</p>

<p class="2Q">When the petitioners as defendants submitted the merits of their
claim to the land in question in Civil Case No. 321 and evidence in support
thereof was adduced, they may be deemed to have waived the benefits of the
judgment in Civil Case No. 163 and agreed instead to <span class="SpellE">relitigate</span>
in Civil Case No. 321 the merits of their claim to the land in question. It was
<u>only after an adverse decision was rendered against them in Civil Case No.
321 and after the judgment had became final, that petitioners invoked for the
first time the judgment in Civil Case No. 163. The rule is settled that if the
doctrine of <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> is
not set up as a defense or ground of objection seasonably, it is deemed waived
and cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal</u> (Alvarez, Jr. vs. Court
of Appeals, 158 SCRA 401).</p>

<p class="2Q">3) Re: Orders Relating to the Execution of the Judgment in Civil
Case No. 321.</p>

the police and that the doctor testified that the victim was bigger than the
accused. As to the first allegation, respondent's stand is tenable that he did
not state that Atty. Amador testified in court. As regard the second, nowhere
does it appear on record that the doctor testified to that effect. Prudence
dictates that respondent should have ascertained the veracity of his factual
findings in his decision, especially in the questioned criminal case involving
as it does a judgment of acquittal in a murder case.</blockquote>

acquitted the accused for the alleged failure of the prosecution to prove his
guilt beyond reasonable doubt <u>despite his plea of guilt, corroborated by the

facts of the case do not establish such a justifying circumstance. <u>The two
(2) essential requisites thereof</u>, namely <u>unlawful aggression and
reasonableness of the means employed to repel it are not present</u>. When an
accused claims self-defense, the burden of proof is shifted to him. He must
rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the
prosecution, for even if the latter's evidence is weak, it could not be
disbelieved after the accused himself admitted the killing (PP v. <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, 172 SCRA 149). Besides, <u>even if it was established

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">After examination of the decision
rendered by respondent Judge and the record of Criminal Case No. 6184, this
Court, like Deputy Court Administrator <span class="SpellE">Bernad</span> and the
Investigating Justice, is convinced that the prosecution's evidence against the
accused Adonis Francisco constituted proof beyond reasonable doubt, that the
acquittal of the accused by respondent Judge was rendered in gross ignorance of
the law and tainted with grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">A claim of self-defense is, in principle, an admission that he
had inflicted a fatal blow on the person of the victim, but that the injuries
so inflicted were justified under the circumstances. It is incumbent,
therefore, upon the accused to prove by clear and convincing evidence the
unlawful <span class="SpellE">unaggression</span> on the part of the victim; the
reasonableness of the necessary means he employed to prevent or repel the
initial aggression of the victim; and the absence of sufficient provocation on
the part of the accused that could have precipitated the aggression by the
victim. Even if the evidence of prosecution be "weak," the accused
cannot escape criminal liability on that ground alone since he has the burden
of justifying by clear and convincing evidence what would otherwise be a
felonious act on his part.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough review of the facts obtaining in Criminal Case
No. 6184, the Court is unable to see how respondent Judge could have reasonably
ruled that the accused Adonis Francisco, in killing the victim, acted in
self-defense. The bare allegation of the accused that it was the victim, and
not himself, who had provided provocation, was obviously self-serving. The only
corroboration of that allegation was provided by the wife of the accused who
could not be expected to be an unbiased witness and whose evidence was clearly
hearsay in character since <u>she did not see the incident herself but merely
testified on what the accused had told her after the killing</u>. Moreover, the
testimony of the wife was offered merely to prove voluntary surrender on the
part of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even if the respondent Judge had found that the victim <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span> had "boxed" the accused Adonis Francisco,
the response of the accused against the victim was obviously excessive and
unnecessary, <u>considering that the victim fled from the accused</u> who
nonetheless chased him and inflicted three (3) stab wounds on the victim, the
last one penetrating the back and the spine of the victim two (2) inches deep.
The Forensic Examiner Dr. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Capelan</span>
testified that he had difficulty extracting the knife from the body of the victim
because it had been embedded through the vertebral column deep enough to have
penetrated the back lateral and lower portion of the heart of the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused must have delivered the stabbing blow with great force. There is
here an obvious and total misapplication of the law on self-defense. The rule
on self-defense is an elementary norm of law of which respondent Judge seemed
totally unaware.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the acts of respondent Judge in this case, the Investigating
Justice recommended that he be suspended from office without pay for one (1)
month.</p>

of Discretion and Gross Ignorance of the Law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his verified complaint, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricarte</span> stated that he was the father of Edgar <span class="SpellE">Ricarte</span>, the murder victim in Criminal Case No. 5739
entitled "People of the Philippines v. Sonny <span class="SpellE">Baruelo</span>;"
that the accused Sonny <span class="SpellE">Baruelo</span> was acquitted by
respondent Judge for alleged failure of the prosecution to prove guilt beyond
reasonable doubt; that in rendering that acquittal, respondent Judge was
partial to the accused, considering that the defense had failed to discredit <span class="SpellE">Bernito</span> Alvarez, the prosecution eye-witness; that
respondent Judge had discredited the prosecution eye-witness Alvarez by making
assumptions in favor of the accused for which no factual basis had been
established during the trial; that respondent Judge relied solely on his
personal notes in deciding the case, disregarding completely the transcript of
stenographic notes taken; that if respondent Judge had referred to the
transcript, he would have found out that the defense witnesses had contradicted
each other in their testimony in material respects; that the testimony of
defense witness Ben <span class="SpellE">Betonio</span> contradicted that of the
accused and his wife, but partly confirmed the testimony of prosecution
eye-witness Alvarez that the victim had been killed outside of the house after
having been overtaken by accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court required respondent Judge to file a Comment and there
he stated that Criminal Case No. 5739 was a simple case where the accused had
proved self-defense; that the victim who lived for sixteen (16) days after he
was stabbed did not execute any affidavit; that the fact that defense counsel
was his former Clerk of Court was not a sufficient reason for respondent Judge
to inhibit himself from deciding the case.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Investigating Justice examined in detail the decision
rendered by respondent Judge in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Baruelo</u></span>

Investigating Justice reached certain conclusions which may be summarized in
the following terms:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:41.85pt;text-indent:-20.25pt">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>There are statements in the assailed decision
of respondent Judge that "are not in accordance with the evidence adduced during

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:41.85pt;text-indent:-20.25pt">(2) There were
inconsistencies on "very substantial matters" between the testimony
of defense witness <span class="SpellE">Betonio</span> on direct examination and
his testimony on cross-examination; consequently, the credibility of his
testimony was "questionable;"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the testimony of that defense witness had at least partially
corroborated the testimony of prosecution eye-witness Alvarez that he saw the
accused come from inside the house and stab the victim Edgar <span class="SpellE">Ricarte</span> who was walking in front of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
house.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:41.85pt;text-indent:-20.25pt">(3) The claim of
the accused of self-defense had not been convincingly proved:</p>

<p class="2Q">"<u>The number of stab wounds, 5 at that, inflicted on the
victim by the accused</u> [Sonny <span class="SpellE">Baruelo</span>] as well as <u>the
location of the same shows that it was more than mere repelling the alleged
attack on the person of the accused Sonny <span class="SpellE">Baruelo</span>
that caused him to stab the victim 5 times</u>. Also, there was no physical
proof of the alleged blows by Edgar <span class="SpellE">Ricarte</span> on the
face, forearm and stomach of the accused;"</p>

<p class="2Q">"The <u>knife which the victim allegedly tried to stab the
accused, with, was not produced</u> before the court. It may be said that
except for the <u>self-serving testimony of the accused himself</u> which was <u>corroborated

self-defense."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The basic conclusion reached by the Investigating Justice was
that:</p>

<blockquote>"While malice does not appear to have attended the
inaccuracies found in the questioned decision, there certainly was <span class="SpellE"><u>misappreciation</u></span><u> of the evidence</u> and <u>non-application
of the settled rules on the matter by the respondent judge</u>. There is no
dispute that the <u>respondent judge failed to draw up his decision with care
and failed to make certain that the contents of his decision truly and
accurately reflect what is on record</u>. Thus, the respondent judge may be
said to be grossly negligent which amounts to ignorance of the law in the
rendition of the questioned decision."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Investigating Justice found respondent Judge
guilty of gross negligence "which amounts to ignorance of the law,"
for which she recommended the penalty of suspension without pay for one (1)
month.</p>

<p class="BODY">After careful examination of the decision of respondent Judge in
Criminal Case No. 5739 as well as the underlying records of that case, the
Court agrees with the findings of fact of the Investigating Justice. There is
in this case the same gross ignorance on the part of respondent Judge of the
very basic substantive rules of self-defense that were obvious in A.M. No.
RTJ-91-746 (<span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Genova</span>)
which law students learn in their first year in law school. There is also
failure on the part of respondent Judge to take account of the facts as shown
by the evidence made of record during the trial, such that some of the
conclusions reached by the respondent Judge found no basis in the evidence of
record.</p>

<span class="SpellE">Estorum</span> shot the victim on the right abdomen; that

only <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
were arrested and later arraigned on 8 October 1990 and 14 August 1991,
respectively; that co-accused Joel <span class="SpellE">Estorum</span> was never
arrested and has remained since then a fugitive from the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The story presented by the defense in Criminal Case No. 442 was
the following: that in the mid-afternoon of 24 August 1989, the victim was at
the store of <span class="SpellE">Sitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Estorum</span>
where accused <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>' wife <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
was selling "tuba"; that the victim <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Perino</span>, appearing to be drunk, wanted to purchase
some "tuba" on credit; that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> refused
to sell any to him on credit until the victim <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>
shall have paid his previous debt of P80.00; that the victim <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> then pulled the hair of <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>;
that <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>, coming from behind the store,
confronted the victim and demanded that he release his wife; that <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> then pulled out a gun and pointed it at <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>; that accused <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>
then tried to wrest the gun from the victim; that co-accused <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>, seeing the commotion between his brother <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> and the victim, and attempting to help his
brother <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>, pulled out a <u>bolo</u> which the
victim had on a scabbard on his side and thereupon stabbed the victim with the <u>bolo</u>;
that almost simultaneously, while <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> and the
victim <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> were wrestling for the possession of
the latter's gun, the gun went off the bullet hitting <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span>;
that both <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
subsequently escaped from the scene of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, respondent Judge found <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span>
guilty of homicide with the mitigating circumstance of incomplete defense of
his brother (co-accused) <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span>. <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> was acquitted upon the ground of defense of
relative (his wife) and the ground that gunshot wound was inflicted
accidentally. Accused Joel <span class="SpellE">Estorum</span>, although never
arraigned before the trial court, was acquitted because of lack of evidence
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Report, the Investigating Justice made the following
observations:</p>

<blockquote>"In the criminal case a quo, evidence is clear that <u>the
victim suffered two stab wounds</u>. Logic dictates that since <u>accused <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> testified that he stabbed the victim only once</u>

p. 9; p. 12, <st1:date year="1991" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1991</st1:date>)
<u>someone else must have inflicted the second stab wound</u>. There is

suffered two stab wounds and 1 gunshot wound (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,

vouchers of AVECO Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the vouchers showing the total amount of P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the complainant testified before the Investigating
Justice that she was given those vouchers by Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>,
an accountant of Aida Valencia who had asked Evelyn to prepare the vouchers for
respondent Judge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>, after initial
failure to attend the hearings, did appear before the Investigating Justice and
stated that her failure to attend the earlier hearings was due to "the <span class="GramE">respondent Judge threaten[</span><span class="SpellE">ing</span>] to
file a case against her before the Professional Regulatory Commission."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony of Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> was summarized by the
Investigating Justice in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"[Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>] testified that
since July 29, 1992, in the residence of Aida Valencia, in <span class="SpellE">Palmera</span>
Heights <span class="SpellE">Subd</span>., the <u>respondent judge had threatened
to file such administrative charge against her if she appears before the
Investigator</u>: that during the proceedings of this administrative case, the
respondent judge told her to hide in the house of Aida Valencia in order that
the process server could not serve on her the subpoena for the said hearings;
that Aida Valencia told her that if ever she would testify, it would only cost
Aida Valencia P100,000.00 - P50,000.00 for the judge and P50,000.00 for the
police; <u>that she (Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>) got the original
copies of the said vouchers from the files of <span class="SpellE">Aveco</span>
Export Co., had them photocopied and returned the original copies</u>; that
when she saw the said vouchers and asked <u>Aida Valencia about them, the
latter said that she used them '<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">paggapang</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kaso</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">lupa</span></u>';
that the signatures in the said <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> vouchers are
the genuine signatures of Aida Valencia for Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>
is familiar with the same as Aida Valencia always sign in her presence; that
sometimes, Evelyn prepared the checks for the professional fees and Aida
Valencia signed them; that Aida Valencia gave her mother, Flora <span class="SpellE">Guadayo</span>, a Rolex wrist watch for the latter to appear in
this administrative case in favor of the respondent judge and she (Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>) was given a Rolex wrist watch in order not to
appear as the complainant's witness in the present administrative case; that
her mother failed to attend the September 21, 1992 hearing because she went to <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> for the hearing of a land entitled 'Valenzuela, et
al v. <span class="SpellE">Guadayo</span>' before the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>
of Judge <span class="SpellE">Genova</span>; that she appeared in this
administrative case because she was already sick and tired of the grave threats
against her by Aida Valencia and for public interest; that Aida Valencia made
her sign a prepared affidavit in September 1992 right after the publication in
the '<span class="SpellE">Panahon</span>' of the bribery case involving the
respondent judge; that <u>when she stayed in the house of Aida Valencia with
the respondent judge and his wife, he would ask money from Aida Valencia for
transportation and other ordinary expenses, and the latter would put in his
pocket, a P1,000.00 denomination bill</u>: and that she filed administrative
cases for bribery against the judge and the Justices who rendered the decisions
against her in the civil cases she filed before their respective courts (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 3-38, October 7, 1992, 1:30 p.m.)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge contended that the testimony of Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> should not be believed considering that she was
mentally ill, being a schizophrenic and being in and out of the mental hospital
several times. In support of this assertion, Dr. Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Alvaran</span>
of the National Center for Mental Health was presented and testified that
Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> had been confined a number of times in
that hospital with the diagnosis of "schizophrenia paranoid-type" and
"schizophrenia undifferentiated-type." The Investigating Justice,
however, noted that a court report dated <st1:date year="1992" day="20" month="10">20 October 1992</st1:date> by the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> for Mental Health prepared
by <span class="SpellE">Carmelito</span> <span class="SpellE">Erespe</span> and
approved by Dr. Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Alvaran</span> contained the
following recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>"At present she (Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>) is
deemed to be free of psychotic symptoms and is deemed fit to stand witness in
court."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Aida Valencia appeared as a defense witness at the investigation
and there said that she never gave any money to respondent Judge nor prepared
any vouchers for him; that the signatures on the <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copies of the vouchers were not her signatures; that she would not pay
respondent Judge legal fees because she had a lawyer, one Atty. <span class="SpellE">Apaya</span>; that she had indeed employed Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> as auditor of the company (AVECO) from 1990-1991
until Evelyn became a "mental case."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the portion of her Second Report dealing with this complaint,
the Investigating Justice stated that she was not convinced "that bribery
took place between Aida Valencia as the giver and the respondent judge as the
receiver."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
The Investigating Justice submitted two (2) reasons for this conclusion:
firstly, the Investigating Justice believes that Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>
had a "fixation" that "every court victory has been attended by
a bribe received by a judge from the winning litigant;"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
and secondly, the Investigating Justice felt that the <span class="SpellE">xerox</span>
copies of the vouchers did not constitute sufficient evidence of a bribe. She
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of the two
vouchers in question likewise are not sufficiently convincing of the bribe
alleged in this administrative case. In the first place, they are mere <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies and as such could easily be subject to
insertions, additions or changes of matters not found in the original.
Secondly, the data contained therein do not support the dishonest act involved.
In Exhibit F, while there is the phrase 'payment for judge' the name of the
judge is not indicated. It does not necessarily follow that because Aida Valencia
is an heir of one of the plaintiffs in a case before the respondent <span class="GramE">judge,</span> such payment was made to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In Exhibit G, the data contained therein regarding explanation of
transactions and <span class="GramE">account are</span> contradictory. While at
the top, there are the words 'Judge Manuel <span class="SpellE">Genova</span>',
in the box for 'Explanation of Transaction' is written 'payment for legal fees
for the case' and in the box for account is written 'Professional fee."
Certainly, if the explanation of the transaction is payment for legal fees,
then such payment is legitimate.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While apparently dismissing the complaint of <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span>
Q. Valencia for lack of sufficient evidence, the Investigating Justice took
respondent Judge to task for certain improprieties:</p>

<blockquote>"An observation of the Investigator is that the <u>respondent
judge has utilized Flora <span class="SpellE">Guadayo</span>, a litigant in a
civil case before his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, as his witness in this
administrative case</u>, and that despite the fact that she has already
testified for him, <u>he has not inhibited himself from presiding over her case
as of the date of the last hearing of this administrative case</u> on November
11, 1992.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Investigator is of the view that under the circumstances, the
respondent judge has displayed lack of sound discretion for he has placed
himself in a situation where the so-called cold neutrality of a judge can no
longer be said of him for the litigant, Flora <span class="SpellE">Guadayo</span>,
has done him a favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Also, on one occasion when the respondent judge went to the office
of the stenographers in these administrative cases in order to have a copy of
the transcript, it was Aida Valencia who paid for the transcript, although
according to him, he paid her after. Such payment by Aida Valencia (although
paid later by the respondent judge) is an act of impropriety considering that
she won a case in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>. If may be mentioned that
a copy of the transcript could be send to him even if there was no prior
payment as was done with the transcript of the proceedings on October 7, 1992</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, the respondent judge, as shown in the earlier part of
the proceedings, was trying to make it appear to the Investigator that Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> could not be a witness in this administrative case
as she was allegedly so mentally sick and confined at the mental hospital (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 65, Aug. 18, 1992, a.m.) when in fact, on the day
that she was supposed to appear, he knew that she would not appear as
instructed by Aida Valencia."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having carefully reviewed the record, the Court finds that the
evidence submitted against respondent Judge on this bribery charge is not
insubstantial. The testimony of Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> cannot
be disregarded as the meaningless babble of a mad woman, considering the
certification issued by the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for Mental Health, and considering the clear and coherent manner in which she
testified. Aida Valencia contradicted the testimony of Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>; that was, of course, to be expected. Considering
all the testimony and other evidence submitted in this case, the balance of
evidence appears to the Court to be just about at equipoise. The vouchers
submitted by the complainant were photocopies only. The record does not show
that efforts were made by complainant to secure production of the original
vouchers by <u>subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span></u>.
Photocopies could be faithful reproductions of the originals. Respondent Judge
sought to suggest that the amounts indicated in the photocopies of the vouchers
may have been amounts paid to the commissioners appointed in the partition
case. This effort was not convincing. At the same time, however, the
photocopied vouchers do not unequivocally <span class="GramE">state that the sums
there set out were</span> given to respondent Judge. Upon the other hand, if
those sums had indeed been given to and received by respondent Judge, he would
not, in realistic expectation, have given a receipt for them; to require
submission of such a receipt in order to hold respondent guilty would be unreal
and unreasonable. Finally, we note that if, in fact, one of the vouchers
(Exhibit "G") was "payment for legal fees," such payment
would not have been legitimate if made to respondent Judge; for he, an
incumbent judge, obviously could not have legally practiced law and charged
legal fees for legal services.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that, on balance, and not without hesitation, the
evidence submitted against respondent Judge in this seventh administrative case
is not sufficient basis for finding him guilty of bribery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking now a global view of all the seven (7) cases against
respondent Judge, and considering more particularly the conclusions we reached
in respect of the fourth, fifth and sixth cases (A.M. No. <span class="GramE">RTJ-91-746;
A.M. No.</span> <span class="GramE">RTJ-91-767; and A.M. No.</span> RTJ-91-816)
above, in conjunction with our conclusion in the third case (A.M.
No.'RTJ-91-721), the Court concludes that respondent Judge has been shown to be
unfit to remain in the Judiciary and must accordingly, in the interest of the
service, be removed from the service. In the fourth, fifth and sixth cases
above, respondent Judge exhibited ignorance about basic principles of criminal
law so gross and appalling as to compel the conclusions that he could not have
been acting in good faith; that he is grossly incompetent as a judge; and that
to allow him to remain a judge is to impose an intolerable risk of letting
loose on our hapless society more persons who have committed crimes as serious
as murder and who should be behind prison bars. In the third case, respondent
Judge demonstrated that he is capable and willing to devote government property
to private and family purposes, a demonstration which reinforces the Court's
conviction concerning respondent Judge's unfitness to remain in the Judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the Court
Resolved to DISMISS the respondent Judge for gross ignorance of the law
amounting to gross incompetence and misconduct in office, and in the best
interest of the service, with forfeiture of all retirement privileges and
benefits he might otherwise be entitled to, <u>except</u> accrued earned leave
privileges or the money value thereof. This Resolution is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and respondent Judge shall vacate his position
forthwith.</p>
