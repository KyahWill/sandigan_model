				<BR><BR><p align="justify">Assailed in this petition for <em>certiorari</em> with prayer 
for a writ of preliminary injunction is the decision dated December 27, 1985 of 
the National Labor Relations Commission [NLRC] in NCR-9-3217-84 entitled, 
"<em>AHS/Philippines, Inc., Complainant-Appellee, versus AHS/Philippines 
Employees Union [FFW], B.A. Aganon, D.T. Guilles, E.G. Sulit and E.C. Rodriguez, 
Respondents-Appellants</em>," which affirmed the labor arbiter's decision 
declaring the strike held by petitioners as illegal, but with the modification 
that individual petitioners be reinstated to their former positions, or paid 
separation pay or the economic package offered by the company, if reinstatement 
is impossible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioner 
AHS/Philippines Employees Union [FFW] was the recognized collective bargaining 
agent of the rank-and-file employees of private respondent AHS/Philippines Inc., 
a company engaged in the sale of hospital and laboratory equipment and Berna and 
Pharmaton products.&nbsp; A collective bargaining agreement [CBA] was concluded 
between the parties for the period commencing December 1, 1981 to November 30, 
1984.<br><br>On July 26, 1984, petitioner union filed a notice of strike with 
the Bureau of Labor Relations, listing as ground therefor unfair labor practice 
consisting in:&nbsp; 1] diminution of benefits, 2] union busting, 3] illegal 
termination and 4] harassment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> A 
second notice of strike was thereafter filed on August 3, 1984 on substantially 
the same grounds and the additional charges of refusal to bargain, violation of 
the CBA and dismissal of union officers and members.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>On August 15, 1984, petitioner 
union struck.&nbsp; A picket was staged at private respondent company's premises at 
Pasong Tamo in Makati.<br><br>When the conciliation meetings conducted by the 
Bureau of Labor Relations proved unavailing, private respondent company filed a 
petition to declare the strike illegal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> After issues had been joined with 
petitioner union's submission of its position paper, hearings ensued before 
Labor Arbiter Virginia Son.<br><br>On March 26, 1985, Labor Arbiter Son rendered 
a decision declaring the strike staged by petitioner union illegal and ordering 
the lifting of the picket established in the premises of private respondent 
company.&nbsp; All the officers of the union who joined and were responsible for the 
declaration of said strike were deemed to have lost their employment status, 
while the other non-officer employees who sympathized and joined the strike were 
ordered reinstated to their former or equivalent positions without strike 
duration pay, or paid separation pay or the economic package offered by the 
company, whichever is higher, in case reinstatement was not possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Dissatisfied, petitioners appealed 
the labor arbiter's ruling to the NLRC <em>en banc</em>, which rendered the 
assailed decision.&nbsp; Hence, this petition.<br><br>On July 30, 1986, after public 
and private respondents had submitted their respective comments to the petition, 
the Court resolved to dismiss the petition for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> A motion for reconsideration filed by 
union president Lorenzo Leones and vice-president Ernesto Ilagan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> was denied on September 8, 1986.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Upon receipt of the notice of said denial, 
petitioners forthwith filed a motion with leave of Court to allow petitioners to 
file last or final motion for reconsideration, on the ground, among others, that 
the first motion for reconsideration was filed by the aforesaid union officers 
without the assistance of counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The 
motion was opposed by private respondent company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Pending action on this motion, the 
Kilusang Mayo Uno [KMU] staged a picket in front of the P. Faura gate of this 
Court on October 27, 1986 in protest of the dismissal by the Court of the 
petition at bar.&nbsp; Reacting to the circular signed by Nick Elman of the KMU 
distributed to the public during the picket, respondent company filed a motion 
to cite petitioners, the KMU and Nick Elman in contempt of court.&nbsp; The alleged 
contemptors, upon being required, submitted their joint comment on the contempt 
charge,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> to which respondent company 
filed a reply.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, the 
case was heard on November 10, 1986,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
after which the Court resolved to require the parties to file their respective 
memoranda within 20 days.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The parties 
complied with this order.<br><br>In a manifestation dated December 2, 1986, 
counsel for private respondent company informed the Court that in January 1987, 
private respondent would close its operations in the Philippines because of the 
continuing losses being sustained by its Philippine operations and the 
uncertainty of business recovery in the immediate future.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Petitioners filed a counter-manifestation 
and motion for early resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Because petitioners submitted a 
supplemental memorandum, the Court required private respondent company to file 
its own supplemental memorandum in reply to petitioners' supplemental 
memorandum.&nbsp; After private respondent had done so, the Court resolved to set 
aside its resolutions of July 30 and September 8, 1986 and to give due course to 
the petition.<br><br>In concluding that the strike declared by petitioners was 
illegal for being based on trivial grounds, public respondent NLRC ruled on the 
issues alleged in the notice of strike in this wise:<br><br>1. On the dismissal 
of fourteen <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> rank and file employees 
by respondent company, which according to petitioner union triggered the first 
notice of strike, the NLRC, while conceding that these employees had rendered 
service to respondent company for more than six [1] months when they were 
dismissed and that they performed activities which were usually necessary or 
desirable in the usual business of respondent company, took note that their 
services were engaged under a contract entered into by respondent company with a 
placement agency and that petitioner union never demanded that they be converted 
into regular employees nor instituted any grievance or complaint in behalf of 
said employees until some of them wrote petitioner union for assistance after 
their dismissal.&nbsp; On the basis of these observations, respondent NLRC concluded 
that petitioner union had no personality to represent said employees as their 
category as regular employees eligible for membership in the union under the 
terms of the CBA has not yet been finally determined at grievance or by final 
judgment and the assistance sought by them did not vest petitioner union with 
the legal personality to represent them, much less use their dismissal as a 
ground to strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>2] With 
respect to the increase in the area sales quota of the union president and 
vice-president, the NLRC found the increase justified by the change in the sales 
organization in January 1984, whereby each field representative, instead of 
carrying both Berna and Pharmaton products, would concentrate only on either 
one.&nbsp; It further observed that it was only after six [6] months after the plan 
had been in operation and when the union president failed to meet his quota that 
said union president filed his grievance; that the grievance was being threshed 
out in accordance with the grievance procedure outlined in the CBA and that any 
delay in the resolution thereof was not entirely attributable to the company.&nbsp; 
Moreover, respondent NLRC found the setting of the area sales quota not to be 
ill-motivated nor related to the president's union activities.&nbsp; Hence, it 
concluded that the union president's grievance was not a valid ground for a 
strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>3] As regards the 
non-implementation of the yearly increase in <em>per diems</em> and allowances, 
public respondent concurred with the observation of the Labor Arbiter that there 
was no such provision in the CBA so that said issue could not be a proper ground 
for the notice of strike or the strike itself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>4] Likewise not considered by the 
NLRC as a valid ground for strike was the failure of respondent company to 
provide space for a union office as stipulated under Art. XV, Section 1 of the 
CBA.&nbsp; The NLRC attributed such failure to the complacency exhibited by 
petitioner union in not taking up the matter again with respondent company after 
petitioner union rejected the set of rules drawn up by respondent company with 
respect to the use of the office in accordance with the CBA provision that the 
use of such office would be subject to any rules and regulations to be agreed 
upon by both union and company.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>5] Anent the recall by respondent 
company of the cars assigned to the field representatives, the NLRC found no 
violation of the CBA nor any unfair labor practice to have been committed by 
respondent company by reason thereof.&nbsp; Referring to Art. XIV, Sec. 2 of the CBA 
which granted to the assignee of a car to be disposed of the first priority to 
purchase the car at fifty [50] percent of the appraised market value, the NLRC 
found no indication that the cars were to be disposed of and therefore the CBA 
provision invoked by petitioner union had not come into operation.&nbsp; This being 
the case, such recall could not be a ground for a strike.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>6] The dismissal of 31 employees 
of respondent company's Pharmaceutical Division, the additional ground cited in 
the second notice of strike, was found by the NLRC to have been dictated by the 
change in the marketing strategy of Berna and Pharmaton products and not for the 
purpose of union-busting.&nbsp; Respondent NLRC gave credence to respondent company's 
claim that as early as October 1983, its operations had been seriously affected 
by the suspension of trade and foreign credit facilities, which situation grew 
worse in early 1984 when its suppliers of Berna and Pharmaton products insisted 
on a cash L/C basis or full guarantee by the mother company.&nbsp; As respondent 
company could not comply with these requirements, it decided to strengthen its 
other division, the HML Division, which sold hospital and laboratory equipment 
bought from the parent company.&nbsp; It posted a job-opening notice for 7 to 10 
medical representatives and one field supervisor for the HML Division.&nbsp; Amelita 
Calderon, a member of petitioner union applied for the position of medical 
representative, but was rejected for lack of the necessary educational 
attainment and unwillingness to accept provincial assignments.<br><br>When the 
economic crisis continued until midyear of 1984, respondent company decided to 
change its marketing strategy for the Berna and Pharmaton products to ensure the 
whole company's viability.&nbsp; Instead of ethical selling through the field 
representatives, it was decided to shift to the over-the-counter [OTC] method 
and to appoint Zuellig Pharma as national distributor.&nbsp; As this move would 
result in the abolition of the Pharmaceutical Division, the union president was 
advised on July 26, 1984 of the impending dissolution of said division and was 
asked to suggest ways and means by which the termination could be effected in 
the smoothest manner possible and with least pain.&nbsp; When on August 1, 1984, the 
union president categorically stated to the company president that the union 
would oppose any termination at all costs, respondent company decided to proceed 
with the announcement of the termination by serving notice on the same day to 
the 31 employees of the Pharmaceutical Division, said termination to take effect 
immediately upon service thereof.&nbsp; In lieu of the 30-day notice required by law, 
the employees were paid one month's salary.&nbsp; Fifteen accepted their 
termination.<br><br>Petitioners seek reversal of the above-cited NLRC findings 
and conclusions on the following grounds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; THE ASSAILED DECISION WHOLLY DISREGARDED VIOLATIONS BY 
THE COMPANY OF ART. 284 OF THE LABOR CODE AS WELL AS THE STIPULATED PROCEDURES 
GOVERNING DISMISSALS IN THE PARTIES' COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT;<br><br>B.&nbsp; 
THE NLRC ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT AFFIRMED THAT THE 
DISMISSAL OF THE FOURTEEN </em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><em> 
EMPLOYEES ON JULY 26, 1984 WAS NOT A PROPER GROUND FOR A STRIKE DESPITE 
CONFERMENT BY LAW OF REGULAR STATUS TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT;<br><br>C.&nbsp; THE NLRC 
GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE QUADRUPLING OF THE UNION PRESIDENT'S AREA 
SALES QUOTA WAS NOT AN ACT OF DISCRIMINATION AND HENCE NOT A VALID GROUND FOR 
STRIKE; and,<br><br>D. THE COMMISSION ACTED CAPRICIOUSLY, UNREASONABLY AND 
WITHOUT LEGAL BASIS WHEN IT RULED THAT THE CLOSURE OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL 
DIVISION AND THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSFER OF ITS DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS TO ANOTHER 
COMPANY IS NOT AN UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.</em></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Grounds A and B cited by petitioners are interrelated and will 
be discussed jointly.<br><br>Concededly, retrenchment to prevent losses is 
considered a just cause for terminating employment<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and the decision whether to resort to 
such move or not is a management prerogative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Basic, however, in human relations is the 
precept that "every person must, in the exercise of his rights, and in the 
performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due and observe 
honesty and good faith."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> Thus, in the 
case of <em>Remerco Garments Manufacturing v. Minister of Labor and Employment, 
et al</em>.,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Basically, the right of an employer to dismiss an employee 
differs from and should not be confused with the manner in which such right is 
exercised.&nbsp; It must not be oppressive and abusive since it affects one's person 
and property."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify"></p>
<p align="justify">Due perhaps to the fact that private respondent company 
presented a legally tenable ground for dismissing the 31 employees of its 
Pharmaceutical Division, both the labor arbiter and respondent NLRC totally 
missed the point petitioners were trying to drive home, <em>i.e.</em> that the 
manner by which the retrenchment was effected by respondent company ran counter 
to both law and the collective bargaining agreement.<br><br>Art. 284 of the 
Labor Code of the Philippines, as amended by Sec. 15 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 130, 
provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Art. 284.&nbsp; Closure of establishment and reduction of 
personnel. — The employer may also terminate the employment of any employee due 
to the installation of labor-saving devices, redundancy, retrenchment to prevent 
losses, or the closing or cessation of operation of the establishment or 
undertaking unless the closing is for the purpose of circumventing the 
provisions of this title, by serving a written notice on the workers and the 
Ministry of Labor and Employment at least one [1] month before the intended date 
thereof.&nbsp; x x x In case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of 
closure or cessation of operations of establishment or undertaking not due to 
serious business losses or financial reverses, the separation pay shall be 
equivalent to one [1] month or at least one-half [½] month pay for every year of 
service, whichever is higher.&nbsp; A fraction of at least six [1] months shall be 
considered one [1]whole year</em>."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the case at bar, respondent company offered to pay the 31 
dismissed employees one month salary in lieu of the one <em>[1]</em> month 
written notice required by law.&nbsp; This practice was allowed under the Termination 
Pay Laws<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> whereby if the employee is 
dismissed on the basis of just cause, the employer is not required to serve 
advance written notice based on the number of years the employee has served the 
employer, nor is the employer required to grant termination pay.&nbsp; It is only 
where the dismissal is without just cause that the employer must serve timely 
notice on the employee, otherwise the employer is obliged to pay the required 
termination compensation, except where other applicable statutes provide a 
different remedy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> Otherwise stated, 
it was the employer's failure to serve notice upon the employee, not the cause 
for the dismissal, that rendered the employer answerable for terminal pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Thus, notice may effectively be 
substituted by payment of the termination pay.<br><br>Under the New Labor Code, 
however, even if the dismissal is based on a just cause under Art. 284, the 
one-month written notice to both the affected employee and the Minister of Labor 
is required, on top of the separation pay.&nbsp; Hence, unlike in the old termination 
pay laws, payment of a month's salary cannot be considered substantial 
compliance with the provisions of Art. 284 of the Labor Code.&nbsp; Since the 
dismissal of the 31 employees of the Pharmaceutical Division of respondent 
company was effected in violation of the above-cited provision, the same is 
illegal.<br><br>Needless to say, in the absence of a showing that the illegal 
dismissal was dictated by anti-union motives, the same does not constitute an 
unfair labor practice as would be a valid ground for a strike.&nbsp; The remedy is an 
action for reinstatement with backwages and damages.&nbsp; Nevertheless, We take this 
actuation of respondent company as evidence of the abusive and oppressive manner 
by which the retrenchment was effected.&nbsp; And while the lack of proper notice 
could not be a ground for a strike, this does not mean that the strike staged by 
petitioner union was illegal because it was likewise grounded on a violation by 
respondent company of the CBA, enumerated as an unfair labor practice under Art. 
249 [i] of the Labor Code.<br><br>Appearing on record is the testimony of 
Carlito V. Santos, Controller of respondent company that the "principal strategy 
to shift to one distributor came as early as July."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Inspite of this, petitioner union was 
never consulted on the matter as provided under Section 4, Article VIII of the 
CBA as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"<em>Section 4.&nbsp; Consultations on Lay-Offs and 
Terminations.</em><br><em><br>a]&nbsp; the COMPANY agrees that whenever it will 
lay-off or terminate any covered employee for economic or other reasons, the 
UNION shall be consulted prior to such lay off/termination</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Verily, union president Lorenzo Leones was told by respondent 
company's president and managing director, Constancio V. Halili, Jr. on July 25, 
1984 about the impending closure, but contrary to the NLRC's assessment, said 
notice cannot be taken as a substantial compliance with the above-cited CBA 
provision.&nbsp; The July 25, 1984 meeting was called by Halili for the purpose of 
discussing Leones' grievance over the latter's increase in area sales quota.&nbsp; 
The information about the closure was a mere "by the way" or an "incidentally", 
a lip service, which does not constitute compliance in good faith of the CBA 
provision on consultation.<br><br>It appears that paying lip service to the CBA 
is a practice resorted to by respondent company.&nbsp; Thus, it posted for two days a 
job-opening notice for 7-10 field representatives and one supervisor in the HML 
Division as required by the CBA, but without disclosing that the Pharmaceutical 
Division was about to be dissolved.&nbsp; Feeling secure in their positions, the 
field representatives in the Pharmaceutical Division would naturally be 
uninterested in applying for the same position in the other division.&nbsp; 
Furthermore, respondent company listed educational requirements calculated to 
disqualify would-be applicants from the Pharmaceutical Division who were mostly 
commerce graduates, but eventually hired applicants who did not possess the 
required educational attainment.<br><br>Another evidence that respondent company 
intended to terminate the 31 employees of the Pharmaceutical Division without 
prior consultation with petitioner union is the recall of the cars assigned to 
the field representatives.&nbsp; Two memoranda dated July 23 and 24 addressed to the 
HML Division and the Pharmaceutical Division, respectively, were sent out, 
directing the field representatives to turn-over their respective cars for 
inspection at the nearby Cressida Motors.&nbsp; The memorandum to the HML Division 
indicated July 26, 1984 as the date of release of the cars to the field 
representatives, while that to the Pharmaceutical Division merely mentioned 
"cut-off dates this July."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> The reason 
given by respondent company for the recall was that estimates of car maintenance 
and repair costs were to be reported by Carlito Santos to its Regional Office in 
Australia.&nbsp; This is obviously an afterthought because the testimony of said 
Carlito Santos was that he left for Sydney, Australia on July 24, 1984 and 
stayed there only for three <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> days or 
until July 27, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> While the recall 
of the cars per se did not constitute a violation of Section 2, Article XIV of 
the CBA on the car purchase option, We consider the same as an indicia of the 
blatant disregard by private respondent company of the CBA provision on 
consultation.<br><br>In the same manner that We found the dismissal of the 31 
employees of the Pharmaceutical Division in itself not to be constitutive of an 
unfair labor practice, so must the dismissal of the 14 rank-and-file employees 
be characterized.&nbsp; In the first instance it is not disputed that these employees 
were hired by respondent company thru a placement agency.&nbsp; In the absence of any 
evidence that the placement agency did not have substantial capital or 
investment in the form of tools, equipment machineries, work premises, among 
others, We cannot conclude that the arrangement between respondent company and 
said placement agency was "Labor-only" contracting as to make respondent company 
the direct employer of these 14 employees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> In the second place, even if such 
conclusion is reached and the 14 employees be deemed regular employees of 
respondent company, their dismissal, not having been shown in the least manner 
to be connected with union affiliation or activities cannot be considered an 
unfair labor practice, and therefore, not a valid ground for a strike.<br><br>We 
agree with petitioners that respondent NLRC gravely abused its discretion in 
concluding that the increase in the area sales quota of union president Leones 
was not an act of discrimination.&nbsp; The NLRC found the increase in the area sales 
quota justified by the change in the sales organization.&nbsp; It, however, 
overlooked a very important and crucial factor:&nbsp; that unlike the other field 
representatives whose quotas were increased by an average of 98%, that of the 
union president and vice-president were increased 400% and 300%, respectively.&nbsp; 
No valid explanation was advanced by respondent company for such marked 
difference.&nbsp; Considered in the light of the anti-union attitude exhibited by 
respondent company in transferring union president Leones from the main office 
in Manila to Cebu when the union was still being organized, and which act was 
found by the NLRC as constituting unfair labor practice and union-busting in 
connection with the application for clearance to terminate Leones filed by 
respondent company,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the uneven 
application of its marketing plan by respondent company is patently an act of 
discrimination, considered as an unfair labor practice under Art. 249[e] of the 
Labor Code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>"It has previously been indicated that an employer may 
treat freely with an employee and is not obliged to support his actions with a 
reason or purpose.&nbsp; However, where the attendant circumstances, the history of 
employer's past conduct and like considerations, coupled with an intimate 
connection between the employer's action and the union affiliations or 
activities of the particular employee or employees taken as a whole raise a 
suspicion as to the motivation for the employer's action, the failure of the 
employer to ascribe a valid reason therefore may justify an inference that his 
unexplained conduct in respect of the particular employee or employees was 
inspired by the latter's union membership or activities.&nbsp; While the presence of 
this mere suspicion neither takes the place of evidence that the employer's 
conduct was improperly motivated nor dispenses with the requirement of proof of 
the fact, such suspicion, when coupled with other facts which in themselves, 
might have been inadequate to support an adverse finding against the employer, 
may suffice to sustain a finding that the employer's action violated the 
prohibition of the Act."</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The contempt charge against petitioner union, KMU and Nick 
Elman was predicated mainly on the statement appearing in the circular 
apparently authored by Nick Elman, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify"><em>"It is an open secret, that most of the Supreme Court 
Justices belong to the upper privileged class and some of them belonged at one 
time or another, to law firms that serve the interest of giant transnational 
corporations as corporate counsels and retainers and this ruling merely 
confirmed the perceived apparent pro-multinational, pro-capital, anti-labor, 
anti-union and anti-strike posture of personalities in the Supreme 
Court."</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">and on the fact that at the time the picket was staged, the 
case was still sub judice.<br><br><em>Oliveros v. Villaluz</em>, 57 SCRA 163, is 
but one of the numerous authorities enunciating the principle that "the power to 
punish for contempt should be used sparingly, with caution, deliberation and 
with due regard to the provisions of the law and the constitutional rights of 
the individual." On this basis, We clear the alleged contemptors of the charge 
against them.<br><br>To our mind, the statements complained of are mere 
expressions of opinion intended not so much to bring the Court in disrepute as 
to advance the cause of labor.&nbsp; It must be noted that the picket was staged only 
eight <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> months after the EDSA 
Revolution which saw the ouster of the past dispensation and the restoration of 
the basic rights to the people.&nbsp; Freedom of speech, much repressed during the 
previous regime, had only begun to take wings again.&nbsp; Taken against this 
background, We understand the overzealousness demonstrated by the KMU and Nick 
Elman in exercising their freedom of speech and expression and are inclined to 
give more weight to said constitutional rights than to the Court's inherent 
power to preserve its dignity to which the power to punish for contempt 
appertains.<br><br>Although the picket was staged when the motion for leave to 
file a final and last motion for reconsideration was still pending action by the 
Court, the KMU and Nick Elman, not being parties to the case, were unaware of 
such fact.&nbsp; They believed the case to have been finally disposed of in view of 
the final denial of the first motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; On the other hand, 
there is no sufficient proof that petitioner union had participated in the 
picket nor in the preparation of the circular under 
consideration.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is hereby 
granted.&nbsp; The decision of the NLRC dated December 27, 1985 in NCR-9-3217-84 is 
set aside and the strike staged by petitioner union is declared to be legal.&nbsp; 
Respondent company AHS/Philippines, Inc. is hereby found guilty of unfair labor 
practices.&nbsp; Since reinstatement of individual petitioners is no longer possible 
in view of the cessation of its operations in the Philippines, respondent
