waiting for about ten minutes, Mrs. Plata Luzon and her husband arrived (id;

alighted from the jeep. The accused, on the pretext of answering a call of
nature, walked ahead followed by <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Mercado. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 'G'). The deceased, followed
by <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> and by <span class="SpellE">Galon</span>, walked
farther behind. When the accused was a little further ahead, on a pre-arranged
signal, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Galon</span> struck the deceased with a
lead pipe at the back. The deceased was stunned and as he was falling down, <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> stabbed him repeatedly, separately on the chest, nape

him, inflicting a total of nine (9) wounds (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,

Mercado tried to convince the accused to come with them and return to Manila. But
the accused refused to go with them saying that she will pretend that she and

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Accused-appellant claims
that the trial court erred: (1) in giving full credence and weight to the
uncorroborated testimony of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Mercado; (2) in
ruling that the issue of credibility of Mercado should be affirmatively
resolved in his favor since he pleaded guilty to the charge of murder to the
exclusion of other relevant factors; (3) in not finding as a fact that <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Mercado had been blackmailing the accused and had
demanded P10,000.00 from the accused, otherwise, he will implicate her in the
murder of her husband; (4) in not giving credence to the testimony of the
accused; (5) in failing to rule that the testimony of Mercado does not
constitute clear and convincing evidence on the alleged conspiracy; and, (6) in
not acquitting the accused on reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As already stated, the
trial court convicted the accused-appellant for parricide. The main issue
raised by appellant in this case is the matter of credibility. The trial court
rejected the testimony of appellant that she had no participation in the
slaying of her husband and that they were robbed by her co-accused in an
isolated place and when her husband would not give them the money, they slew
him with a bladed weapon until he finally succumbed to death. On the other
hand, the trial court gave more weight and believed the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> Mercado and Salvador <span class="SpellE">Galon</span>
who confessed their guilt in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span>
Luzon and who pointed to <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span> Luzon as the
person who engaged their services to kill the deceased on a promise of a reward

<p class="BODY">With these admissions in open court how can appellant now claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">that </span>she does not even know her
