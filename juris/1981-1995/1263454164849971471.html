<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>
filed a verified Complaint for Disbarment against respondent Atty. Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> alleging that the following circumstances warranted
his exclusion from the Roll of Attorneys:</p>

<blockquote>"On 22 August 1977 (should be 11 August 1977), C o m p l a <span class="SpellE">i</span> n a n t CHING UY SENG a ROBERT CHING received a letter
from Respondent Atty. JOSE C. MAGAT, threatening to report him to the
government authorities if he would not get in touch with him (MAGAT) and his
clients with respect to a bunch of documents and papers pertaining to
Complainants' business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such documents
turned out to be a part of the articles which were stolen from the office/resi­dence
of Complainants on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="6">2 June 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="8">13 August 1977</st1:date>, UY CHUNG GUAN SENG a HENTRY
CHING; his lawyer, Atty. ELISEO LEGASPI; and NBI Agent RODOLFO DAHIROC went to
the office of Atty. MAGAT at Room 512 Madrigal Bldg., <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, in response to the
above-mentioned letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. MAGAT
initially de­manded the sum of P500,000.00 in exchange for the robbed
documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>CHING, LEGASPI and Agent
DAHIROC insisted on seeing the documents first and to talk with Atty. <span class="SpellE">MAGAT's</span> clients before they negotiate the terms of the
return of the documents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The meeting was
reset on 15 August 1977 at 3:00 p.m., during which Atty. MAGAT informed them
that their demand was reduced to P300,000.00 on a 'take it or leave it'
basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">MAGAT's</span>
'clients' who brought in the robbed documents turned out to be the suspects in
the robbery of the office/residence of Complainants on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="6">2 June 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. MAGAT insisted that HENRY CHING produce P30,000.00 to show his
good faith in pushing through with the negotiation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at this juncture that the NBI Agents
confronted the group and brought them to the NBI office together with the
robbed documents for investigation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Required to comment, respondent alleged that there was absolutely
no truth to the charge imputed to him; that the incident became the subject of
a criminal charge for Light Threats filed by the NBI Agents with the Office of
the Fiscal of Manila (IS No. 77-26882), which, after preliminary investigation,
was dropped for "utter insufficiency of evidence"; and that after the
lapse of more than one year from the date of said criminal complaint,
complainants through Atty. <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
reopened the case before this Tribunal merely to harass him and assail his
character and conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent prayed
that the complaint be dismissed for utter lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1979</st1:date>,
upon consideration of the Com­plaint and the Comment, this Court resolved to
suspend respondent from the practice of law effective imme­diately upon notice,
and until further orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
further resolved to refer the case to the Solicitor General for investigation.</p>

front of the Lyric Theater.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> conferred
about the letter and the latter told the former that he will communicate with
his client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
also told Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> to come back on August 13
(pp. 94-98, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1979</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the deve­lopment, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> wrote on August 12, 1977 a letter to the Director
of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI for short) seeking assistance 'by
way of assigning one of your Agents in my planned conference with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> tomor­row' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D, p. 29,
Records; pp. 28-29, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conformably
with the request, the NBI assigned Agent Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
to assist Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> (p. 32, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 13, 1977, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>, and complain­ant <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>, also known as Henry <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, went to the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
at Rm. 512 Madrigal Build­ing to negotiate about the contents of the letter Exhibit
'C', but the group of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Cruz mentioned in
the letter did not arrive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> asked Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> who
Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> was, he being then dressed in
T-shirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
introduced Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> as his assistant (p.
102,t.s.n., July 9, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> told <span class="SpellE">Atty.Legaspi</span> to return
on August 15 (p. 35, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 6, 1979).</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1977</st1:date>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> accompanied by
Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> and Henry <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>,
again went to the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the place, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> told the trio that the group of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
Cruz will arrive at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> that
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While waiting for the group
of <span class="SpellE">Feli­cisimo</span> Cruz to arrive, conversation ensued,
during which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> demanded P500,000.00 for the
return of the documents mentioned in the letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This amount was reduced to P300,000.00, with
the request, however, that an ad­vance payment of P30,000.00 be made to show
good faith; upon paying the ba­lance, all the documents will be re­turned (pp.
35-37, id.; pp.260-261, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 23, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly there­after <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
Cruz and his group arrived, bringing along with them two sacks of invoices and
papers and the black portfolio of <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> showed <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> the folder or plastic bag containing papers and the
portfolio to verify whether those were really their papers (pp. 37-38, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n.,</span><st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="7"><span class="SpellE">July</span> 6, 1979</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It turned out that the per­son introduced as <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
Cruz is Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>, the driver of com­plainant
Robert <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, who absconded with P40,000.00 owned by
Robert <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> on <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1976</st1:date> (p. 39, id.), and who had sent a letter
to <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1977</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
L and L-1) admitting participation in the robbery committed at the latter's
office on June 2, 1977 in which papers and docu­ments pertaining to their
business, among other things, were taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rodol­fo <span class="SpellE">Salita's</span> companions were Jesus <span class="SpellE">Salita</span> and his brother-in-law Robert <span class="SpellE">Rajotte</span>
(pp. 39-40, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the group of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>,
alias <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Cruz, arrived with the documents subject
of the negotiation, and after verification of sample documents, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> com­municated secretly with Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> to get reinforcements and then in a loud voice
ordered <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> to get the P30,000.00 being demanded
by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> as earnest-money (p. 40, id.; p. 135, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 9, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whereupon <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span>
and Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> left Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat's</span>
office and went down­stairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Chung Guan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> proceeded to
the Insular Bank of <st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in <span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span>, pretending to get the money there,
while Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> went to get reinforcements (p.
40, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 6, 1979; pp. 262­-264, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 23, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a few minutes, Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> and the
reinforcements arrived and they placed Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>,
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>, Robert <span class="SpellE">Rajotte</span>
and a certain Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Villagracia</span> under arrest; they
also seized the articles and documents brought by Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>
and his group (p. 41-42, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 6, 1979; p.
357, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 25, 1979; pp. 383-384, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 27, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>, after introducing himself as an
NBI agent, apprised Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> that the documents
seized were the subject of a robbery case and that from the tenor of the
letter, Exhibit 'C', there was a case of extortion against respondent (pp.
358-359, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1979</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> then invited Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> to go to the NBI for investigation (p. 359-361,
id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
pleaded that as a brother in the profession, he wanted to talk with him 'on a
personal level', so he in­vited Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> to go
with him to the Kentucky Cocktail Lounge which was near his office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
acceded because the other persons arrested were already in the custody of the
other NBI agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the Kentucky Cock­tail
Lounge, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> told Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
that if the latter wanted to, they can make some money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
answered that there was no money in the documents because they had been brought
to the attention of the government and that there was a complaint for
robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
further told Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> that there was no way for
them 'to have a happy agreement', so the former brought the latter back to the
office (pp. 362­-363, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1979</st1:date>; pp. 386-387, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1979</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the office, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
insisted on his right not to go to the NBI, so Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span>
call­ed up the NBI Regional Director and informed him of the unwillingness of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> to go with the group to the NBI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a compromise, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
was allowed to remain after he had pre­pared and signed a written undertaking
that he would report to the NBI office the following day for questioning re­garding
the matter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. Q, p. 37, Records; pp. 364-366, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="7">July 25,
 1979</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to his
written promise, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> did not report to the
NBI Office (p. 367, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> prepared an in­ventory of
all the articles and documents seized during the raid at the office of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S); NBI photographers
took pictures of the office of respond­ent where the raid took place, as well
as of the persons arrested and the ar­ticles seized (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
F, G, H, I, J, and K; pp. 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 73, Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August
 19, 1977</st1:date>, Agents Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Da­hiroc</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cotaco</span> submitted their
written report on the incident in question (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. R,
pp. 7-14, Records; pp. 367-371, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their conversation during
one of his meetings with Agent <span class="SpellE">Dahiroc</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> told
the duo that as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> and his group
in the transaction, his share would be one-third (1/3) of the amount which they
would receive from the com­plainants (pp. 402-404, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
July 27, 1979).</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>
admits that he wrote and sent the letter, Exhibit 'C', to complainant Robert <span class="SpellE">Ching</span> but he claims that he prepared the same at the
request of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Cruz after being shown sales
invoices of A-1 Photo Litho, a firm managed by Robert <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>,
and after noticing discrepancies in the amounts appearing in the originals and
in the duplicates of said in­voices (pp. 7-8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
July 30, 1979).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also admits that on <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1977</st1:date>, he showed Atty. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> the sample of the sales invoice of the A-1 Photo
Litho containing the anomalous discrepancies aforementioned (p. 13,id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He, however, denies that he demanded the
amounts mentioned by the witnesses for the complainants because what he did was
merely to con­vey the demands of his clients (pp. 18-23, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The actuations of respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span> constitute malpractice and gross misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Writing and sending the letter Exhibit C and
demanding from the complainants the amount of P500,000.00, later on reduced to
P300,000.00, with P30,000.00 as down-payment to show good faith, in consi­deration
for the return of anomalous invoices and documents, is highly
reprehensible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such acts constitute not
only threat but extortion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respond­ent's
protestations of good faith in sending the letter to the complainants are not
convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If indeed he had no ulterior
motive, he should have referred the documents brought by <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>
and his companions directly to the BIR instead of addressing a letter with a
veiled threat to the complainants and having the letter delivered per­sonally
to them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even assuming as true the allegation of respondent that he did not
actually demand the amounts mentioned above for himself but that he merely conveyed
the demands made by the group of <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Cruz,
such act is still <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of an attorney's
oath.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For then, respondent assisted his
clients in a scheme which he knows to be dishonest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that the docu­ments presented by <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span> Cruz to him are proof that the government has
been unlawfully deprived of much need­ed taxes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As testified to by him, re­spondent, after verifying the invoices, was
convinced that the A-1 Litho and <span class="SpellE">and</span> Photo Engraving
was cheating the government (pp. 83-84, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He knew too that the desire of Cruz and his group to extort money from
the complainants in exchange for the anomalous documents was illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite such knowledge and awareness, he
connived with his clients in violating the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And for what?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in
consideration of the one-third share he would receive from the proceeds of the
transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assistance he extended
to his clients' dishonest scheme and his connivance with them in violating the
law render the re­spondent guilty of unprofessional conduct which warrants his
disbarment or suspen­sion.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The promoting of organizations, with knowledge of their objects,
for the purpose of violating or evading the laws against crime constitutes such
misconduct on the part of an attorney, an officer of the court, as amounts to
malpractice or gross misconduct in his office, and for which he may be removed
or suspended (Code of Civil Procedure, sec. 21).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The assisting of a client in a scheme
which the attorney knows to be dishonest, or the conniving at a violation of
law, are acts which justify disbarment</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(In Re <span class="SpellE">Terrel</span>, 2 Phil. 266, 267-268;
Underlining supplied).</p>

<blockquote>10. The grounds for
disbarment or suspension enumerated in the statute should not be taken as a
limitation of the general power of the courts to disbar or suspend a
lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the power of the court over
its officers cannot be restricted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
lawyer may be removed not only for malpractice or dishonesty in his profession
but also for his gross misconduct which shows him to be unfit for the office
and unworthy of the privileges which the law confers upon him (In Re <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, 19 SCRA 439).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It has been repeatedly ruled that the purpose of disbarment is to
protect the courts and the public from the misconduct of officers of the court and
to ensure the adminis­tration of justice by requiring that those who exercise
this important function shall be competent, honor­able and trustworthy men in
whom courts and clients may repose confi­dence (Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Dichosa</span>,
84 SCRA 622).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
respondent has not exercised honesty and trust­worthiness and has failed to
live up to the high standards of the law pro­fession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of a member of the bar to
avoid all appearances of impropriety and his actuations should be beyond suspicion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is true that an attorney enjoys the legal presumption of inno­cence
until the contrary is proved, but this presumption has been rebutted by the
clear and convincing evidence presented by the complainants and their
witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The actuations of respondent constitute attempted extortion
although what was filed against him in the Office of the City Fiscal of Manila
was only for light threats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course,
respond­ent was able to show that the charge for light threats lodged against
him was dismissed, as shown by the memoran­dum of Assistant Fiscal Billy M. <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> and the memorandum of 2nd Assistant City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> recommending the
dismissal of the charge of light threats filed against him (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
2, 2-A, 2-B &amp; 3, pp. 81-84, Rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the dismissal of the criminal complaint against respond­ent does not
preclude his disbarment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even granting
that the acts committed by him may not be sufficient to make him criminally
liable, the same nevertheless constitute gross misconduct and/or mal­practice,
which are grounds for disbarment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the purpose of disbarment, as stated above, is not to punish
the offender but to protect the courts and the public from his pernicious
activities.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not amiss to mention at this juncture that respondent is facing
two other administrative cases before this Honorable Court, filed by his own
cousins, one involving an affidavit notarized by him and the other an ans­wer
to a complaint prepared and filed by him in a certain case (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
