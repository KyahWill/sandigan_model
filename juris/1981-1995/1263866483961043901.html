				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This seven-year-old case involves a claim for benefits for the
death of a lady school teacher which the public respondents disallowed on the
ground that the cause of death was not work-connected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before her death on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="2">February
 19, 1982</st1:date>, petitioner’s wife, <span class="SpellE">Oania</span> <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, was a classroom teacher of the Department of
Education, Culture and Sports assigned at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Buracan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>
(p. 13, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She had been a classroom teacher since <st1:date year="1971" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1971</st1:date>, or for eleven (11) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her husband, the petitioner, is also a public
school teacher.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1982</st1:date>,
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o’clock</st1:time> in the morning, while
performing her duties as a classroom teacher, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>
who was in her 8th month of pregnancy, accidentally slipped and fell on the
classroom floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moments later, she
complained of abdominal pain and stomach cramps.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For several days, she continued to suffer
from recurrent abdominal pain and a feeling of heaviness in her stomach, but,
heedless of the advice of her female co-teachers to take a leave of absence,
she continued to report to the school because there was much work to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="1">January
 25, 1982</st1:date>, eleven (11) days after her accident, she went into labor
and prematurely delivered a baby girl at home (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Her abdominal pains persisted even after the delivery,
accompanied by high fever and headache.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Alino</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> in <span class="SpellE">Dimasalang</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Alino</span>
found that she was suffering from septicemia post partum due to infected
lacerations of the vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
discharged from the hospital after five (5) days on <st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1982</st1:date>, apparently recovered, but she
died three (3) days later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of
death was septicemia post partum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was 33 years old, survived by her husband and four (4) children, the oldest of
whom was 11 years old and the youngest, her new-born infant (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1983</st1:date>,
a claim for death benefits was filed by her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1984</st1:date>, it was denied by the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS) which held that “septicemia post partum, the cause of death, is not an
occupational disease, and neither was there any showing that aforesaid ailment
was contracted by reason of her employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged accident mentioned could not have
precipitated the death of the wife but rather the result of the infection of
her lacerated wounds as a result of her delivery at home” (p. 14, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Employees Compensation Commission, the latter
issued Resolution No. 3913 dated <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="7">July
 8, 1988</st1:date> holding:</p>

<p class="2Q">“We agree with the decision of the system, hence we dismiss this
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Post-partum septicemia is an
acute infectious disease of the <span class="SpellE">puerperium</span> resulting
from the entrance into the blood of bacteria <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">usually streptococci and their toxins which cause dissolution of the
blood, degenerative changes in the organs and the symptoms of
intoxication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of this
condition in the instant case was the infected vaginal lacerations resulting
from the decedent’s delivery of her child which took place at home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged accident in school could not have
been the cause of septicemia, which in this case is clearly caused by factors
not inherent in employment or in the working conditions of the deceased.” <span class="GramE">(pp. 14-15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for review.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful consideration of the petition and the annexes
thereof, as well as the comments of the public respondents, we are persuaded
that the public respondents’ peremptory denial of the petitioner’s claim
constitutes a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule III, Section 1 of the Amended Rules on Employees’
Compensation enumerates the grounds for compensability of injury resulting in
disability or death of an employee, as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">“SECTION 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Grounds - (a) For the injury and the resulting
disability or death to be compensable, the injury must be the result of an <u>employment
accident</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">satisfying all of the
following conditions:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The</span> employee must have been injured at the place where his
work requires him to be;</p>

<p class="2Q">“(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employee must
have been performing his official functions; and</p>

<p class="2Q">“(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the injury is
sustained elsewhere, the employee must have been executing an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">order for the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the sickness
and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, the sickness must be
the result of an occupational disease listed under Annex ‘A’ of these Rules
with the conditions set therein satisfied; otherwise, proof must be shown that
the risk of contracting the disease is increased<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> by the working conditions.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Only</span> injury or sickness that occurred on or after <st1:date year="1975" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1975</st1:date> and the resulting
disability or death shall be compensable under these Rules.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The illness, septicemia post partum, which resulted in the death
of <span class="SpellE">Oania</span> <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, is
admittedly not listed as an occupational disease in her particular line of work
as a classroom teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as
pointed out in the petition, her death from that ailment is compensable because
an employment accident and the conditions of her employment contributed to its
development.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The condition of the
classroom floor caused Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span> to slip and
fall and suffer injury as a result.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
fall precipitated the onset of recurrent abdominal pains which culminated in
the premature termination of her pregnancy with tragic consequences to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her fall on the classroom floor brought about
her premature delivery which caused the development of post partum septicemia
which resulted in death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her fall
therefore was the proximate or responsible cause that set in motion an unbroken
chain of events, leading to her demise.</p>

<p class="2Q">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> what is
termed in American cases the proximate cause, not implying however, as might be
inferred from the word itself, the nearest in point of time or relation, but
rather, [is] the efficient cause, which may be the most remote of an operative
chain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be that which sets the
others in motion and is to be distinguished from a mere<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> preexisting condition upon which the effective cause operates, and
must have been adequate to produce the </span>resultant damage <u>without</u> <u>the</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">intervention</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>of</u> <u>an</u> <u>independent</u> <u>cause</u>.”

<p class="2Q">“The proximate legal cause is that acting first and producing the
injury, either immediately or by setting other events in motion, all
constituting a natural and continuous chain of events, each having a close
causal connection with its immediate predecessor, the final event in the chain
immediately effecting the injury as a natural <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">and probable result of the cause which first acted, under such
circumstances that the person responsible for the first event should, as an
ordinarily prudent and intelligent person, have reasonable ground to expect at
the moment of his act or default that an injury to some person might probably
result <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.” (<span class="SpellE">Bataclan</span>
v. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Medina</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, 102 Phil. 181.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus in Enriquez v. WCC, 93 SCRA 366, 372, this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily,
the right to compensation extends to disability due to disease supervening upon
and proximately and naturally resulting from a compensable injury (82 Am. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Jur</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">. 132).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the primary injury is shown to have arisen in the course of
employment, every natural consequence that flows from the injury likewise
arises out of the employment, unless it is the result of an independent
intervening cause attributable to claimant’s own negligence or misconduct (I
Larson Workmen’s Compensation Law 3-279 [1972]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simply stated, all the medical consequences
and sequels that flow from the primary injury are compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ibid.)”</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Belarmino’s</span>
fall was the primary injury that arose in the course of her employment as a
classroom teacher, hence, all the medical consequences flowing from it:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>her recurrent abdominal pains, the premature
delivery of her baby, her septicemia post partum, and death, are compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the public respondents’ argument that the
cause of the decedent’s post partum septicemia “was the infected vaginal
lacerations resulting from the decedent’s delivery of her child at home” for
the incident in school could not have caused septicemia post partum, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> if the necessary precautions
to avoid infection during or after labor were (not) taken” (p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It overlooks the fact that septicemia post partum is a disease of
childbirth, and premature childbirth would not have occurred if she did not
accidentally fall in the classroom.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that if she had delivered her baby under sterile
conditions in a hospital operating room instead of in the <span class="SpellE">unsterile</span>
environment of her humble home, and if she had been attended by specially
trained doctors and nurses, she probably would not have suffered lacerations of
the vagina and she probably would not have contracted the fatal infection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, if she had remained longer than
five (5) days in the hospital to complete the treatment of the infection, she
probably would not have died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But who is
to blame for her inability to afford a hospital delivery and the service of
trained doctors and nurses?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
may take judicial notice of the meager salaries that the Government pays its
public school teachers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Forced to live
on the margin of poverty, they are unable to <span class="GramE">afford expensive</span>
hospital care, nor the services of trained doctors and nurses when they or
members of their families are ill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Penury compelled the deceased to scrimp by delivering her baby at home
instead of in a hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Government is not entirely blameless for her death for it is
not entirely blameless for her poverty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Government has yet to perform its declared policy “to free the people
from poverty, provide adequate social services, extend to them a decent
standard of living, and improve the quality of life for all (Sec. 7, Art. <span class="GramE">II, 1973 Constitution and Sec. 9, Art.</span> II, 1987
Constitution).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Social justice for the
lowly and underpaid public school teachers will only be an empty shibboleth
until Government adopts measures to ameliorate their economic condition and
provides them with adequate medical care or the means to afford it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Compassion for the poor is an imperative of
every humane society” (PLDT v. <span class="SpellE">Bucay</span> and NLRC, 164
SCRA 671, 673).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By their denial of the
petitioner’s claim for benefits arising from the death of his wife, the public
respondents ignored this imperative of Government, and thereby committed a
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents Employees
Compensation Commission and the Government Service Insurance System are ordered
to pay death benefits to the petitioner and/or the dependents of the late <span class="SpellE">Oania</span> <span class="SpellE">Belarmino</span>, with legal rate
of interest from the filing of the claim until it is fully paid, plus
attorney’s fees equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the award, and costs of
