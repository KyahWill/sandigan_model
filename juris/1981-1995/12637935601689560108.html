<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in Civil Case No. 5013 based its decision upon
consideration of the following findings of fact:</p>

<blockquote>"Counsel for the plaintiffs presented plaintiff Andres <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> as his sole witness who testified to the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That he and his wife are the absolute owners and possessors of Lot
No. 3720-C, which is a portion of Lot No. 3720 of the Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>, evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No.
19916 (Exhibit "A"); that said parcel of land was originally owned
and possessed by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Cecilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, and after their death, Andres and <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> being the only
heirs took possession of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1959, Andres <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span> bought the rights, interests
and parti­cipation of his brother, <span class="SpellE">Cirilo</span> over the
property for the sum of P300.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, it was only in 1964 when they actually executed the deed of
extra-judicial partition and sale (Exhibit "B" and “B-1”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From 1959, plaintiffs had been in actual and
peaceful possession of the entire Lot No. 3720-C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had also paid the land taxes <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (Exhibits "C","C-1" to
'C-4").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, he caused
the pro­perty to be declared in his name (Exhibit “C?5)”</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the lifetime of <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, mother of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
</span>the plaintiff Andres <span class="SpellE">Arboleda</span>, she allowed her
<span class="SpellE">sister,Pamfila</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span> to
cons­truct a house on the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later on, when the daughter of <span class="SpellE">Pamfila</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, defendant Luisa <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
had a family of her own, she also constructed a house on the land in question
without the knowledge and consent of the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other defendants, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
who are also the children of Luisa <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> constructed
their houses on the land in question, also without the knowledge and consent of
the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In like manner,
defendant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, a son of a brother of <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, cons­tructed
his house on the land of the plaintiffs without their knowledge and
consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For huma­nitarian
considerations and because of the closeness of their blood relationship, the
plaintiffs tolerated the stay of the defendants on the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in 1966, the defendants began destroying
the improvements on the land, like the barbed wire fence and had harvested the
produce <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and asserted ownership over the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To protect their interest, the
plaintiffs brought the matter to the attention of the administrative
authorities of <span class="SpellE">Guino­batan</span> and the PC, and exhausted
all avenues for an amicable settlement with the defendants, but the latter completely
ignored and disregarded all attempts to settle the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs then went to Atty. Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Reantaso</span> for advice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Reantaso</span> wrote the defendants to vacate
the premises (Exhibits 'D', 'D-1" to “D-3', inclusive), which were all
sent by registered mail (Exhibits "D-4' to 'D-7', inclu­sive).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, the defendants ignored the re­quest of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Reantaso</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Because of the unwarranted acts of the, <span class="SpellE">defedants</span>,
the plaintiffs had spent more than P1,000.00 for litigation expenses plus the
sum of P600.00 which he paid his lawyer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants in their answer aver that <span class="SpellE">Pamfila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>, mother of defendants Roberto, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> and Luisa, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
is the co-heir of <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Brillante</span>
and that the plaintiffs had fraudulently secured the title of the land to the
exclusion of the defendants who are co-heirs of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendants however failed to include or
attach in their answer any documents to support their claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, if the defendants really did
have some documents to support their claim of being co-heirs to the property,
during the time that the plaintiffs were asking for an amicable settlement when
they were called by the administrative authorities, namely, the PC, the Station
Commander of the <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span> Police Station and the
Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Guino­batan</span>, they should have
presented the same, to end once and for all their dispute being blood
relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Reantaso</span> wrote them, the defendants did not inform him that
they are co-heirs to the property and therefore cannot be ejected from the <span class="SpellE">premmises</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
defendants just completely ignored and dis­regarded the invitation to settle,
thus prompting the belief that they have no document on which to support their
claim of being co-heirs to the property in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In view of the foregoing, the Court has no other alternative since
the evidence on hand points to the legitimacy and lawful ownership of the
property in question described under paragraph 2 of the complaint to the
plaintiffs, except to declare the plaintiffs rightful owners of the same.” (pp.
23-25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendants' motion for reconsideration was denied and
consequently upon motion of plaintiffs, a writ of execution was issued ordering
defendants to vacate the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, defendants, thru their lawyer, Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes, filed a petition for relief from judgment
reiterating substantially the same ground relied upon in their motion for
reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding the petition to
be merely a rehash of the previous motion for reconsideration and that the same
was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the court
denied said petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1977</st1:date>,
defendants in Civil Case No. 5013 instituted Civil Case No. 5643 for the

heirs of the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said

thus resulting in the resetting of the pre-trial to <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When this case was called for pre-trial on September 3, 1976 only the
plaintiffs (private respondents herein) and their counsel appeared
notwithstanding the fact that all the defendants received due notice as
evidenced by the registered return cards signed by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On motion of counsel for the plaintiffs, the
defendants were declared in default and thus plain­tiffs were allowed to
present evidence <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> before the court on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1976</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of evidence presented in said
hearing, the trial court rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now argue that they were denied due process, and that
consequently the judgment in Civil Case No. 5013 must be rendered null and
void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such argument merits no
consideration in the light of the foregoing paragraph.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment rendered in Civil Case No. 5013 is in­deed founded
upon the evidence adduced by the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the trial court in said <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">case </span>proceeded to hear evidence <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> can only be attributed to petitioners'
fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus in the order, dated January
10, 1977 of the trial court in Civil Case No. 5013 denying the motion for
reconsideration, said court declares that:</p>

<blockquote>“Submitted for resolution is the motion for reconsideration filed
by defendant Luisa <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> herself and the opposition
thereto by counsel for the plaintiffs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for reconsideration is to the effect that the deci­sion in
this case was premised on the ground that the defendants, despite due notice,
did not appear during the pre-trial on September 3, 1976, at 8:30 in the
morning; that the de­fendants on September 3, 1976 at 8:30 in the morning
really appeared in Branch I of this Court up to 11:00 o'clock in the morning,
when one of the clerks in Branch I called their at­tention that the pre-trial
of this case will be in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Branch III; that without
de­lay, the defendants proceeded to Branch III, but Branch III had adjourned;
and that in jus­tice, to the herein defendants, they be given a chance to be
heard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is very unfortunate indeed that the defendants did not
secure the services of coun­sel in filing their answer and during the sche­duled
pre-trial of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise
unfortunate that they did not seek the services of counsel in filing the
instant motion for reconsideration in order that they could be well informed of
the requirements of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Be that as it may, the ground relied upon by the defendants,
even without touching on the technicalities imposed by the Rules, cannot merit
any consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, the decision
was not based on the ground that the defendants did not appear during the
pre-trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deci­sion in this case
was rendered after a proper hearing before the Presiding Judge of this Court,
with the plaintiffs presenting oral and documentary evidence to support their
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, the Court cannot believe
that any emplo­yee of this Court will misled the defendants by directing them
to proceed to Branch III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the defendant themselves have pre­pared the answer as well as the motion for re­consideration,
it is safe to assume that the defendants are intelligent enough to know that
this case pertains to Branch I of this Court and not Branch III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, in their motion for
reconsideration, they captioned the same as pertaining to Branch I.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the foregoing discussions, and considering
that the motion for reconsidera­tion and for new trial does not comply with the
requirements of the Rules of Court, the instant motion is DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (pp. 55-56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the trial court was liberal in granting several
postponements of the pre-trial confe­rences before it was prompted to declare
petitioners in during the hearing on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="9">September
 10, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated,

No. 5013 had no jurisdiction over the subject matter and parties, or that the

<p class="BODY">The finality of the decision in Civil Case No. 5013 is not to be
