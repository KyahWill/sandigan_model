convicting the brothers, RAYMUNDO Araja and RODING Araja, of Murder, qualified
by treachery, and sentencing each one to suffer </span><i>reclusion perpetua</i><span style="">, </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">indemnify the heirs

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Information, dated
December 17, 1962, charged the </span><span style="">two

did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and fire
shots several times at the said </span>Apolonio Aquino <span style="">with the said firearms, thereby inflicting upon him several gunshot
wounds in the different parts of his body which caused his death; that the
crime was committed </span>with the <span style="">aggravating
cir­cumstances of abuse of superior strength, use of unlicensed firearms and
nocturnity deliberately sought."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Apolonio Aquino (the
deceased, for short), 20, single, was a resident of Barrio Payapa, Lemery, </span><span style="">Batangas.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">His friend, Epifanio
Umali, 22, single, farmer, was a resident of the same barrio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, as principal prosecution witness,
testified that in the afternoon of November 29, 1962, he and the deceased
boarded the last trip of the BTCo. bus from Barrio Payapa, bound for Barrio San
Gabriel, Talisay, Batangas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
arriving at their destination at 6:00 P.M., they proceeded to the house of the
deceased's friend (whose name he did not know) where they ate supper and stayed
for an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five friends of the
deceased from Barrio San Gabriel were already there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 8:00 P.M., accompanied by those friends,
they proceeded to the house of Purok Araja, father of the accused brothers, to
serenade Purok's niece and the accused's first degree cousin, Gregoria Bathan,
also from Barrio Payapa, whom the deceased </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">courting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the
deceased's father, Catalino Aquino, Gregoria's parents did not approve of that
courtship </span><span style="">but </span><span style="">were in favor of another man, Jovito
Gamboa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it was because of this that
Gregoria was taken to Barrio San Gabriel by her parents in order to keep her
away from the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Continuing with Epifanio
Umali's narration, he stated that at 10:00 P.M., on their way home after the
serenade, he and the deceased stood by with their group along the road in front
of a store owned by Leodegario Bait where one of their companions bought
cigarettes </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">all of them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the deceased was about to light <span style="">his </span>cigarette, they suddenly heard shouts </span><span style="">"<i>patay </i></span><i><span style="">kayo ngayon</span></i><span style="">".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">The deceased beamed his
flashlight towards the place where the voices came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereby, Epifanio saw both accused hold­ing
firearms and simultaneously fire shots at the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter was hit, fell with his face down </span><span style="">(<i style="">sumobasob
na</i>) and cried </span><span style="">"</span><i style="">aray</i><span style="">!" </span><span style="">Frightened,
Epifanio </span><span style="">ran away </span><span style="">towards Barrio
Tamayo and walked home to Barrio Payapa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Informed by one Baldomero
Malabanan of the shooting incident, PC soldier Victoriano Antazo pro­ceeded to
the scene of the crime where he and some companions found the deceased lying

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An ocular inspection of
the crime scene was conducted the following day by PC Sgt. Michael
Anduque.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found a flashlight and five
empty shells near the place of the incident and caused them to be turned </span><span style="">over to the </span><span style="">Office of the Provincial Fiscal, Batangas, Batangas, on December </span><span style="">18, </span><span style="">1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also declared that the
front of the store where the slaying occurred </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">approximately 500 to
700 yards from the house of Purok Araja, and about 400 to 600 yards from </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">of the accused Raymundo Araja.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He investigated Porfirio Austria, who was in the deceased's group, and
Gregoria Bathan herself, which investigations were reduced to writing.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Neither declarant, however, was presented as

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On December 27, 1962, the
deceased's body was exhumed and upon examination by Dr. Ceferino Cunanan, </span><span style="">NBI medico-legal officer, he found </span><span style="">a gunshot wound </span>on <span style="">the "lumbar </span><span style="">region, right, </span>posterior
aspect", thru and thru, exiting <span style="">at
the </span>"right hypochondriac region".<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">According to him, </span><span style="">the muzzle </span>of
the gun must have been behind the deceased for this wound to have been
caused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>second gunshot w<span style="">ound, </span><span style="">also </span><span style="">thru

Dr. Cunanan stated that this wound could have been caused while the deceased
was facing the assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also found
the deceased's "heart with blood clots" meaning that the latter could
have lived <span style="">for sometime </span>before
he died, the duration depending upon the degree of hemorrhage, which could be
an hour or more, as his wounds could not have caused instantaneous death.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In exculpation,
appellants both advanced the defense of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They denied any participation whatsoever in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">commission </span><span style="">of the crime </span><span style="">and claimed
to have been at their respective homes when the shooting occurred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Elaborating, RAYMUNDO
Araja, 23, married, farmer and resident of Bo. San Gabriel, declared that at
8:00 P.M. of November 29, 1962, while at his house, <span style="">Baldomero </span>Malabanan (his father-in-law) came with somebody from
Barrio Payapa, asking him (RAYMUNDO) to accompany them to borrow a guitar as
the group wanted to serenade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
eight serenaders, to wit, Baldomero Malabanan, Porfing, Peddy, Amador, Meddy,
Pedring and two others from Barrio Payapa whom </span><span style="">he did </span><span style="">not know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RAYMUNDO borrowed the
guitar from his father's house, where he saw his brother RODING.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group then serenaded Gregoria Bathan, his
first cousin from Barrio Payapa, who was vacationing at his father's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the serenade, Peddy, one of
the group invited him to go with them, which he did, leaving RODING
behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group proceeded to Barrio
Alas-as but he separated from them at the junction of the road, and went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While resting, he heard shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He peeped through their window, and </span>saw
<span style="">Gorio, the store owner, trying to light
the front of his store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached
the store and inquired from Gorio what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Meddy, his brother-in-law was with the
group, he and Porfing (who hid near the store) went to look for Meddy who might
have been hurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found Meddy in his
house, unhurt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As instructed by the
Deputy Barrio Lieutenant, they continued their search for whomsoever was hit
and found somebody sprawled by the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following day, November 30, 1962, he and RODING were fetched by the
PC soldiers who brought them to Macaoy, Lipa City, thence to Camp Crame for
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 2, 1962, they
were allowed to go home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But one month
later, they were arrested.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For his part, RODING
Araja, 33, married, farmer, and also a resident of Barrio San Gabriel,
testified that before the serenaders arrived, he was already in the house of
his father and remained there until they left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another group of serenaders came and it was during this second serenade
that he heard shots after which the serenaders sang a farewell song and
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span><span style="">then </span><span style="">went home to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, November 30,
1962, his father arrived and told him that Apolonio Aquino (the deceased), one
of the serenaders from Barrio <span style="">Payapa, </span>met
with an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 10:00 A.M. of the
same day, the PC soldiers took him and RAYMUNDO to Maraoy, and on December 1,
1962, to Camp Crame where something was applied to their hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they were <span style="">allowed </span>to go home.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense likewise
presented PC Major Jose C. Fernandez, Chief, Chemistry and Questioned Documents
Branch of the PC Laboratory, Camp Crame.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He declared that upon the request of Captain Eufronio Alip, Jr., the
Commanding Officer of the 122nd PC Co., Camp Malvar, Lipa City, he examined the
hands of RAYMUNDO and RODING Araja at 11:00 A.M. of December 1, 1962, for
presence of gun powder residue, by using the dephonylemine or ballistic
test.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His findings were negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared, however, that he could not
conclude therefrom whether the two suspects fired a gun or not because of such
factors as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the length of a firearm -
like a carbine or garand rifle, which if fired once or twice will seldom give
positive results because of the distance of the chamber of the gun from the
dorsal side of the hand of the firer; the washing of the hands with gasoline
before exam­ination; perspiration of the firer's hand, which can wash off gun
powder residue; the use of gloves; and even the velocity of the wind in
relation to the direction of the line of fire.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Luis Genil, a neighbor
and brother-in-law of RAYMUNDO corroborated the latter's alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recalled that at 9 o'clock in the evening
of November 29, 1962, he went to the house of RAYMUNDO but instead found there
the brothers, Berto and Julian (whose family names he could not remember) and
the wife of RAYMUNDO, who told him that RAYMUNDO was out serenading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twenty minutes later, RAYMUNDO arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they heard a volley of shots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the shots seemed to have been fired
somewhere near his house where his family was, he ran towards home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing that the store was already lighted, he
went there and saw the storeowner, Porfing Austria, and RAYMUNDO
conversing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then went with RAYMUNDO
to look for his brother-in-law, Pedro Malabanan, and upon returning to the
house of RAYMUNDO they met another brother-in-law of RAYMUNDO, who is the
Deputy Barrio Lieutenant, and who informed them of the incident.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After trial, the lower
Court rendered a verdict of guilty, as initially stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 2, 1965, appellants filed their
notice of appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In assailing the judgment
of conviction, appel­lants contend that the prosecution failed to establish
beyond reasonable doubt their identity as the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assertion is negated by the evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. When asked by Pfc. Antazo in the ante-mortem statement "<i style="">sino ang bumaril sa iyo</i>"?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the deceased answered precisely, "<i style="">ang anak ng Purok po na taga San Gabriel,
Talisay, Batangas, po.</i>" The circumstance that the deceased answered in
the singular and failed to specify appellants' names, although he knew them,
does not detract from the identification he had made considering that at the
time the declaration was taken, he was in grave and weakening condition that
the investigating PC soldier, for humanitarian reasons, deemed it more urgent
to bring him to the hospital rather than ask him for more specific details of
the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
As pointed out by the Solicitor General, the deceased, who was in the throes of
death at the <span style="">time he </span>gave the <i>ante-mortem</i><span style=""> </span>statement, could not be expected to
speak distinctly and with faultless grammar such that he could have omitted the
word <span style="">"</span><i style="">mga</i><span style="">" </span>to denote
that more than one son of Purok had shot him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"One does not hold the dying to the observance of all the niceties
of speech to which conformity is exacted from one on the stand" (Mr.
Justice Cardozo).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
deceased's reply to the next question - <span style="">"<i>ano
ang binaril sa iyo</i>?" - "<i>carbine at garand po</i>" </span>–confirmed
that he referred to and meant the two sons of Purok Araja, it being impossible
for only one person to carry and fire the two weapons at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the deceased while aboard the bus,
confided to his father that appellants, both of whom he identified by name, had
shot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased's conscious state
immediately after the shooting is borne out by the NBI medico-legal officer,
who declared that the wounds suffered by the deceased would not have caused
death<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>instantaneously but that
he could have lived an hour or more depending on the blood being lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he was physically capable of giving the
<i>ante-mortem</i><span style=""> </span>statement
taken even after the incident and at the very site thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The positive declaration
of the deceased as to the identity of his assailants, given with the
consciousness that death was imminent, is undoubtedly entitled to weight
considering the seriousness of his wounds and the fact that death supervened
shortly afterwards, thereby showing the great improbability that the deceased
would have trifled with the truth.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Contrary to the trial Court's opinion, the
deceased's dying declaration satisfied all legal requisites, </span><span style="">namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">(1) it must concern the
crime and the surround­ing circumstances of the declarant's </span><span style="">death; (2) </span><span style="">at the </span>time it was made, the declarant was under a consciousness
<span style="">of an impending </span>death; (3) the
declarant was competent a<span style="">s </span>a <span style="">witness </span>at the time the same was executed; (4) the declaration is
offered in a criminal case for <span style="">murder </span>in
which declarant was the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But even if the statement
were not admissible as an </span><i>ante-mortem</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">declaration, it may
still be con­sidered as part of the </span><i>res gestae</i><span style="">, </span><span style="">as correctly held by the trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was made immediately after the shooting incident, appears to be
natural and spontaneous and made before the deceased could contrive or devise a
plan to incriminate appellants.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense contention
that the prosecution suppressed evidence when it failed to present Porfirio
Austria and Pedro Malabanan, witnesses to the </span><i>ante-mortem</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">statement, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution believed that with the witnesses it had presented during the trial,
it had sufficiently established the guilt of appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Moreover,
</span><span style="">their testimonies would have
been merely corroborative so that there was no compelling reason for the
prosecution to still utilize them as witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, assuming that their testi­monies were material, nothing could
have prevented the defense from presenting them as their own witnesses in order
to discredit the </span><i>ante-mortem</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of suppressed evidence does
not apply when the same is equally accessible or available to the defense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense, too, makes
capital of the fact that Porfirio Austria did not mention the appellants by
name in his Statement taken on November 30, 1962,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
</span>merely <span style="">stated </span><span style="">"<i>may dalawang taong dumating galing
silangan, at kami ay kanilang dinaluhong sabay putok ng baril.</i>" </span>This
fact, however, does not prove appel­lants' innocence any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, Porfirio was not asked
for those names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And secondly, it is
possible that because of the suddenness of the occurrence, or <span style="">perhaps, because of his position in </span>relation
to the deceased, he was unable to recognize <span style="">appellants unlike Epifanio Umali who identified them <span style="">readily.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Be </span>that as it may, Porfirio Austria's statement corroborates the
evidence that two indi­viduals were the malefactors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

them so that the deceased </span></span><span style="">was
f</span>acing <span style="">appellants at the time he
was shot?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A plausible explanation is
that appellants must have </span><span style="">hit the </span><span style="">deceased</span><span style="">'</span><span style="">s</span><span style=""> hand holding the f</span><span style="">lashlight, </span><span style="">and there­after, </span><span style="">the deceased must

mark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, if the others in </span><span style="">the group </span>were not <span style="">hit at all, that
was their </span><span style="">good fortune.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, the </span><span style="">deceased </span><span style="">was the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">only
