the appeal of Apex Mining, Co., Inc. and affirming the April 15, 1987 decision
and January 14, 1988 order of the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR), respectively, declaring that the respective mining claims of
Apex Mining Co., Inc., et al., as well as Small Scale Mining Permits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Nos. </span>(X1) 04 (X-1) 05, are null and

denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy in this case involves conflicting mining claims
between herein petitioners Apex Mining Co., Inc., et al.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(APEX for short) and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span> Mining Corporation (MARCOPPER for short).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The disputed area is inside a timberland area
located at <span class="SpellE">Moncayo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
del Norte and <span class="SpellE">Cateel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Oriental, consisting of 4,941.0 hectares (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
64).</p>

<p class="BODY">MARCOPPER was one of the first mining claimants in the disputed
area, having registered its 16 claims on January 19 and 20, 1984 through the
filing of declarations of location pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 463,
otherwise known as the Mineral Resources Development Decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>MARCOPPER, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">allegedly, </span>after registering its mining claims, learned from the
central office of the Bureau of Forest Development (BFD) that the disputed area
is within an existing forest reservation known as the "<span class="SpellE">Agusan-Davao-Surigao</span>
Forest Reserve" established by Proclamation No. 369 on February 27, 1931
by then Governor General Dwight F. Davis, and realizing the invalidity of its
mining claims for having availed of a wrong procedure, abandoned its 16 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">mining claims </span>and
applied for a prospecting permit instead with the BFD on April 11, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The area covered by its application consisted
of 4,941.0 hectares overlapping its abandoned mining claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1985">July
 1, 1985</st1:date>, the BFD issued to it a Permit to Prospect No.
755-123185.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Discovering strong evidence
of mineral deposits in the area, it applied for a permit to explore with the then
Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences (BMGS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date month="3" day="10" year="1986">March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">10, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>it was issued Permit to Explore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. </span>133.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, upon verification from the records
of the BMGS, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City Mineral District Office, it
found that the area covered by its Permit to Explore No. 133 is also the
subject of several claims/declarations of APEX.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, on August 11, 1986, MARCOPPER filed with the BMGS a "Petition
for Cancellation of Mining Claims and/or Small Scale Mining Permits" against
APEX, alleging, among others and in substance, that the area covered by its
Permit to Explore No. 133 and the declarations of locations/mining claims
belonging to APEX are within an established and existing forest reservation (<span class="SpellE">Agusan-Davao-Surigao</span> Forest Reserve) under Proclamation No.
369, dated February 27, 1931, that the said mining claims/declarations of
location of APEX are invalid for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
Presidential Decree No. 463 and its implementing rules and regulations since
the acquisition of mining rights within a forest reserve is through the filing
of application for a permit to prospect with the BFD and not through
registration of declarations of location with the BMGS p. 65; O.P. Decision, p.
2).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1986, APEX filed a Motion to Dismiss <span class="SpellE">Marcopper's</span> petition, alleging, in substance, that their
mining claims are not within any established or proclaimed forest reserve, and
as such, the acquisitions of m<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ining r</span>i<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>hts<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Decision, pp. 11-12).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">APEX filed a motion for reconsideration, but the same was denied
on <st1:date month="11" day="16" year="1989">November 16, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, after the parties had submitted the required
pleadings, in its resolution of <st1:date month="8" day="7" year="1990">August
 7, 1990</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 637), resolved to give due course to the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">issue </span>in
this case is whether or not the disputed area is within an established and
existing forest reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the petitioners' argument is that the subject area
is not situated within a forest reserve and that Proclamation No. 369 did not
establish a forest reservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said
proclamation merely withdrew from settlement or disposition certain tracts of
land described therein situated in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did so on the basis of Section 8 of Act
No. 2874, otherwise known as "the Public Land Act", which was
promulgated on <st1:date year="1919" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1919</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 654-657).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Proclamation No. 369 could not have, as a matter of law, established a
forest reserve for the simple reason that it was issued not on the basis of
Chapter XII, Title V of Act No. 2874 nor on the basis of Section 1826 of Act
2711 (the Revised Administrative Code which took effect on June 15, 1939), but
on the basis of Section 8 of Act 2874 which empowers the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Governor</span>-General only to reclassify
lands of the public domain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
confirmation, Proclamation No. 369 does not even use the word "reserve"
or "forest reserve" (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 24; Petition, p. 17).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8 of Act No. 2874, the former Public Land Act, the basis
of Proclamation No. 369, provides -</p>

<blockquote>"Section 8. Only those lands <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">shall be </span>declared open to disposition or concession which have been
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">officially </span>delimited and
classified and, when practicable, surveyed, and which have not been reserved
for public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">or quasi-public uses, nor
appropriated by the Governor, nor in any manner become private property, not
those </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">which a private right authorized and
recognized by this Act or any other valid law may be claimed, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">which, having been reserved or appropriated, have ceased to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the Governor-General may, for
reasons of public interest, declare lands of the public domain open to
disposition before the same have had their boundaries established or been
surveyed, or may, for the same reasons, suspend their concession or disposition
by proclamation duly published or by Act of Legislature." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 745-746).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the above-quoted provision, the Governor?General was
specifically empowered not only to declare lands of public domain open to
disposition but also to suspend their concession or disposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, withdrawal of a certain area to
establish a forest reserve is, without question, within the power of the
Governor-General.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The then
Governor-General Dwight F. Davis, in issuing Proclamation No. 369, withdrew
from settlement or disposition the tracts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of
</span>land described therein to establish a forest reserve.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intention can be gleaned from the last
paragraph of Proclamation No. 369, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"From this <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">reserve
shall be considered automatically excluded </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">all </span>areas which had already been certified and which in the
future may be proclaimed as classified and certified by the Director of
Forestry as non-forest lands and approved by the Secretary of Agriculture and
Natural Resources." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 768).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, then President Carlos P. Garcia confirmed that Proclamation
No. 369 did establish a forest reserve when he issued an May 8, 1959
Proclamation No. 583 entitled "Excluding From the Operation of
Proclamation No. 369, Dated February 27, 1931, <u>Which</u> <u>Established</u> <u>The</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Agusan-Davao-Surigao</u></span> <u>Forest</u> <u>Reserve</u>,
Certain Parcels of Land Embraced Therein, And Declaring the Same Open to
Disposition Under the Provisions of the Mining Act." (Underscoring
supplied).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This proclamation was
concurred in by the Congress of the Philippines <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on May </span>21, 1959 through Concurrent
Resolution No. 17 entitled "Concurrent Resolution Concurring in
Proclamation Numbered Five Hundred Eighty-Three of the President of the
Philippines, Dated May Eight, Nineteen Hundred Fifty Nine, Excluding From the
Operation of <u>Proclamation</u> <u>Numbered</u> <u>Three</u> <u>Hundred</u> <u>Sixty-Nine</u>,
<u>which</u> <u>Established</u> <u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Agusan-Davao-Surigao</u></span>
<u>Forest</u> <u>Reserve</u>, Certain Parcels of Land Embraced Therein, and
Declaring the Same Open to Disposition Under the Provisions of the Mining
Act." (Underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it should be stated that the findings of
government agencies with respect to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">construction
</span>of statutes the implementation of which has been reposed in them, are
controlling on the Court (<span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span> Mining Company
v. Office of the President, 163 SCRA 350 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The disputed areas, being clearly within a forest reserve, are
not open to mining location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sections 8
and 13 of P.D. No. 463, as amended by P.D. No. 1385, provide:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 8. Prospecting, Exploration and Exploitation of Minerals
in Reserved Lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prospecting,
exploration and exploitation of minerals in reserved lands other than mineral
reservations may be undertaken <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>the
proper Government agencies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event
that said agencies cannot undertake <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the
prospecting, exploration and exploitation of mineral in reserved lands,
qualified persons may be permitted to undertake such prospecting, exploration
and exploitation in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by
the Secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to exploit the
minerals found therein shall be awarded by the President under such terms and
conditions as recommended by the Director and approved by the Secretary: <u>Provided</u>,
That the party who undertook prospecting, exploration and exploitation of said
area shall be given priority.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a
special permit may be issued by the Director to the exploration <span class="SpellE">permittee</span> to extract, remove and dispose of minerals in
limited quantities as verified by the Bureau of Mines."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">13. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Areas Closed to Mining Location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No prospecting and exploration shall be

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to P.D. No. 463, as amended, one can acquire mining
rights within forest reserves by initially applying for a permit to prospect
with the Bureau of Forest and Development (BFD) and subsequently for a permit
to explore with the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences (BMGS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such procedural requisites were complied with
and undertaken by MARCOPPER after it had ascertained that its mining claims
were found to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">within </span>the <span class="SpellE">Agusan-Davao-Surigao</span> Forest Reserve.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the mining claims and <span class="SpellE">SSMPs</span> of APEX being located within said forest reserve are
in violation of the law and therefore result in a failure to validly acquire
mining rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, invariable is the rule that in reviewing administrative
decisions of the Executive Branch of the government, the finding of fact made
there in must be respected, as long as they are supported by substantial
evidence, even if not overwhelming or preponderant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not for the reviewing court to weigh
the conflicting ev<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">i</span>dence,
determine the credibility of the witnesses, or otherwise substitute its own
judgment for that of the administrative agency on the sufficiency <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The administrative decision in matters within
the executive jurisdiction can only be set aside on proof of gross abuse of
discretion, fraud or error of law (Assistant Executive Secretary for Legal
Affairs of the Office of the President v. Court of Appeals, 169 SCRA 27
[1989]).</p>
