This is a complaint for gross misconduct filed in 1978 by Pedro Aggalut 
against lawyer Mariano T. Bagasao who was admitted to the bar in 1952.
<p>
The spouses Apolinario Aggalut and Juliana Lodovico were the owners of 
Lot No. 636 located at Barrio Tuao, North District No. 6, Bagabag, Nueva
 Ecija, as shown in Original Certificate of Title No. 4564 issued in 
1937.  The lot, which has an area of 2,357 square meters, was sold in 
1938 in a private instrument to Jeremias Dulay who immediately took 
possession thereof.  Jeremias was succeeded by his son, Jesus.
</p><p>
On October 10, 1972, Juanita (sister of Apolinario) and Pedro, both 
surnamed Aggalut, filed a petition in court through lawyer Bagasao, for 
the issuance of owners' duplicates of titles, allegedly destroyed during
 the war, one of which was OCT No. 4564 for Lot No. 636.  Lawyer Bagasao
 did not present Pedro as a witness to testify because his testimony 
allegedly would be cumulative.  The court granted the petition.
</p><p>
In the meantime, Pedro Aggalut became the caretaker of Bagasao's cattle 
ranch.  On August 31, 1976, lawyer Bagasao (provincial assessor), on the
 pretext of working for the transfer of the title of Lot No. 636 to 
Pedro, required him and his wife to sign a document in English.  The 
document dated August 31, 1976 turned out to be a "Deed of Confirmation 
of Sale with Absolute Quitclaim" in favor of Juanita Gonong, Bagasao's 
wife, to whom Pedro's parents allegedly sold the land in a private 
instrument for P500 "duly paid" to them and Pedro.
</p><p>
Gonong supposedly took possession of the land after she bought it from 
Pedro's parents.  The private writing was not quoted in the deed of 
confirmation.  Pedro said that he gave Bagasao the tax receipt and fifty
 pesos for the registration of the deed.  He did not state that he gave 
the owner's duplicate of the title.
</p><p>
Pedro denied that he appeared before Municipal Judge Floramante G. 
Tupasi who notarized the deed of confirmation.  He had not seen the face
 of Judge Tupasi.  The deed did not name Bagasao as the husband of the 
transferee, Juanita Gonong.  The deed was registered.  The new title 
issued to Gonong described her as "married" but her husband's name was 
not specified.
</p><p>
Bagasao and his wife mortgaged Lot 636 and another lot to the Development Bank of the Philippines on <em>February 22, 1977</em> as security for a loan of P18,000.
</p><p>
What makes the case perplexing or bewildering is that even before that mortgage, or on <em>December 6, 1976</em>
 (that was more than three months after the deed of confirmation), 
Juanita Gonong executed in favor of Aggalut a "Deed of Reconveyance 
&amp; Resale Over Registered Land".  Gonong stated in that deed that the
 transfer to her of the land had to be rescinded because of the adverse 
claim of Dulay.
</p><p>
The rescission or reconveyance was allegedly in consideration of the 
return of the P500 paid by Gonong to Aggalut but, before the return of 
that amount, Gonong should "clear" the land of its mortgage obligation 
to the DBP.
</p><p>
Fiscal Justino A. R. Vigilia, the investigator, observed that the said 
deed of reconveyance was "unknown" to Aggalut and was not delivered to 
him.  The adverse claim of Dulay, like the DBP mortgage, was annotated 
on Gonong's title on <em>August 16, 1977</em> or very much later than 
Gonong's deed of reconveyance.  Note further that the deed of 
reconveyance was disclosed by lawyer Bagasao in his answer to the 
complaint dated <em>October 10, 1978</em> by means of these allegations:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That even the ownership of the land (Lot 636) which was lawfully 
conveyed to the respondent's wife, had long remained to belong to the 
complainant because when adverse claims of ownership were interposed 
over the sale in favor of respondent's wife, there was no other recourse
 for respondent's wife but to rescind the sale by way of reconveyance of
 the property to said complainant.  Attached hereto and marked as Annex A
 is the deed of resale and reconveyance executed almost two years ago at
 Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya and in favor of this complainant, and which 
document will clearly show the malice and evil motives of said 
complainant in filing the charges against the herein respondent." (sic) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To support his answer, Bagasao presented the affidavits of Bruno 
Organista and Saturnino Galapon.  Organista averred that he was 
requested by Aggalut to look for a buyer of Lot No. 636.  Apparently, 
the interested buyer was Juanita Gonong.  Because the title was still in
 the name of Aggalut's parents, it was arranged that Aggalut would 
execute a document of confirmation of sale in favor of Gonong.  Galapon 
averred that he was the one who prepared the deed of confirmation and 
that Aggalut appeared before the municipal judge to acknowledge it.
</p><p>
In Civil Case No. 2585 of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Vizcaya, 
Dulay sued the Bagasao spouses for the cancellation of their title to 
Lot No. 636.  The case was settled amicably between Dulay and the 
Bagasao spouses.  The settlement was in favor of Dulay.  <em>The title of Gonong was cancelled</em>.  A new title was issued to Dulay.  <em>Aggalut executed a quitclaim of his supposed rights to Lot No. 636</em>.
</p><p>
Aggalut, assisted by Dulay's counsel, <em>withdrew his herein complaint against Bagasao</em>.
  Fiscal Vigilia noted that Aggalut did not come to this Court with 
clean hands.  He should have known that he had no rights to Lot No. 636.
  The logical complainant was Dulay.
</p><p>
Notwithstanding that withdrawal, Bagasao's obvious maneuvers and 
machinations to acquire that lot cannot be tolerated and glossed over 
and cannot escape censure.
</p><p>
He is severely reprimanded for his unethical manipulations regarding Lot
 No. 636.  A copy of this decision should be attached to his file in the
 Bar Confidant's office.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro</em>, and <em>Escolin</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar,</em> J.,<em> (Chairman), </em>respondent should be disbarred for falsification of a public document and taking undue advantage of an ignorant man.
