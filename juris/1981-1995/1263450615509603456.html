<p class="BODY">This automatic review pertains to <span class="SpellE">PIZARRAS</span>
alone as the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Acojido</span>,
who was also sen­tenced to death in the same decision, was dismissed on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1976</st1:date> in view of his
demise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records also show that Romeo
<span class="SpellE">Quijano</span> was never apprehended and has remained at
large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>
Obispo was tried sepa­rately as he was arrested later than <span class="SpellE">PIZARRAS</span>,
but sentence was suspended due to his minority and because of his drug
addiction, he was ordered committed to <span style="">DARE
</span>Foundation for rehabilitation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, said Obispo escaped from DARE Foundation and has since evaded
pro­nouncement of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense does not dispute that ASUNCION <span class="SpellE">Sigua</span>
was a victim of the crime of Robbery with Rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It maintains, however, that the accused did not take part in the
commission thereof, and that the testimonies of prosecution witnesses,
particularly <st1:city><st1:place>ASUNCION</st1:place></st1:city> and the
passerby Ernesto Villanueva, relied upon by the trial Court, are full of
inconsistencies and improbabilities that they should not have been given full
faith and credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall examine those testimonies as well as those of the
defense witnesses.</p>

four men (two of <span style="">whom </span>she

the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Police Depart­ment as <span class="SpellE">PIZARRAS</span> and <span class="SpellE">Acojido</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From a distance of about 2 meters, the men

under the truck where she was raped successively by the second and third
man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She identified the third man as <span class="SpellE">PIZARRAS</span> </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">he was the one whose left arm encircled her
neck </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">whose right hand held </span>a <span style="">knife against her while being raped by the
first two men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she was being
ravished by the three men, <span class="SpellE">Acojido</span> was holding her
legs apart and was about to take his turn in assaulting her when a person, (who
turned out </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be Ernesto Villanueva) passed by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The passerby helped in taking her to the </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasay</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span>City Police <span style="">Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">ASUNCION</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> further stated that she did not fight off
the four attackers as they </span><span style="">were

she met the four men but that she recognized them be­cause </span><span style="">she kept on staring at them.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As the law now stands,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Contrary to the defense

the doctrine in the <span class="SpellE">Obtinalia</span> case, which gave the rationale
for the imposition of the graver penalty, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> if a rape alone, when committed
by two or more persons, is penalized with death, it would be highly illogical
and irrational to hold that when such rape is committed with the addition of a robbery,
the offense should only be punishable with life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
prescribed by Article 294(2) of the Revised Penal Code, for robbery with rape,
must be understood as limited to cases where there is a single rapist, and that
in those cases where the rape on occasion of the robbery is committed by two or
more persons, the death penalty provided by Republic Act No. 4111 must
apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the more so because the crime
was committed with the aggravating circumstances of its being perpetrated in
the dwelling of the complainant victims, and with attendant ignominy, since the
rapes were done in the presence of the woman's husband (p. 661)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">At
this juncture, it should be pointed out that if the crime were committed after
August 15, 1975, the issue would be moot as Article 294(2) was amended by Presi­dential
Decree No. 767 specifically providing that when the robbery accompanied by rape
is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by two or more persons the
penalty shall be </span><i style=""><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">to death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As earlier stated, the
commission of the crime herein was attended by the aggravating circumstance of
"in band" without any mitigating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rape was qualified by the use of deadly
weapons and was committed </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">four </span><span style="">persons, </span><span style="">thereby
