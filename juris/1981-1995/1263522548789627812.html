This is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>filed by petitioner
 People of the Philippines to set aside the decision of the then Court 
of Appeals, now Intermediate Appellate court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  which affirmed the order issued by the then City Court of Lucena, 
Branch II, denying the prosecution's motion for the exclusion of Miguel 
Roncesvalles (co-accused of the private respondents herein named) from 
the information in Criminal Case No. 0399 so that he may testify 
there­in as a state witness.
<p>
The amended information for violation of Section 22 of Republic Act No. 
720, as amended, charged that Miguel Roncesvalles, together with herein 
private respondents Jose V. Perez, Amadea Consul Perez, Cipriano Ladines
 and Flavia C. Valdenor, "with intent to deceive, conspiring, 
confederating and mutually helping one another, did then and there 
wilfully, unlawfully and illegally make false statements and 
misrepresentation of material facts in the application for agricultural 
loan signed by FLAVIA C. VALDENOR and in the other supporting papers, 
calculated to produce semblance of compliance with the legal 
requirements, making it appear that accused FLAVIA C. VALDENOR is an 
eligible borrower, which misrepresentation or false statements of facts 
were considered as the credit factors in the approval and the granting 
of the loan to accused FLAVIA C. VALDENOR in the amount of P30,000.00, 
by the Rural Bank of Lucena, Inc., x x x."
</p><p>
All the accused pleaded not guilty when arraigned.  After the 
prosecution had already presented seven witnesses, the state prosecutors
 filed a motion with the court, asking that accused Roncesvalles be 
discharged from the information in order that he may be used as a state 
witness against his co-defendants, alleging that Roncesvalles had not at
 any time been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude; that 
he did not appear to be the most guilty; that there was absolute 
necessity for his testimony; that there was no other direct evidence 
available for the proper prosecution of the offense committed and that 
his testimony could be substan­tially corroborated in its material 
points.  The motion was set for hearing and after the parties were 
heard, the trial court, issued the questioned order denying the motion 
on the ground that, "x x x Miguel Roncesvalles cannot be said to be the <em>least guilty.</em>
  He would be a principal by direct participation, or a co-principal if 
he acted upon instruction of another as the prosecution alleges," and 
that, "the prosecu­tion having presented all its witnesses, the Court, 
after going over their testimony, <em>cannot see</em> how Roncesvalles' testimony, if ever he is discharged, would be <em>corroborated</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
Reconsideration having been denied by the trial court, the prosecution filed a petition for <em>certiorari </em>with
 respondent appellate court praying for the annulment and setting aside 
of the trial court's questioned orders.  Respondent court sustained the 
trial court's ruling in its decision, subject of the petition at bar and
 denied reconsideration thereof.
</p><p>
Hence, the People's petition, which complains that "the respondent court
 acted with grave abuse of discretion or in excess of its jurisdiction 
in sustaining the Order dated September 15, 1978 issued by the City 
Court of Lucena and in holding that the petitioner failed to show that 
there is ab­solute necessity for the testimony of Miguel Roncesvalles 
whose discharge is requested."
</p><p>
The Court finds merit in this petition and dispenses with the filing of 
memoranda or briefs in the light of the facts and pleadings of record.
</p><p>
Section 9, Rule 119 of the Rules of Court prescribes the conditions in 
order that one or several accused may be used as witnesses against their
 co-accused, to wit:  "(a) there is absolute necessity for the testimony
 of the defendant whose discharge is requested; (b) there is no other 
direct evidence available for the proper prosecution of the offense 
committed, except the testimony of said defendant; (c) the testimony of 
said defendant can be substantially corroborated in its material points;
 (d) said defendant does not appear to be the most guilty; and (e) said 
defendant has not at any time been convicted of any offense involving 
moral turpitude."
</p><p>
While it is true that the court has the exclusive responsibility to see that the conditions prescribed by the rule exists,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  this grant of discretion is not a grant of arbitrary discretion, but 
rather a sound judicial discretion to be exercised with due regard to 
the proper and correct administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The trial court manifestly erred in denying the prosecution's motion to 
discharge accused Roncesvalles on the ground that he "cannot be said to 
be the least guilty." All that the law requires, in order to discharge 
an accused and to use him as a state witness is that the defendant whose
 exclusion is requested does not appear to be the most guilty, not 
necessarily that he is the least guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The trial court's order itself shows that Roncesvalles does not appear
 to be the most guilty since it acknowledged that "he would be a 
principal by direct participation or a co-principal if he acted upon 
instruction of another as the prosecution alleges."
</p><p>
The Rules do not disqualify an accused sought to be discharged as 
witness for the state merely on the ground that he has committed a 
falsification himself, or that he had actually committed the crime 
charged.  The Rules say that it is necessary that the "said defendant 
does not appear to be the most guilty," from which the conclusion 
follows that the guilt of an accused of the crime charged is no reason 
why he may not be excluded as witness for the State.  As a matter of 
fact, the candid admission of an accused, of his participation in a 
crime, is a guaranty that if he will testify in court he will testify 
truthfully; so that even if an accused actually participated in the 
offense charged in the information, he may still be made a witness.  
Individuals who are candid enough to admit their guilt are expected to 
testi­fy truthfully and it is from that circumstance that all the facts 
involved shall be expected to be truthfully disclosed by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
The ground underlying the rule is not to let a crime that has been 
committed go unpunished; so an accused who is not the most guilty is 
allowed to testify against the most guilty in order to achieve the 
greater purpose of securing the conviction of the more or most guilty 
and the greatest number among the accused permitted to be convicted for 
the offense they have committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  Experience, under English and American procedural methods, has shown 
that without the aid of informers testifying against their 
co-participants in crime, many guilty parties would escape, where the 
facts which would sustain a conviction are known to the guilty parties 
themselves alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
Respondent appellate court itself sustained the People's contention on 
this score, simply stating that "respondent Court erred when it ruled 
that it could not grant the motion for the discharge of Roncesvalles 
because it does not appear that he is the least guilty of the accused.  
What Section 9, Rule 119 requires as one of the conditions for the 
discharge of one of the accused to testify as a witness for the 
Govern­ment is that said 'defendant does not appear to be the most 
guilty.'"
</p><p>
But respondent appellate court nevertheless sustained the questioned 
orders "since the petition failed to show that there was absolute 
necessity for the testimony of Roncesvalles".  The trial court had 
denied discharge on the ground that "the prosecution having presented 
all its witnesses, the Court, after going over their testimony, can not 
see how Roncesvalles testimony, if ever he is discharged, would be 
corroborated." This conjecture of the trial court has no sound basis, as
 is readily shown by respondent appellate court's contrary evaluation 
that "the most that petitioner could say was that the testimony of 
Roncesvalles would be corroborative of the testimony of the witnesses 
already presented by the Government as well as the <em>document­ary evidence</em>
 presented during the hearing, among them, the Rural Bank Examiner and 
NBI agents." Sufficient corroborative evidence exists of record.
</p><p>
The Court therefore overrules respondent court's finding that there is 
no absolute necessity for the testimony of Roncesvalles.  A careful 
examination of the records of the case supports the prosecution's stand 
to discharge Roncesval­les in order that he may testify for the 
government.  The testimony of Roncesvalles is absolutely necessary to 
prove conspiracy among the accused who are charged of conspiring and 
confederating with each other in defrauding the Lucena Rural Bank in the
 amount of P30,000.00 under the pretext of an agricultural loan granted 
to accused Flavia N. Valdenor.  Roncesvalles was the Assistant Chief 
Inspector of the Lucena Rural Bank and he was the one who signed the 
investigation report which contained false information as to the credit 
standing of accused Flavia Valdenor.  Nobody is in a better position to 
testify and prove the existence of conspiracy than accused Roncesvalles,
 because he is an officer of the bank.  There is ample basis for the 
Solicitor General's submittal that "considering the foregoing 
circumstances and inasmuch as the other accused cannot be compelled to 
testify, certain facts necessary for the conviction of the accused would
 not be revealed unless accused Roncesvalles is allowed to testify for 
the State"; "unless accused Roncesvalles is allowed to testify for the 
government, there is no other dir­ect evidence available for the proper 
prosecution of the offense charged, i.e., the role or participation of 
his co-accused in the preparation and accomplishment of the falsified 
loan application and its supporting papers.  The testi­mony of accused 
Roncesvalles will prove conspiracy among the perpetrators of the crime 
charged"; and "unless this petition is given due course and granted, the
 accused in Criminal Case No. 0399 may be acquitted and the State 
irretrievably prejudiced.  Because of the Rule on double jeopardy, the 
State has no other remedy except the instant petition."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
It is noteworthy that these assertions appear to be based on solid 
ground for the prosecutors presented their motion for discharge of 
Roncesvalles as a state witness only after they had presented seven 
witnesses and could then show the absolute necessity for his testimony 
in consonance with what was to be held by the Court in <em>Flores vs. Sandiganbayan </em>that
 the trial court should act on said discharge motion when the 
prosecution has presented all its other evidence and it could then 
"fully determine whether the requisites prescribed in Section 9, Rule 
119 of the New Rules of Court, are fully complied with."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
A trial judge cannot be expected or required to inform himself with 
absolute certainty at the very outset of the trial as to everything 
which may be developed in the course of the trial in regard to the 
guilty participation of the accused in the commission of the crime 
charged in the com­plaint.  If that were practicable or possible, there 
would be little need for the formality of a trial.  In coming to his 
conclusion as to the 'necessity for the testimony of the accused whose 
discharge is requested'; as to the 'availability or non-availability of 
other direct or corroborative evidence'; as to which of the accused is 
the 'most guilty'; and the like, the judge must rely in a large part 
upon the suggestions and information furnished by the state 
prosecu­tors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, respondent appellate court's decision affirming the trial 
court's questioned orders denying the discharge of Miguel Roncesvalles 
as a state witness is hereby SET ASIDE.  As prayed for, the trial court 
is ORDERED to allow the discharge of said accused Miguel Roncesvalles 
from the information before it in Criminal Case No. 0399 so that he may 
testify therein as a state witness.
</p><p>
This decision is immediately executory.
