				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This case is before Us for the review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Quezon, Branch IV, in Criminal Case No. C-351, dated January 3, 1969, the dispositive portion of which reads: <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, the four (4) accused AQUINO ALVAREZ, ENRICO CABATINGAN, JUANITO ALERTA and PABLO MENDOZA are hereby CONVICTED with the crime as charged, because their guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt, and they are hereby punished to death by electrocution, pursuant to Art. 299 in relation with Arts. 248, 6, 48 and 51 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 12 and 18; while the seven (7) other accused, namely: DOMINADOR ALERTA, BONIFACIO ALISON, IDOLES CORO, NASALITO SUBING-SUBING, ROMULO CABATINGAN, GERARDO SANTIAGO and PEDRO GALUPO, considering their lesser degree of participation and their guilt equally proven beyond reasonable doubt, are hereby CONVICTED and to suffer imprisonment for life or <em>cadena perpetua</em>; hereby ordering the eleven (11) accused to indemnify the heirs of SGT. GREGORIO CALNEA and CPL. ALFREDO LLANTINO, the amount of TWELVE THOUSAND (P12,000.00) PESOS for each victim, or a total of TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND (P24,000.00) PESOS, to be divided <em>pro rata</em>&nbsp; among them, but without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; and, to reimburse Juanito Uy the amount of FOUR THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED THIRTY (P4,330.00) PESOS, and the heirs of Sgt. Gregorio Calnea as well as Capt. Plaridel M. Abaya himself the amount of NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY (P980.00) PESOS, or a grand total of FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TEN (P5,310.00) PESOS, in Philippine currency, (representing the cash and articles robbed), with costs <em>de oficio</em>."</p></blockquote> <p>On February 20, 1970, this Court issued a resolution as follows: "The motion of accused-appellants Nasalito Subing-Subing and Dominador Alerta, withdrawing their appeal in this case, is GRANTED."</p> <p>Likewise, on September 22, 1970, this Court issued this resolution: "The motion of appellants Idoles Coro and Gerardo Santiago praying that they be allowed to withdraw their appeal in this case, is GRANTED."</p> <p>And, on April 27, 1972, the case against appellant Bonifacio Alison was dismissed on the ground that on January 26, 1972, he died. "The death of accused-appellant Bonifacio Alison having been established and considering that there is as yet no final judgment in view of the pendency of the appeal, the criminal and civil liability of said accused-appellant Alison was extinguished by his death (Resolution, G.R. No. 30612, April 27, 1972)."</p> <p>Thus, this appeal concerns Juanito Alerta, Enrico Cabatingan, Aquino Alvarez, Pablo Mendoza, Romulo Cabatingan and Pedro Galupo only.</p> <p>Records show that on May 3, 1966, the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Quezon filed an amended information for the crime of robbery in band with double murder and attempted murder against twelve (12) persons, namely: Juanito Alerta, Dominador Alerta, Enrico Cabatingan, Bonifacio Alison, Idoles Coro, Aquino Alvarez, Pablo Mendoza, Nazalito Subing-Subing, Romulo Cabatingan, Gerardo Santiago, Pedro Galupo and Valeriano Jimenez. The last named accused, Valeriano Jimenez, was discharged with his consent from the information, upon motion of the prosecuting fiscal and made a state witness.</p> <p>On March 17, 1966, the abovenamed defendants met together in Burias Island and there planned to rob Juanito Uy, who was known to be wealthy. Valeriano Jimenez was to guide the group to the Uy's residence in San Narciso, Quezon because, being a tenant of the latter, he knew the place.</p> <p>The plan was, Aquino Alvarez, Enrico Cabatingan, Juanito Alerta, and Pablo Mendoza would enter the house of the intended victim, and execute the robbery; and the rest were to form an armed cordon around the premises.</p> <p>The group left in a pump boat of Pablo Mendoza from Burias Island to San Narciso at about 6:00 in the afternoon of March 17, 1966. They reached San Narciso about midnight of the same day. On the way, Enrico Cabatingan distributed the firearms which would be used in the commission of the crime. Upon reaching San Narciso, the group went to the Uy's residence, leaving Pedro Galupo at the wharf to guard the boat.</p> <p>As Valeriano Jimenez was familiar with the place because he had been there several times before, he, together with the group, climbed over the fence and he pointed to them the backdoor of the house through the stairs. They drilled a hole on the door of the kitchen and, thereafter, Juanito Alerta told Jimenez to return to the boat so that he would not be identified.</p> <p>It was about 1:00 in the morning of March 18, 1966 when Juanito Uy was awakened by persons who said: "Gising, gising, PC ito," following which one of the armed men asked him: "PC ka ba?" Uy answered: "Hindi po." The armed men then tied up Uy's hands and he was asked where his guests, the PC men, were sleeping. Threatened and coerced, he pointed the room, which was then lighted with a native gas lamp, of PC Lt. Plaridel Abaya, PC Sgt. Gregorio Calnea and PC Cpl. Alfredo Llantino. Pushing the door open, one of the armed men shouted: "Huwag lalaban, huwag kikilos," and immediately Enrico Cabatingan, Aquino Alvarez, Pablo Mendoza and Juanito Alerta commenced firing. Aquino Alvarez then approached Lt. Abaya's bed and said: "Ito PC rin? Papatayin ko na." Juanito Alerta replied: “Huwag."</p> <p>Lieutenant Abaya's hands, like Juanito Uy's, were hogtied, after which they were taken down the ground floor of the residence where the safe was located. Uy was ordered to open it and then ordered to lie face down on the cement floor. The men got the money and even remarked that the amount was not much.</p> <p>The men brought Uy outside his residence and was ordered to go with them to the wharf. As they ran, Juanito Uy was directed to shout, repeatedly: "I am Juanito, policemen, PC, don’t fight." Upon reaching the wharf and before the men boarded the boat, Juanito was made to lie face down.</p> <p>Upon his return to his residence, Juanito found papers scattered on the floor, one of the PC men already dead and the other hovering between life and death. He discovered that the group had taken P3,500.00 from the safe, his .22 caliber magnum revolver and wallet containing personal papers and some cash.</p> <p>Philippine Constabulary Sgt. Gregorio Calnea and Cpl. Alfredo Llantino died of severe hemorrhage due to multiple gunshot wounds in the chest, abdomen, head and other parts of the body, all of which according to Dr. Ziegfredo Cabungkal and Dr. Hilarion Tan, Jr. were caused by different weapons.</p> <p>Herein appellants were arrested in Masbate in the last week of April 1966. Their extra judicial statements, wherein they admitted their participation in the incident, were taken and sworn to before City Judge Aquilino Villanueva.</p> <p>The defense is alibi, the appellants claiming that on March 17 and 18, 1966 they were in Masbate and therefore had nothing to do with the robbery and death of the two (2) PC soldiers in San Narciso, Quezon; that upon their arrest they were hogtied and maltreated by the PC soldiers who forced them to sign prepared statements; and that the arresting officers were accompanied by Valeriano Jimenez from whom they inquired why he pointed to them and Jimenez answered that he could no longer endure the punishment inflicted upon him by the PC soldiers.</p> <p>After consideration of all the evidence presented and relying on the testimonies of eyewitnesses Juanito Uy, PC Lt. Plaridel Abaya and Valeriano Jimenez, the trial court disregarded the alibi interposed by the appellants and convicted them of the crime charge, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p>"With the foregoing principles as our guidelines, may we register our observation that practically all witnesses for the accused have invoked the defense of alibi and that their affidavits or extra-judicial confessions were allegedly extracted thru maltreatment, so that may we quote the following doctrines: 'Alibi is one of the weakest defenses that can be resorted to by an accused. Either or both of the following reasons were used by the Supreme Court in rejecting the defense of alibi. (1) the place where the accused claimed he was at the time of the commission of the offense was not of such a distance from the place of commission as to make it impossible for him to be at the latter place at or about the time of the commission of the crime; and (2) positive identification of the accused by witnesses.</p> <p>"Illustrating the first is the case of People <em>vs</em>. Secapuri, which held that 'for the defense of alibi to succeed, it should be shown to the satisfaction of a prudent mind that the distance between the places where the accused claimed to be and where the crime was committed is such that it would have been clearly impossible for him to be at the latter at the time of the crime. (G.R. No. 21419, September 29, 1966, et al). In this case the place of origin of the accused is Masbate, an island that is about 4 to 5 hours to traverse up to San Narciso, Quezon by pump-boat of Pablo Mendoza.</p> <p>"An extra-judicial confession made by an accused, shall not be sufficient ground for conviction, unless corroborated by evidence of corpus delicti.</p> <p>"What is meant by 'evidence of corpus delicti?' This phrase was explained by the Supreme Court in the case of People <em>v</em>. Abrera, when it pointed out that 'the rule that an extrajudicial confession to be sufficient must be corroborated by evidence of <em>corpus delicti</em> does not mean that all the elements of the crime must be clearly established by evidence independent of that confession. It only means that there should be some evidence tending to show the commission of the crime apart from the confession. (G.R. No. 18760, September 29, 1966). There is no doubt that the corroborative testimonies of the government witnesses, except for minor details substantiate the facts contained in the affidavits of the accused which are all true.</p> <p align="center">. . .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;. . .</p> <p>"In this case, some of the accused were not only investigated by PC soldiers, but also by Fiscals Jose Veluz Jr., and Celso B. Florido in the Office of the Provincial Fiscal of Quezon, and one by one the affiants were sworn to inside the room of Lucena City Judge Aquilino Villanueva. If they were truly maltreated and forced into signing their statements they had all the opportunity to complain. Besides, they had counsel departe who failed to appear during the investigation although he promised to come. Their silence, therefore, militates against their clamour that they were punished."

(People <em>vs</em>. Garcia, 89 SCRA 440).</p> <p>In the case at bar, the trial court correctly ruled that alibi is a weak defense not only because it is easy to fabricate but also because human memory on dates or days is frail, and unless the day is an extraordinary or unusual one for the witnesses, there is no reasonable assurance of its correctness. (People <em>vs</em>. Dasig, 93 Phil. 618).</p> <p>However, the defense contends, and rightly so, that if at all, Romulo Cabatingan and Pedro Galupo should have not been convicted of the complex crime of robbery in band with double murder and attempted murder because from the testimony of defendant Jimenez, who turned state witness, the plan was only to rob Juanito Uy and the killing of the PC soldiers came about only when Aquino Alvarez, Enrico Cabatingan, Juanito Alerta and Pablo Mendoza entered the room where the victims were sleeping. Otherwise stated, the killing or the assault upon the PC soldiers were not known to the other accused who were left outside to guard the premises and to Pedro Galupo who stayed in the pumpboat. The crime committed by these two appellants Romulo Cabatingan and Pedro Galupo is only robbery in band, attended by the aggravating circumstances of nighttime and evident premeditation, punishable by prision mayor in its medium period.</p> <p>With respect to appellants Aquino Alvarez, Enrico Cabatingan, Juanito Alerta, and Pablo Mendoza who were sentenced to "death by electrocution", for lack of necessary votes, each is hereby sentenced to the next lower penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, as modified in the sense that Aquino Alvarez, Enrico Cabatingan, Juanito Alerta and Pablo Mendoza are each sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and that Romulo Cabatingan and Pedro Galupo are each sentenced to SEVEN (7) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY, as minimum to TEN YEARS of <em>prision mayor</em>, as maximum, the appealed judgment is hereby AFFIRMED in all other respects.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p> <p><em>Teehankee, Acting C.J., Makasiar, Concepcion Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin, Vasquez</em> and <em>Gutierrez, Jr., JJ.,</em> concur.<br><em>Fernando, C.J.,</em> is on official leave.<br><em>Aquino, J.,</em> took no part.</p></div>
