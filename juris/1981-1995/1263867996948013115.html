				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Submitted for adjudication in the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
is the issue of whether or not the execution of a decision in an action for
collection of a sum of money may be nullified on the ground that the real
properties levied upon and sold at public auction are the alleged exclusive
properties of a husband who did not participate in his wife's business
transaction from which said action stemmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> Henson
married Katrina Pineda on <st1:date year="1964" day="6" month="1">January 6,
 1964</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
They have three children but even during the early years of their marriage, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> and Katrina had been most of the time living <span style="">separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>The former stayed in <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> while the latter lived in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the marriage or on <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1971</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
bought a 1,787-square-meter parcel of land in <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for P11,492 from his father,
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> L. Henson<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
with money borrowed from an officemate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His father needed the amount for investments in <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> sometime in June
1972, Katrina entered into an agreement with Anita Chan whereby the latter
consigned to Katrina pieces of jewelry for sale valued at 199,895 <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> dollars or P321,830.95.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
When Katrina failed to return the pieces of jewelry within the 20-day period
agreed upon, Anita Chan demanded payment of their value.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1972</st1:date>,
Katrina issued in favor of Anita Chan a check for P55,000 which, however, was
dishonored for lack of funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
Katrina was charged with <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> before the then Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Branch IV.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
After trial, the lower court rendered a decision dismissing the case on the
ground that Katrina's liability was not criminal but civil in nature as no <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> was committed by the issuance of the check in
payment of a pre-existing obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of said decision, Anita Chan and her husband Ricky Wong
filed against Katrina and her husband <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
Henson, an action for collection of a sum of money also in the same branch of
the aforesaid court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The records of the case show that Atty. Gregorio Albino, Jr. filed an answer
with counterclaim but only in behalf of Katrina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the case was called for pre-trial, Atty.
Albino once again appeared as counsel for Katrina only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that during subsequent
hearings, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Expedito</span> <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>,
who collaborated with Atty. Albino, appeared for the defendants, it is not
shown on record that said counsel also represented <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, a power of attorney which Atty.
Albino produced during the trial, showed that the same was executed solely by
Katrina.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Wongs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered Katrina and <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
Henson to pay the <span class="SpellE">Wongs</span> HK$199,895.00 or P321,830.95
with legal interest from May 27, 1975, the date of filing of the complaint,

<p class="BODY">The public auction sale was first set for <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1977</st1:date> but since said date was
declared a public holiday, Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Emerito</span> <span class="SpellE">Sicat</span> reset the sale to <st1:date year="1977" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On said date, the following properties registered in the name of <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> Henson "married to Katrina Henson" were
sold at public auction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) two parcels
of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title <span style="">Nos. </span>30950 and 30951 with respective areas of 293 and 289 square

and (b) two parcels of land covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
30952 and 30953 with respective areas of 289 and 916 square meters in the
amount of P119,000.00 to Leonardo B. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the inscription on Transfer Certificate of Title No. 30951
of the levy on execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 2224, the property
covered by said title was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed
by the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Porac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
on account of the mortgage loan of P8,000 which <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
and Katrina had obtained from said bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The property was sold by the sheriff to the highest bidder for P57,000
on <st1:date year="1977" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1978</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Santos, who had earlier
bought the same property at public auction on <st1:date year="1977" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1977</st1:date>, redeemed it by paying the sum of
P57,000 plus the legal interest of P6,840.00 or a total amount of P63,840.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">About a month before such redemption or on <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1978</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
filed an action for the annulment of the decision in Civil Case No. 2224 as
well as the writ of execution, levy on execution and the auction sale therein
in the same Court of First Instance.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> alleged that he was "not given his day
in court" because he was not represented by counsel as Attys. Albino and <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> appeared solely for Katrina; that although he did not
file an answer to the complaint he was not declared in default in the case;
that while Atty. Albino received a copy of the decision, he and his wife were
never personally served a copy thereof; that he had nothing to do with the
business transactions of Katrina as he did not authorize her to enter into such
trans­actions; and that the properties levied on execution and sold at public auction
by the sheriff were his capital properties and therefore, as to him, all the
proceedings had in the case were null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1978</st1:date>,
the lower court issued an order restraining the Register of Deeds of Angeles
City from issuing the final bill of sale of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
30950 and 30951 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Santos and
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 30952 and 30953 in favor of Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> until further orders of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On January 22, 1979, upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>, the
court issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the sheriff from
approving the final bill of sale of the land covered by the aforementioned
certificates of title and the Register of Deeds of Angeles City from
registering said certificates of title in the names of Santos and <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> until the final outcome of the case subject to <span class="SpellE">Romarico's</span> posting of a bond in the amount of P321,831.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the lower court<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
rendered a decision holding that <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> was indeed
not given his day in court as he was not represented by counsel nor was he
notified of the hearings therein although he was never declared in
default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noting that the complaint in
Civil Case No. 2224 as well as the testimonial and documentary evidence adduced
at the trial in said case do not show that <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
had anything to do with the transactions between Katrina and Anita Chan, the
court ruled that the judgment in Civil Case No. 2224 "is devoid of legal
or factual basis which is not even supported by a finding of fact or <u>ratio</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>decidendi</u></span> in the body of the decision, and may
be declared null and void x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
pursuant to a doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court to the effect that ‘the
Court of First Instance or a branch thereof, has authority and jurisdiction to
try and decide an action for annulment of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment or order rendered by another court of first instance or of a branch
thereof’ (<span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> vs. Imperial, 55 SCRA 755).”<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On whether or not the properties levied upon and sold at public
auction may be <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>,
the court, finding that there was no basis for holding the conjugal partnership
liable for the personal indebtedness of Katrina, ruled in favor of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in view of the jurisprudence that the interest
of the wife in the conjugal partnership property being inchoate and therefore
merely an expectancy, the same may not be sold or disposed of for value until
after the liquidation and settlement of the community assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

the said court affirmed <b>in</b> <span class="SpellE"><b>toto</b></span> the
decision of the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It added
that as to <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>, the judgment in Civil Case No.
2224 had not attained finality as the decision therein was not served on him
and that he was not represented by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> may not be applied against
him as, not having been served with the decision, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
did not know anything about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, there can be no valid writ of execution
inasmuch as the decision had not become final as far as <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On whether the properties may be levied upon as conjugal
properties, the appellate court ruled in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It noted that the properties are <span class="SpellE">Romarico's</span> exclusive capital having been bought by him with
his own funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But granting that the
proper­ties are conjugal, they cannot answer for Katrina's obligations as the
latter were exclusively hers because they were incurred without the consent of
her husband, they were not for the daily expenses of the family and they did
not redound to the benefit of the family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court underscored the fact that no evidence has been submitted that
the administration of the conjugal partner­ship had been transferred to Katrina
either by <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> or by the court before said obligations
were incurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision
of the appellate court but the same was denied for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1985</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners contend that, inasmuch as the
Henson spouses were duly represented by Atty. Albino as shown by their
affidavit of August 25, 1977 wherein they admitted that they were represented
by said counsel until Atty. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> took over the
actual management and conduct of the case and that Atty. Albino had not
withdrawn as their counsel, the lower court “did not commit an error” in
serving a copy of the decision in Civil Case No. 2224 only on Atty.
Albino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, during the 2-year
period between the filing of the complaint in Civil Case No. 2224 and the
public auction sale on November 11, 1977, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
remained silent thereby making him in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> and
guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further aver that there being sufficient evi­dence
that the auction sale was conducted in accordance with law, the acts of the
sheriffs concerned are presumed to be regular and valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But granting that an irregularity consisting
of the non-notification of <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> attended the
conduct of the auction sale, the rights of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> who were "mere strangers who
participated as the highest bidders" therein, may not be prejudiced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> bought the properties sincerely believing
that the sheriff was regularly performing his duties and no evidence was
presented to the effect that they acted with fraud or that they connived with
the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, should the auction
sale be nullified, petitioners assert that <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
should not be unduly enriched at the expense of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' theory is that <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
Henson was guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and may not now belatedly
assert his rights over the properties because he and Katrina were represented
by counsel in Civil Case No. 2224.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
theory is allegedly founded on the perception that the <span class="SpellE">Hensons</span>
were like any other ordinary couple wherein a spouse knows or should know the
transactions of the other spouse which necessarily must be in interest of the
family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual background of this
case, however, takes it out of said ideal situation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> and Katrina had in fact been
separated when Katrina entered into a business deal with Anita Wong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where that business transaction
eventually resulted in the filing of Civil Case No. 2224, <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
acted, or, as charged by peti­tioners, failed to act, in the belief that he was
not involved in the personal dealings of his estranged wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That belief was buttressed by the fact that
the complaint itself did not mention or implicate him other than as the husband
of Katrina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On whether <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> was also represented by Atty. Albino, Katrina's
counsel, the courts below found that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Atty.
Albino filed an Answer with Counter­claims dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1975</st1:date> solely on behalf of defendant Katrina
Henson.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The salutary statement in that
Answer categorically reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> COMES NOW THE DEFENDANT KATRINA HENSON by and through
undersigned counsel, in answer to plaintiffs' complaint respectfully
alleges:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That Answer was signed by GREGORIO ALBINO, JR., over the
phrase 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT KATRINA HENSON.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Again, when Civil Case No. 2224 was called for pre-trial on <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1975</st1:date>, before then
Presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Ejercito</span>,
it is clearly stated on page 2 of the day’s stenographic notes, under
'APPEARANCES' that Atty. Albino, Jr. appeared as 'COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT KATRINA
HENSON.’ And when the case was called, Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>,
Sr. appeared for the plaintiffs while Atty. Albino categorically appeared ‘FOR
DEFENDANT KATRINA HENSON.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It might be true that in subsequent hearings, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Expedito</span> <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> ‘appeared as
counsel for the defendants’, but the whole trouble is that he never expressly
manifested to the Court that he was likewise actually representing defendant
'ROMARICO HENSON', for it cannot be disputed that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>
only entered his appearance in collaboration with Atty. Albino (see p. 2 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, January 26, 1976, Espinosa), who in turn entered his
initial appearance during the pre-trial, and through the filing of an Answer,
for defendant KATRINA HENSON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact the Power of Attorney which Atty. Albino produced during the
pre-trial was executed solely by defendant KATRINA HENSON.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, as collaborating counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be
considered as duly authorized to formally appear likewise on behalf of
defendant ROMARICO HENSON for whom principal counsel of record Atty. Gregorio
Albino, Jr. never made any formal appearance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On this score, it is not amiss to state that 'A spring cannot rise
higher than its source.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Now, what about that statement in the aforementioned joint
affidavit of the spouses KATRINA HENSON and ROMARICO HENSON, to the effect that
'our first lawyer in said case was Atty. Gregorio Albino, Jr., and sometime
later Atty. <span class="SpellE">Expedito</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span>
took over <span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span style="">x.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"That statement which plaintiff ROMARICO HENSON was made to
sign by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> on August 25, 1977, after the
filing of this case, allegedly for the purpose of dissolving the writ of
execution, as claimed in paragraph XIV of the complaint herein, and is satisfac­torily
explained by both plaintiff herein and his wife, while on cross-examination by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Sr., and We quote:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
the summons directed your filing of your Answer for both of you, your wife and
your good self?</blockquote>

<blockquote>'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir but <span style="">may </span>I add, I received the
summons but I did not file an answer because my wife took a lawyer and that
lawyer I think will protect her interest and my interest being so I did not
have nothing to do in the transaction which is attached to the complaint.'
(TSN, Jan. 14, 1980, pp. 52-53).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That plaintiff never appeared in Civil Case No. 2224, nor was
he therein represented by counsel was impliedly admitted by defendants' counsel
of records thru a question he propounded on cross, and the answer given by
Katrina Pineda, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
<span style="">about your husband, do you remember if </span>he
physically appeared in that Civil Case<span style="">
No. 2224, will you tell us if he was </span>represented by counsel as a party
defendant?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">'A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir, he did not appear.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
are husband and wife, please tell us the <span style="">reason
why you have your own counsel in that case whereas <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>
Henson did not appear nor a counsel did not appear in that pro­ceedings?' (TSN,
Feb. 25, 1980, pp. 6-7).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</span>x<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">‘A.
<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because that case is my exclusive and </span>personal
case, he has nothing to do with that, sir.’ (TSN, Feb. 25, 1980, p. 9)." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 17-20)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Hence, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
may not be charged against <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> because, aside
from the fact that he had no knowledge of the transactions of his estranged
wife, he was also not afforded an opportunity to defend himself in Civil Case
No. 2224.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or even finality of decision to speak
of with respect to <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> since the decision in
Civil Case No. 2224 is null and void for having been rendered without
jurisdiction for failure to observe the notice requirements prescribed by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Failure to notify <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> may not be attributed to
the fact that the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 2224 acted on the presumption
that the <span class="SpellE">Hensons</span> <span style="">were </span>still happily married because the complaint itself shows
that they did not consider <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> as a party to the
transaction which Katrina undertook with Anita Wong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all likelihood, the plaintiffs merely <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> as a nominal
party in the <span style="">case </span>pursuant to
the provisions of Rule 3, Section 4 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the writ of execution cannot be issued against <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> as he has not yet had his day in court<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and, necessarily, the public auction sale is null and void.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the power of the court in the execution of judgments extends only
over properties unquestionably belonging to the judgment debtor.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of ownership of the properties involved, however,
the Court disagrees with the appellate court that the said properties are
exclusively owned by <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been acquired during the marriage,
they are still presumed to belong to the conjugal partnership<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
even though <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> and Katrina had been living
separately.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption of the conjugal nature of the properties subsists
in the absence of clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence to overcome said
presumption or to prove that the properties are exclusively owned by <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
While there is proof that <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> acquired the
properties with money he had borrowed from an officemate, it is unclear where
he obtained the money to repay the loan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he paid it out of his salaries, then the money is part of the
conjugal assets<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
and not exclusively his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof on this
matter is of paramount importance considering that in the determination of the
nature of a property acquired <span style="">by </span>a
person during <span class="SpellE">coverture</span>, the controlling factor is
the source of<span style=""> </span>the money utilized
in the purchase.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conjugal nature of the properties notwithstanding, Katrina's
indebtedness may not be paid for with them her obligation not having been shown
by the petitioners to be one of the charges against the conjugal partnership.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In addition to the fact that her rights over the properties are merely inchoate
prior to the liquidation of the conjugal partnership, the consent of her
husband and her authority to incur such indebted­ness had not been alleged in
the complaint and proven at the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, under the Civil Code (before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the Family Code on August 3, 1988), a wife may bind the conjugal partnership
only when she purchases things necessary for the support of the family or when
she borrows money for the purpose of purchasing things necessary for the
support of the family if the husband fails to deliver the proper sum;<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
when the administration of the conjugal partnership is transferred to the wife
by the courts<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
or by the husband,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
and when the wife gives moderate donations for charity.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Having failed to establish that any of these circumstances occurred, the <span class="SpellE">Wongs</span> may not bind the conjugal assets to answer for
Katrina's per­sonal obligation to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contention that the rights of <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Joson</span> as innocent buyers at the public auction
sale may not be prejudiced, is, to a certain extent, valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, in the absence of proof that
irregularities attended the sale, the same must be presumed to have been
conducted in accordance with law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is, however, a peculiar factual circumstance that goes against the grain of
that general presumption - the properties levied upon and sold at the public
auction do not exclusively belong to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the guiding jurisprudence is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule in execution sales is that an execution creditor
acquires no higher or better right than what the execution debtor has in the
property levied upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser of
property on sale under execution and levy takes as assignee only, as the
judicial seller possesses no title other than that which would pass by an
assignment by the owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘An execution
purchaser <span style="">generally acquires such
estate or interest as was vested in the execution debtor at the time of the
seizure on execution, and only such interest, taking merely a quit-claim of the
execution debtor's title, without warranty on the part of either the execution
officer or of the parties, whether the property is realty or personality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule prevails even if a larger interest
in the property was intended to be sold.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, if the judgment debtor had no interest in the property, the
execution purchaser acquires no interest therein.’" (Pacheco vs. Court of
Appeals, L-48689, August 31, 1987, 153 SCRA 382, 388-389 quoting <span class="SpellE">Laureano</span> vs. Stevenson, 45 Phil. 252; <span class="SpellE">Cabuhat</span>

18 Cal. 436 and 21 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., 140-141.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Underscoring supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying this jurisprudence, execution purchasers <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>

judgment debtor Katrina's <b>inchoate</b> proprietary rights over the
properties sold at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
all, a person can sell only what he owns or is authorized to sell and the buyer

transfer.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
But, inasmuch as the decision in Civil Case No. 2224 is void only as far as <span class="SpellE">Romarico</span> and the conjugal proper­ties are concerned, the
