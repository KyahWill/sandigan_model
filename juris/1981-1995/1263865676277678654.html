<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts that gave rise to this petition are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>May 26, 1983,
petitioner Philippine Banking Corporation filed a complaint against the private
respondents for a sum of money with prayer for preliminary attachment,
predicated allegedly on the latter's refusal and failure to pay the stipulated
installments as provided for in the promissory note (Nos. 16-10418 and
16-10539) evidencing an outstanding obligation of P3<span class="GramE">,290,000.00</span>
borrowed by the private respondent from the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was guaranteed <span style="">by a c</span>ontinuing Surety Agreement whereby the private
respondents-spouses acted as surety for the above-mentioned loans, binding
themselves jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with the principal,
the <span class="SpellE">Pennel</span> Commercial Co., Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 4058
of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila, <span class="GramE">Branch</span> 13, presided over by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1983, finding the verified complaint to be sufficient
in form and substance and considering that the petitioner is willing to put up
an attachment bond in the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,094,587.74</span>
which is petitioner's principal claim,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>respondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> issued an Order:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“xxx let a writ of preliminary attachment be
issued against the properties of defendants, not exempt from execution xxx”
(Annex F, p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1983</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed an attachment bond in the aforesaid amount so that on <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1983</st1:date>, summonses were issued
to the defendants, now private respondents, which were received by the latter
on June 29, 1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of the
preliminary attachment issued on <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1983</st1:date>, the real and personal properties of private respondents
were attached and the request for the corresponding annotation on their titles
was served upon the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1983</st1:date>, Notices of Levy on
Execution /Attachment dated <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="6">June 29,
 1983</st1:date> were served upon the Registrars of the Bureau of Land
Transportation of San Juan &amp; <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Agencies,
requiring them to record in their respective books the motor vehicles mentioned
in the name of the said private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Deputy Sheriff filed his Report dated <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1983</st1:date> stating that on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1983</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1983</st1:date>, levy was made on the real and personal
properties of the defendants and the summons with copy of the complaint and the
Writ of Attachment were served personally upon them at their given address thru
their Secretary Y. V. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1983</st1:date>,
the private respondents filed a Motion for Extension of Time to File
Answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1983</st1:date>, they (private respondents) filed a Motion
to Discharge Attachment alleging that the said writ was issued without basis
which is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On July 21, 1983, again private respondents filed a Motion for Another
Extension of Time within which to file Answer but on July 27, 1983, instead of
filing an answer as prayed for in their previous motions, filed a Motion to Dismiss
on the ground that the complaint states no cause of action which motion
petitioner received on July 20, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1983</st1:date>,
petitioner filed an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss with a Motion to
Declare Defendants in Default.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1983</st1:date>,
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> issued an Order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion to Declare
Defendants in Default incorporated in the Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss
is denied for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Motion to Dismiss
is hereby granted and this case, ordered dismissed without pronouncement as to
costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
Motion to Discharge Attachment filed by defendants is hereby granted, and the
order of attachment is set aside and the Writ of Attachment issued by this
Court on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1983</st1:date>,
discharged and declared of no further force and effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sheriff is ordered to return to the
plaintiff all the properties levied by him in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Notice of Levy of Attachment issued by the
Sheriff to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> is also
recalled and the said Register of Deeds is hereby ordered to cancel the notice
of levy on attachment on the real properties of <span style="">defendant </span>as <span style="">contained
in the Notice of Levy dated </span><st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="">." (p. 103, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A certified <span style="">true </span>copy
of the said Order was received by petitioner on <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1983</st1:date>, the petitioner filed an Urgent Motion to Admit Amended
Complaint together with a copy of the Amended Complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by the private respondents
on <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner claims that its Motion to Admit
Amended Complaint has not yet been resolved by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, petitioner filed a Motion to Reconsider the <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1983</st1:date> Order but the same
was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner
went to the Court of Appeals on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> (AC-GR SP No.
01919) <span class="SpellE">chaIlenging</span> the validity of the August 12,
1983 Order dismissing the complaint and discharging the writ of attachment as
well as the September 29, 1983 Order denying the Motion for Reconsideration,
pointing out that the same were issued with grave or serious abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition ruling in part as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We resolved to deny due course to the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the facts, it is clear that the proper remedy available
to the herein petitioner is ordinary appeal to this Court and not by way of the
present petition for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
challenged Order of </span><st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8"><span style="">August 12, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="">, sustaining the motion to dismiss filed by
the herein private respondents on the ground of lack of cause of action is a
final disposition of the case insofar as the respondent Court is
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there is the remedy of
appeal, this bars the filin</span><span style="">g</span><span style=""> of any petition for <i>certiorari</i> for
the reason that one of the requisites for said remedy is that there is no ap</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">eal,
nor any adequate and speedy remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sec. 1, Rule
65, Rules of Court; Silvestre v. Torres, 57 Phil. 885).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span><span style="">Moreover, we find that respondent Judge did
not commit a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the com</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">laint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the disputed order, the respondent Judge
explained his reasons for dismissing the complaint, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'On the<span style=""> </span>Motion to
Dismiss, the ground relied upon the defendants is that the complaint states no
cause of action considering that Annex C and, the promissory notes sued upon, <span style="">have due dates of December 31, 1985, Annex C
and December 30, 1984, Annex D.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
facts were not stated in the complaint, and neither was it alleged that said
notes </span>have <span style="">become due and
payable by reason of defendants’ default in the payment of several installments
due on the notes, which fact was only mentioned in the opposition to the motion
to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'It </span>could not, therefore,
be true that defendants have failed and refused and still refuse and fail
without justifiable cause to pay<span style=""> </span>their
obligation despite repeated demands from the plaintiff, because mere demand on
defendants for the <span style="">payment of
obligations that are not yet due does not constitute a cause of action, there
being </span>no <span style="">showing on the face of
the complaint that the obligations were to be paid in installments which would
make the acceleration clause on Annex D, the Continuing Surety Agreement, come
into play in order to make the whole obligation due and payable even before
their due dates as reflected in the promissory notes, Annexes C and D.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, it cannot be gainfully said therefore
that the exercise of discretion or judgment by the respondent Judge was
capricious or whimsical amounting to lack of jurisdiction." (pp. 104-105, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the present recourse.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that there was grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the lower court in dismissing the complaint and in failing to resolve
its motion to admit amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, resort to the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> is proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal, however, of the said motion and a consideration of the
stage of the proceedings during which said motion was filed yield a finding contrary
to that asserted by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general policy, liberality in allowing amendments is
greatest in the early stages of a lawsuit, decreases as it progresses, and
changes at times to <span class="GramE">a strictness</span>, amounting to a
prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Torres v. <span class="SpellE">Tomacruz</span>, 49 Phil. 413, cited in Garcia Jr. v. <span class="SpellE">Ranada</span>, Jr. 166 SCRA 9) This is further restricted by the
condition that the amendment should not prejudice the adverse party or place
him at a disadvantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Shaffer v. <st1:city><st1:place>Palma</st1:place></st1:city>,
22 SCRA 934, also cited in Garcia, Jr. v. <span class="SpellE">Ranada</span>,
supra)</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no denying that an amendment could be introduced during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a Motion to Dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner’s insistence on this point is not <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
this is not the situation obtaining in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records show that when petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1983</st1:date> its Motion to
Admit Amended Complaint, the original complaint sought to be amended had
already been dismissed on <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8">August 12,
 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, there was
no more complaint to be amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the original complaint no longer <span class="GramE">exists,</span>
it has lost its standing and could not be amended unless its status is
restored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, an amendment at this
stage of the proceeding, when the com<span style="">plaint
</span>had already been dismissed, the writ of attachment discharged and
declared of no further force and effect will definitely work to the prejudice
and disadvantage of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been ruled that amendment will not be allowed when the same will
prejudice the adverse party or place him at a disadvantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Shaffer v. <st1:city><st1:place>Palma</st1:place></st1:city>,
supra)</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no grave abuse
of discretion on the part of the lower court in not granting and/or in failing
to act on petitioner's motion to admit amended complaint.</p>

<blockquote>"On the issue of whether the lower court's wisdom in allowing
or disallowing amendments may be the subject of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>,
We held in Philippine Surety and Insurance Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Jacale</span>,
et al. that where the issue or question involved affects the wisdom or legal
soundness of the decision, not the jurisdiction of the court to render said
decision or its validity, the same is beyond the province of a special civil
action for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is
too well-settled that the office of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> has been
reduced to the correction of defects of jurisdiction solely <span style="">and cannot legally be used for any other
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is truly an extraordinary
remedy and, in this jurisdiction, its use is restricted only to extraordinary
cases--cases in which the action of the inferior court is wholly void; where
any further steps in the case would result in a waste of time and money and
would produce no result whatever, where the parties, or their privies would be
utterly deceived; where a final judgment or decree would be naught but a snare
and delusion, deciding nothing, protecting nobody, a judicial pretension, a
recorded falsehood, a standing menace." (Garcia, </span><span style="">Jr. v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ranada</span></span><span style="">, Jr. supra)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It also bears stressing that, as correctly ruled by the
respondent Court of Appeals, the proper remedy available to herein petitioner
from the order dismissing the complaint is appeal, not a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the remedy of appeal is available,
the extra ordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> cannot be resorted to because
the availability of appeal proscribes recourse to the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Del <span class="SpellE">Pozo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Penaco</span>, 167 SCRA 577, 589)</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the respondent Court of Appeals was correct in
dismissing the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> filed by the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby DENIED and the
questioned decision of the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED.</p>
