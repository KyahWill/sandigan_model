APPEALS AND CHUA SENG, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to review that
portion of the decision of respondent Court of Appeals which merely reduced the
award of damages in favor of private respondent Chua Seng instead of
eliminating them entirely as well as that portion affirming the decision of the
Court of First Instance of Manila dismissing petitioner's complaint for
unlawful detainer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals’ resolution dated May 26, 1981 denying the
motion for reconsideration is like­wise sought to be reviewed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The uncontroverted facts of the case are summarized by the
respondent Court of Appeals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'Chua Seng and Dra. Paz Baens are lessee and lessor, respect­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ively, </span>bound by oral contract of lease
o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ver the premises subject of </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">controversy.  Chua began </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">tenure
as lessee since 1952.  On </span>October
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">5, 1975 Chua left </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the premises </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">be treated by </span>a hilot in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Valenzuela, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Bulacan.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">He brought with him his
clothes and other belongings but left in the premises the paraphernalia of his
store, his appliances, furnitures, kitchen utensils, tools, and </span>memorabilia
like picture frames, diplomas and certificate of merit and his credentials as
guerilla veteran.  Before he left, he
padlocked the steel door of the premises.  Next day, October 6, 1975, Chua Seng and his brother-in-law, Ong Hai,
returned to the premises.  They found
that in addition to the padlock of Chua placed, other padlocks were placed at
the door of the premises at the instance of Dra. Baens.  Chua Seng learned that Dra. Baens caused the
padlocking of the premises because when he inquired from his neighbor Mrs.
Asuncion Lim, the latter gave him a note (Exhibit 'E') sent by Dra. Baens to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Mrs. </span>Asuncion
Lim, asking the latter to padlock the premises to prevent loss or damage to the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">things inside the premises.  Chua Seng, Ong Hai and their spouses sought
the audience of Dra. Baens</span> at St. Paul Hospital; in that meet­ing, Dra.
Baens refused to remove the padlocks on the premises.  They also went to Dra. Baens' lawyer; but still the premises were
not opened.  Subsequently, Chua Seng
thru Atty. Mariano, wrote a letter dated November 17, 1975 to Dra. Baens
(Exhibit 'A'), tendering the rentals for October and November, 1975 by means of
a check and requesting the removal of the Dra, Baens' padlocks from the
premises.  To this letter, Atty. Guillermo
Ilagan, the lawyer of Dra. Baens, replied on November 20, 1975 (Exhibit
'B).  In such reply, the check tendered
by Chua Seng was returned with the following request:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'We would appreciate if you could advise your client to
remove whatever belonging he has on the premises in question within ten (10)
days from receipt of this letter; otherwise, we shall be constrained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to have it </span>opened because he has
absolutely <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">no </span>right to deprive
my client of the use of the property'.</p>

<blockquote>Atty. Mariano in turn, replied on November
25, 1975 (Exhibit 'C'), requesting that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">padlock placed by Dra. </span>Baens be removed; otherwise, legal
measures shall be taken.  Since nothing
happened after this exchange <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of </span>communications,
the controversy was brought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to Court.' </span>(Annex
H, pp. 5-7)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Chua Seng filed Civil Case No. 007466-CV for forcible entry with
the City Court of Manila against Dra. Baens Chua Seng alleged that Dra. Baens'
refusal to remove the padlocks was a breach of the contract of lease consisting
in the deprivation of plaintiff's right to occupy and use the leased pre­mises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 10, 1976, lessor Dra. Baens (herein petitioner)
expressed her assent to restore Chua Seng to the possession of the disputed
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 12, 1976, petitioner Baens filed her answer to the
complaint for forcible entry alleging inter alia that Chua Seng's right to
occupy said premises had long expired and that the respondent failed to pay the
rentals due and had voluntarily vacated the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 18, 1976, the petitioner filed with the City Court of
Manila her own complaint for unlawful detainer against lessee Chua Seng, alleg­ing
the same facts raised in her answer to Chua Seng's complaint for forcible
entry.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 10, 1976, private respondent Chua Seng filed his answer
to the petitioner's complaint for unlawful detainer setting forth the same
allega­tions averred in his own complaint for forcible entry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two cases were assigned to the same branch of the City Court
of Manila which conducted a joint trial and rendered a consolidated decision,
the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is
</span>hereby rendered in favor of Chua Seng, ordering Dra. Baens to restore
him to the possession and enjoyment of the leased premises at No. 2441
Oroquieta Street, Manila, and to pay him attorney's fees in the sum of P1,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For lack of merit, the complaint in Civil Case No. 008378-CV
is hereby DISMISSED, along with all other claims and counterclaims between the
parties in both cases.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the Court of First Instance of Manila
with the petitioner assailing in toto the decision while the private respondent
questioned only that portion which denied his claim for damages against
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 5, 1979, the Court of First Instance of Manila
rendered a decision affirming the City Court's decision relative to the
restoration of Chua Seng to possession of the premises and dismissing
petitioner's complaint for unlawful detainer, but reversing the decision
insofar as it only awarded said private respondent the sum of P1,000.00 for
attorney's fees and dismissed his other claim for damages.  The dispositive portion of the decision
reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">"WHEREF</span>ORE,
judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">"</span>1.  Affirming the decision of the City Court dated October 19, 1978
insofar as it restores Chua Seng to the possession and enjoyment of the leased
premises at No. 2441 Oroquieta Street, Manila and insofar as it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">dis</span>misses

sum of P1,000.00 and dismisses all other claims and counterclaims between the
parties in both cases.  Instead,

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">"</span>a.  The sum of P1,000.00 as actual damages per month from October 6,
1975 up to the time Chua Seng is restored to the possession of the premises;</p>

1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The costs of suit."'</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 20, 1979, the private respondent filed a motion for
immediate execution pending appeal which was granted in an order dated December
10, 1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed the above-mentioned deci­sion of the
Court of First Instance of Manila as well as the order granting the issuance of
a writ for immediate execution to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1981, the respondent Court of Appeals rendered its
decision annulling the order of the Court of First Instance granting immediate
execution and modifying the appealed decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with the only modi­fication above set forth,
reducing the award of moral damages to P3,000, exemplary damages to P2,000, and
the attorney's fees to P3,000, the judgment under review is hereby affirmed in all
other respects.  The order granting
execution pending appeal (Annex M) is hereby annulled and set aside.  No pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit in a
resolution dated May 26, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the Court of Appeals, the
petitioner now comes to this court through this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
raising the following grounds:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:10.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
10.0pt;margin-left:0in">I</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Court of Appeals committed a grave error of law in
merely reducing, instead of elimi­nating the award for alleged moral and
exemplary damages to private respondent Chua Seng and in not applying to
petitioner, the decision of this Honorable Court in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">case </span>of Reyes vs. Court of Appeals, 38 SCRA 138, which limited
the kind of damages recoverable in actions for forcible entry and detainer to
such damages caused by the loss of the use and occupation of the property.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:10.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
10.0pt;margin-left:0in">II</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Court of Appeals committed a grave error of law in
affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance awarding private
respondent Chua Seng the sum of P1,000.00 as actual damages from October 5,
1975 up to the time said private respondent is restored in possession and in
not applying the decision of this Honorable Court in the case of Torres vs.
Ocampo, 80 Phil, 36, in resolving the propriety of said award.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:10.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
10.0pt;margin-left:0in">III</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Court of Appeals committed a grave error of law when it
affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance dismissing petitioner's
complaint for unlawful detainer on a misapplication of Presidential Decree No.
20.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner submits that damages which the plaintiff may claim
in an action for forcible entry and detainer are only those which he may have
sustained as a mere possessor and are limited only to such damages as are
caused by his loss of the use and occupation of the property, but not those
which he may suffer having no direct relation to such use and occupation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent Chua Seng anchors his claim
for moral and exemplary damages on Art. 32 of the Civil Code of the Philippines
which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 32.  Any public
officer or employee, or any private individual, who directly or indirectly
obstructs, defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs any of the
following rights and liber­ties of another person shall be liable to the latter
for damages:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(10) The liberty of abode and changing the same;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The indemnity shall include moral damages.  Exemplary damages may also be
adjudicated."</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 1 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">SECTION </span>1.  <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Who </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

provisions of the next succeed­ing section, a person deprived of the possession
of any land or build­ing by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth,
or a landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person against whom the possession of
any land or building is unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination
of the right to hold possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied,
or the legal representatives or assigns of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">any </span>such landlord, vendor, vendee, or other person, may, at any
time within one (1) year after such unlawful deprivation or withholding of
possession, bring an action in the proper inferior court against the person or
persons unlawfully with­holding or depriving of possession, or any person or
persons claiming under them, for the restitution of such possession, <u>together
with damages and costs</u>.  The
complaint must be verified." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Reyes v. Court of
Appeals</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (38 SCRA 138), </span>interprets
the scope of damages that may be recovered in an action for forcible
entry.  It states:</p>

<blockquote>"On the last issue of whether temperate damages may be awarded
in favor of respondent landlord, it has been held that while damages may be
adjudged in forcible entry and detainer cases, these 'damages' mean 'rents' or
'the reasonable compensation for the use and occupation of the premises,' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Mitschiener </span>v. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Barrios, 76 </span>Phil. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">55, cited in Garcia </span>v. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Peña, 77 Phil. </span>1011) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or 'fair rental value of the property.' </span>(Sparrevohn
v. Fisher, 2 Phil. 676; Mitschiener v. Barrios, <u>supra</u>; Castueras v.
Bayona, 106 Phil. 340).  Profits which
the plaintiff might have received were it not for the forcible entry or
detainer do not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">re</span>present a fair
rental value.  (Sparrevhon v. Fisher, 2
Phil. 676; <u>supra</u>; Igama v. Soria, 42 Phil. 11)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Although Section 1 of Rule 70 uses the
word "damages", the authors of the Rules of Court, in drafting
Section 6 of Rule 70 on the judgment to be pronounced, eliminated the word
"damages", placing in lieu thereof, the words "reasonable
compensation for the use and occupation of the premises."</p>

<p class="BODY">We also had occasion to explain the meaning of damages in <u>Ramirez
v. Sy Chit</u>, (21 SCRA 1364) where we held:</p>

<blockquote>"The trial court held defendant liable 'to pay plaintiff the
sum of P25,00 a day for every day of delay as damages until he finally vacates
the premises, in addition to the agreed current rental that may accrue.' This
is an error, The damages recoverable by the plaintiff under section 1, Rule 70
(formerly Rule 72) are those which correspond to the reasonable value of the
use and occupation of the property, which in this case is the agreed monthly
rental of P230.00.  The award, therefore,
of P25.00 as damages for every day of delay in addition to the agreed monthly
rentals is without basis in law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The damages which a plaintiff expects to obtain from his business
to be located in the premises, or for material injury caused to the premises
cannot also be claimed in connection with or as incidental to an action of
illegal detainer or forcible entry.  (Torres v. Ocampo, 80 Phil. 36)</p>

<p class="BODY">Since moral, exemplary, and actual damages are neither
"rents" nor "reasonable compensation for the use and occupation
of the premises", nor "fair rental value" as abovestated, we are
constrained to deny the P3,000.00 moral damages and P2,000.00 exemplary damages
awarded by the respondent Court of Appeals and the P1,000.00 actual damages
awarded by the City Court of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's reliance on Art. 32 of the Civil Code is
inappropriate.  The personal freedoms
protected by that provision refer to the right to transfer from one place to
another and to choose one's residence.  It is a recognition of the freedom of a person to have his home in a
place chosen by him and, thereafter, to change it without interference from
Government except upon lawful order of the court, or when necessary in the
interest of national security, public safety, or public health.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue raised by the petitioner is pre­dicated on her
contention that the lease contract between her and Chua Seng had expired.  The contract of lease was verbal.  It had no fixed terms and rentals were paid
every month.  Applying Article 1687 of
the Civil Code, petitioner Baens states that since the rentals agreed upon were
paid monthly, then the term of the lease should be understood to be on a month
to month basis.  The petitioner contends
that Presidential Decree No. 20 covers only leases of dwelling units where the
rental is P300.00 or less a month and, therefore, does not apply to this case
where the rental is P390.00 a month.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 20 basically covers two distinct
matters.  First is the prohibition
against the increase of the monthly rental agreed upon between the lessor and
the lessee when said rental does not exceed P300,00 a month and second is the
suspen­sion of Paragraph I, Article 1673 of the Civil Code insofar as it refers
to dwelling units or land on which another's dwelling is located.  Paragraph I of Article 1673 of the Civil
Code governs the termi­nation of contracts of lease which are on a year to
year, month to month, week to week, or day to day basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Rantael v. Court of Appeals, et al (97 SCRA 453), although the
lease was on a month to month basis, we ordered the surrender of the premises
to the lessor because the duration of the lease was fixed in a written
agreement between the parties.  However,
even if the month to month arrangement is on a verbal basis, if it is shown
that the lessor needs the pro­perty for his own use or for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">use </span>of an
immediate member of the family or for any of the other statutory grounds to
eject under Section 5 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25, which happens to be
applicable, then the lease is considered terminated as of the end of the month,
after proper notice or demand to vacate has been given.  (See Crisostomo v. Court of Appeals, 116
SCRA 199).</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of law suspending the application of Paragraph I,
Article 1673 of the Civil Code is now Section 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.  <u>Application
of the </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">Civil </span>Code and
Rules of Court of the Philippines</u>. - Except when the lease is for a
definite period, the provi­sions of paragraph (1) of Article 1673 of the Civil
Code of the Philippines insofar as they refer to residential units covered by
this Act shall be suspended during the effectivity of this Act but other
provisions of the Civil Code and the Rules of Court on lease contracts, insofar
as they are not in conflict with the provisions of this Act, shall apply."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not the leased premises with a monthly rental of
P390.00 are covered by Section 6 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25, we note that the
abovecited section is applicable to "residential units covered by this
Act." "Residential unit" is defined under Section 2 as:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 2.  <u>Definition of
Terms</u>. - Unless otherwise indicated whereever in this Act, the following
terms shall have the following meaning:</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b. A
residential unit-refers to an apartment, house and/or land on which another's
dwelling is located used for residential purposes and shall include not only
buildings, parts or units thereof used solely as dwelling places, except
motels, motel rooms, hotels, hotel rooms, boarding houses, dormitories, rooms
and bed spaces for rent, but also those used for home industries, retail stores
or other business purposes if the owner thereof and his family actually live
therein and use it principally for dwelling purposes:  <u>Provided</u>, That in the case of a retail store, home
industry or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">business, </span>the
capitalization thereof shall not exceed five thousand pesos (P5,000.00):  and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Provided</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><u>further</u>, That in the
operation of the store, industry or business, the owner thereof shall not
require the services of any person other than the immediate members of his
family."</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The definition does not provide a rental ceiling beyond which the
law no longer applies.  Are <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">all </span>residential units as defined above
covered by the suspension of Paragraph I, Article 1673 of the Civil Code
irregardless of how much are the monthly rentals of the units?</p>

<p class="BODY">We answer this question in the negative.  The title of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 – An Act
Regulating Rentals Of Dwelling Units Or Of Land On Which Another's Dwelling Is
Located And For Other Purposes – shows that the subject matter of the law is
the regulation of rentals.  The
definition must, therefore, be related to the subject matter as stated in the
title.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Sections 1 and 7 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 provide:</p>
