				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a motion for reconsideration of the Court's Resolution,
dated 29 May 1989, which denied the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
dated 5 October 1988 for failure of petitioner to sufficiently show that the
Court of Appeals had committed any reversible error in issuing the questioned
judgment of 29 April 1988 and resolution of 19 August 1988 in CA-G.R. No.
05035.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his motion for reconsideration, petitioner prays that the <span class="SpellE">abovesaid</span> resolution of 29 May 1989 be reconsidered on the
ground that the petition for review dated 5 October 1988 did not limit itself
to the issues upon which the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 29 April
1988 and its resolution dated 19 August 1988 were based, namely, strict <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">interpretation of the rules of procedure and
technicality, but rather the petition presented the substance and merits of the
case so that this Court may fully appreciate the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has taken a second look at the facts of the case and
the various arguments propounded by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court grants the motion for
reconsideration.</p>

as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>naturalized
Filipino citizen of Korean descent, is employed as a researcher in the

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner was denied by
the appellate court for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, petitioner filed with this Court his <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
petition for review on <i>certiorari,</i> where he raised two (2) issues,
namely:</p>

<blockquote>I<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether or not the decisions of the Muni­cipal
Circuit Trial Court and the RTC are supported by the facts and evidence or
contrary to law and that the two courts a quo have acted with grave abuse of
dis­cretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or have acted without or in
excess of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>whether or not the decision of the Hon. Court
of Appeals is contrary to law, established jurisdiction, equity and due
process.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that his liability, if any, is only civil and
not criminal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that he
received the money in the form of cash advance with the obligation to liquidate
the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure on his part to
liquidate the said amount or part thereof automatically vests authority on
SEAFDEC to deduct liquidated but unreturned amount from the salary or other
benefits due him from SEAFDEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>matter of fact, he argues, pursuant
to the recommendation of the Internal Audit Section of SEAFDEC, there was an
actual deduction from his salary equivalent to the questioned amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner asserts that cash advances partake
of the nature of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>loan where
the relationship of debtor and creditor is clearly established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money received is in the form of loan
which is known as <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">mutuum</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It
is a loan for consumption and the ownership of the thing loaned passes to the
borrower.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was not under obligation to
return the same money that he received, so petitioner contends.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further asserts that the real reason the criminal
complaints were filed against him was to discri­minate against him on the part
of the previous SEAFDEC Management under Dr. <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Miravite</span> and Dr. Alfredo Santiago, who both wanted to
get rid of petitioner as they suspected him of being the source of newspaper
publications exposing financial corruption and looting of SEAFDEC funds by top
management officials during the administration of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Miravite</span>; that after the change of administration, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the new management found it unnecessary,
impractical, </span>worthless and unjust to proceed with the other case
(Criminal Case No. 631).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the dismissal of the said other case.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner then </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">points </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

his employer SEAFDEC of dishonesty arising from the same travel funds involved
in the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases filed against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC, according to petitioner, affirmed

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the second issue,
petitioner contends that all actions taken by him to protect his rights were
done in good faith or in honest mistake and were never designed to disre­gard

the Court of Appeals for proper disposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cites the following cases in support of his arguments:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span> it would be unfair to deprive

<p class="BODY">Lastly, petitioner contends that "the underlying prin­ciple

<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Lungsod</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Maynila</span> vs. IAC</u>, 143 SCRA
311, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">FJR </span>Garments Industries
vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 130 SCRA 216, and <span class="SpellE"><u>Patalinghug</u></span><u>
vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 137 SCRA 487, to further support his prayer for
dismissal of the case for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Comment (should be Reply) of counsel for petitioner,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
said counsel submits that the above cases cited by the Solicitor General do not
apply squarely to the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pamantasan</u></span> case,
petitioner avers that this Court was apparently persuaded to dismiss the case
by its conclusion that a contrary ruling allowing due course to review would
not have helped the petitioner anyway because the case was not meritorious,
which is not true in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>FJR Garments</u> case, aside from the procedural error
committed by petitioner therein, this Court took into account other
circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, while the
petitioner had still two (2) days left within which to correct itself by filing
an appeal bond and paying a docket fee, it filed a petition for relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Patalinghug</u></span>
case, the Court found that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period
for filing a petition for review lapsed while petitioner was going through the
motions of his erroneous procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the cases cited by the Solicitor General find no
application to the present case, according to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that the petitioner received on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">10 August 1987</st1:date> the RTC decision dated
<st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="7">30 July 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following day, <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">11 August 1987</st1:date>, he filed his Notice of
Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On order of the trial court,
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="8">12 August 1987</st1:date>, the
records of the case were elevated to the Court of Appeals which received them
on <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="10">8 October 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that "while the Notice of Appeal may be
considered a procedural <u>faux</u> <u>pas</u> as a mode of elevating the
decision of the trial court", the petition for review which he
subsequently filed on 30 October 1987 in the Court of Appeals was meant to cure
the said procedural defect which the appellate court should have favorably
considered.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In several cases decided by this Court, it had set aside
technicalities in the Rules in order to give way to justice and equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, we note that the
petitioner, in filing his Notice of Appeal the very next day after receiving
the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, lost no time in showing his
intention to appeal, although the procedure taken was not correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can overlook the wrong pleading
filed, if strict compliance with the rules would mean sacrificing justice to
technicality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The imminence of a person
being deprived unjustly of his liberty due to procedural lapse of counsel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>strong and compelling reason to warrant suspension of the
Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we shall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">consider the petition for review filed in the
Court of Appeals as a Supplement to the Notice of Appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Court declared in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Conscience cannot rest in allowing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

entreaty for a full opportunity to be heard, even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

meritorious cause, simply because he had chosen an appeal route, to be sure,
recognized by law but made inapplicable to his case, under altered rules of
procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the Court of Appeals
can not be faulted and, in fact, it has to be lauded for correctly applying the
rules of procedure in appeals to the Court of Appeals from decisions of the RTC
rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction, yet, this Court, as the
ultimate bulwark of human rights and individual liberty, will not allow
substantial justice to be sacrificed at the altar of procedural rigor.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, no substantial injury to any party will result from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">this </span>decision to accord petitioner

State, the acquittal of the innocent should be as much its concern as the
conviction of the guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court Resolves (a) to SET ASIDE the Resolution
