				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> which questions the
order of the respondent court granting the Motion for Allowance filed by
private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said order reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the Motion For Allowance dated June 30, 1982 filed
by Victor, Rodrigo, <span class="SpellE">Anselmina</span> and Miguel, all
surnamed <span class="SpellE">Santero</span>, thru their guardian, <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> Diaz, the Opposition thereto dated July 8, 1982
filed by the <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span>, the Reply to Opposition
dated July 12, 1982 filed by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> Diaz and the Rejoinder dated July 26, 1982 filed by
the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, the Court was constrained to examine
the Motion For Allowance filed by the herein <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
last year wherein the ground cited was for sup­port which included educational
expenses, cloth­ing and medical necessities, which was <span class="GramE">granted</span>
and said minors were given an allowance prayed for in their motion.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the Motion <span class="GramE">For</span> Allowance in
question guardian-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Anselma</span>
Diaz only followed the precedent of the Court which granted a similar motion
last year to be spent for the school expenses of her wards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their opposition the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
contend that the wards for whom allowance is sought are no longer schooling and
have attained majority age so that they are no longer under guardianship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They likewise allege that the administrator
does not have sufficient funds to cover the said allowance because whatever funds
are in the hands of the administrator, they constitute funds held in trust for
the benefit of whoever will be adjudged as owners of the <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>
property from which said administrator derives the only income of the intestate
estate of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Santero</span>, et al.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the Reply filed by the guardian-<span class="SpellE">movant</span>,
she admitted some of her children are of age and not enrolled for the first
semester due to lack of funds but will be enrolled as soon<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> as they are given the requested
allowances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cited Article 290 of the
Civil Code provid­ing that:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Support is everything that is indispensable for substance,
dwelling, clothing and medical attendance, accord­ing to the social position of
the family.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Support also includes the <u>educa­tion</u> of the person entitled
to be sup­ported until he completes his education or training for some trade or
vocation, even beyond the age of majority.'</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">citing</span> also Section 3 of Rule 83 of the
Rules of Court which provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">'Allowance to widow and family.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The widow and minor or incapacitated children
of a deceased person, during the settlement of the estate, shall receive <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, under the direction of the Court, such allowance
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as provi­</span>ded by law.'</p>

<blockquote>From the foregoing discussion alone, the
Court cannot deviate from its duty to give the allowance sought by the wards,
the fact that they need further education which should have been provided to
them if their deceased father were alive.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"On the allegation
that the funds from </span>which the allowance would be derived are trust
funds, the Court, time and again had emphasized that the estate of the <span class="SpellE">Santeros</span> is quite big and the amount to be released for
allowances is indeed insignificant and which can easily be replaced from its
general fund if the so-called trust fund is adjudicated to the <span class="SpellE">opposi­tors</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, Victor, Rodrigo, <span class="SpellE">Anselmina</span>
and Miguel, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Santero</span> are hereby granted
an allowance of two thousand (P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) pesos each
for tuition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fees, clothing </span>materials
and subsistence out of any available funds in the hands of the administrator
who is ordered to reimburse to them the said amount after this order shall have
become final to enable the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to file their
appeal by <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>if they so desire within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not

on the allegations of the said respondents that the <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span>
wards are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">still </span>schooling and
they are in actual need of money to defray their school expenses for 1982-83

determine the truth of allegations of the private respondents.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that private respondents are not entitled to
any allowance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">since
they have already attained </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">majority
age, two are gainfully <span class="GramE">employed</span> and one is </span>married
as provided for under Sec. 3 Rule 83, of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also allege that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was misrepres</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">entation on </span>the part of the guardian
in asking for allow­ance for tuition fees, books and other school materials and
other miscellaneous expenses for school term 1982-83 because these wards have
already attained majority age so that they are no longer under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">gua</span>r<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">dianship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>They further
allege that the administrator of the estate of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Santero</span>
does not have sufficient <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">funds to cover
</span>said allowance because whatever funds are in the hands <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the administrator constitute funds
held in trust for the benefit of whoever will be adjudged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>owners of the <span class="SpellE">Kawit</span>
properties from where these funds now held by the administrator are derived.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the question of whether the pri­vate
respondents are entitled to allowance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">or
</span>not concerns only the intestate estate of the late Pablo <span class="SpellE">Santero</span> and not the intestate estates of <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> <span class="SpellE">Santero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamuti</span>, parents of their
late legitimate son Pablo <span class="SpellE">Santero</span>. The reason for
this is Art. <span class="GramE">992 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">New Civil </span>Code which states that "An
illegitimate child has no right to inherit <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">intestato</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>from the legitimate children and
relatives of his father or mother; nor shall such children or relatives inherit
in the same manner from the illegitimate child."</span> The question of
whether or not the petitioners and private respondents are entitled to inherit
by right of representation from their grandparents more particularly from <span class="SpellE">Si­mona</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamuti</span> was settled by Us
in the related case of "<span class="SpellE">Anselma</span> Diaz, et al vs. <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamuti-Jardin</span>" (G.R.
No. 66574-R) wherein We held that in view of the barrier present in said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Art. 992, petitioners and private respondents
are <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">excluded </span>from the intestate
estate of <span class="SpellE">Simona</span> <span class="SpellE">Pamuti</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The present petition
obviously lacks merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The controlling provision
of law is not Rule 83, Sec. 3 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the New Rules of Court but Arts.
290 and 188 of the Civil Code reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 290.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Support is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">everything that </span>is indispensable for
sustenance, dwelling, clothing and medical attendance, according to the social
position of the family.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Support also includes the education of the person entitled to be
supported until he completes his education or training for some profession,
trade or vocation, even beyond the age of majority."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 188.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the
common mass of pro­perty support shall be given to the surviving spouse and to
the children during the liquida­tion of the inventoried property and until what
belongs to them is delivered; but from this shall be deducted that amount
received for sup­port which exceeds the fruits or rents pertaining to
them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that private respondents are of age, gainfully employed,
or married is of no moment and should not be regarded as the determining factor
of their right to allow­ance under Art. 188.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While the Rules of Court limit allowances to the widow and minor or
incapacitated children of the deceased, the New Civil Code gives the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">surviving spouse </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and his/her children without
distinction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the private
respondents Victor, Rodrigo, <span class="SpellE">Anselmina</span> and Miguel all
sur­named <span class="SpellE">Santero</span> are entitled to allowances as
advances from their shares in the inheritance from their father Pablo <span class="SpellE">Sante­ro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the
provision of the Civil Code, a substantive law, gives the surviving spouse and
to the children the right to receive support during the liquidation of the
estate of the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">deceased, such right cannot be impaired by
Rule 83 Sec. 3 of </span>the Rules of Court which is a procedural <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Be it noted </span>however that with respect to "spouse," <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">same must be </span>the "legitimate
spouse" (not common-law spouses <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">who
are the </span>mothers of the children here).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not true that the Motion for Allowance was granted by
respondent Court without hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
record <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">shows </span>that
the "Motion for Allowance" dated </span><st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">June 30, </span>1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> contains</span> a <u>Notice</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

same date of hearing of the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">even the instant pe­</span>tition
admits that the wards, (petitioners and private res­pondents as represented by
their respective guardians) "have been granted allowances for school
expenses for about 8 years now." The respondent court in granting the
motion for allow­ance merely "followed the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
