Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 30461 as security for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">payment of a one million peso promissory note
in favor of </span>the mortgagee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
mortgagors were unable to pay their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">obligation,

the additional consideration of P500,000.00; they jointly agree to cede,
transfer and convey to the Council the land they mortgaged to the </span>latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="2">February

<p class="BODY">Subsequent thereto, on August 8, 1985, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>

</span>The case is docketed as Civil Case No. Q-46196.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While this case was pending, on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1987</st1:date>, the heirs of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, private respondents herein, filed with the
Court of Appeals a petition to annul the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-43746 for
foreclosure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of their
petition the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> narrated the following
events:<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(1) on <st1:date year="1953" day="20" month="12">December 20,
 1953</st1:date> Jesus <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
purchased the 4,754 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>. parcel of land located in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> from the Spouses Garcia and since then he and his
family have always been in possession thereof;<span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(2) for some reason known only to <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
and Fred <span class="SpellE">Da</span> Silva, an employee of the former, title
to the property was placed in the latter's name as evidenced by TCT No. 30461
although from the time of its issuance the owner's duplicate copy of said TCT
has always been in the possession of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(3) on January 31, 1963, the parties decided to terminate the
trust that had been created over the property, thus, <span class="SpellE">Da</span>
Silva executed a deed of sale over the same parcel of land in favor of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> but no consideration was given by the latter to the
former for said sale and any recital consideration appearing in the deed is purely
fictitious;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) the Register of Deeds, however, refused to register the deed
of sale because the title is in the name of "Fred <span class="SpellE">Da</span>
Silva married to <span class="SpellE">Leocadia</span> <span class="SpellE">Da</span>
Silva" and is thus presumed conjugal and the conjugal partnership should
first be liquidated as the wife had already died;</p>

<p class="BODY">(5) alleging that their copy was lost and/or destroyed, on
February 1, 1984 Freddie and Marconi <span class="SpellE">Da</span> Silva, two of
the three surviving children of Fred <span class="SpellE">Da</span> Silva who
died in 1963, filed a petition, docketed as LRC record Case No. Q-2772, for the
issuance of a new copy of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 30461.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition was granted by Judge Vera on <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1984</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="BODY">(6) <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> learned about this and
immediately filed a motion to re-open the proceedings stating that he has in
his possession the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 30461 and explaining the
reasons for such possession;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">(7) the motion was granted and on December 7, 1984 the land
registration court ordered the <span class="SpellE">Da</span> <span class="SpellE">Silvas</span>
to (a) return to the Register of Deeds the second owner's duplicate copy of the
title and (b) neither enter into any transaction concerning said second owner's
duplicate copy nor utilize the title for any purpose other than to return the
same to the Register of Deeds;</p>

<p class="BODY">(8) on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="11">November 11,
 1985</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Da</span> <span class="SpellE">Silvas</span>
manifested before the land registration court that the title to the property
was transferred to the Council based on a compromise agreement in Civil Case
No. Q-43746 for foreclosure; and,</p>

<p class="BODY">(9) on motion of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
who substituted him upon his death in 1985, Judge Vera consolidated Civil Cases
Nos. Q-2772 and Q-43469, both of which were raffled to his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>,
with Civil Case No. Q-46196 but the judge hearing the latter case would not
heed the order of consolidation.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and then set out their case for annulment
of judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">alleging that the <span class="SpellE">Da</span> <span class="SpellE">Silvas</span>, with the connivance of
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Council, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">executed a purported promissory note secured
by a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">real state</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> mortgage the terms and conditions of which

always known of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta's</span> claim of </span>ownership

of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> in their petition prayed, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, that (1) the judgment in Civil Case No. Q-43746 be
annulled and set aside and (2) a restraining order be issued to </span>enjoin
the proceedings in Civil Case No. Q-46196 [Petition, Annex "A".]<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same resolution the
parties were ordered to appear for a pre-trial conference.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Council filed a motion for
reconsideration of this resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later on the Council filed a Supplement to </span>Motion for

also invoked the additional grounds of lack of cause of action because the <span class="SpellE">Aranetas</span> are not valid claimants of the property; lack of
legal capacity to sue because the <span class="SpellE">Aranetas</span> were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not </span>parties to the foreclosure case; <span class="SpellE">litis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendentia</span> because<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner contends the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>first, that the Court of
Appeals should not continue to hear the petition </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">annulment of
judgment since it is already fully executed and the purpose for which the case
for annulment was filed will no longer be served, the parties having already
complied with the decision; second, private respondents have no right to
question the validity or legality of the decision rendered foreclosing the mortgage
since they are foreign to the transaction of mortgage between petitioner and
Freddie and Marconi <span class="SpellE">Da</span> Silva; lastly petitioner
claims that private respondents have another remedy in law and that is in Civil
Case No. Q-46196 for Quieting of Title where the question of ownership </span>may
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be passed upon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At the outset it must be
clarified that the instant petition is one for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65
of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the inquiry
this Court should address itself is limited to error of jurisdiction or grave
abuse of discretion committed by the Court of Appeals, in particular, whether
or not respondent court acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion in giving due course to the petition for annulment of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This clarification is rendered necessary
because the parties themselves, in their pleadings, have gone beyond this issue
and have discussed the merits of the annulment of judgment case now pending
decision with the Court of </span>Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its Petition, the
Council contends that a Regional Trial Court has the authority and jurisdiction
to annul a judgment of another Regional Trial Court, a coordinate or co-equal
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, petitioner alleges
that the filing of a separate action </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">annulment of judgment is unnecessary because the Regional Trial Court
hearing Civil Case No. Q-43469 for Quieting of Title can annul the judgment in
Civil Case No. Q-43746 for </span>Foreclosure rendered by another Regional
Trial Court [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 15-16.] In its Memorandum,
however, the Council admitted that the Court of Appeals has the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exclusive jurisdiction to annul the decision
of the Regional Trial Court [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 152-153.]</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Annulment of judgment is a remedy in law independent of the case
where the judgment sought to be annulled was rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judgment may be annulled on the ground of
extrinsic or collateral fraud [<span class="SpellE">Canlas</span> v. Hon. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 77691, <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="8">August 8,
 1988</st1:date>.] Jurisdiction over actions for annulment of Regional Trial
Court judgment has been clarified by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 (otherwise known as The Judiciary Reorganization
Act of 1980).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the enactment of
this law, different views had been entertained regarding the issue of whether
or not a branch of a Regional Trial Court may annul <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>judgment of another branch of the same court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Arial;mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol"><span style="mso-char-type:symbol;mso-symbol-font-family:Symbol">*</span></span></span></a>
However, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
129 introduced a new provision conferring on the Court of Appeals exclusive
original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of judgments of Regional Trial
Courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 9 (2) of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 expressly provides
that:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b>Jurisdiction</b>.
- The Court of Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">shall </span>exercise:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">* * *<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for annulment of
judgments of Regional Trial Courts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, it is beyond dispute that it is
only the Court of Appeals that can take cognizance of the annulment of judgment
in Civil Case No. Q-43746 rendered by the Regional Trial Court.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The next issue raised in this petition deals with the question of
who may properly institute a petition for annulment of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is petitioner's contention that the remedy
is available only to one who is a party to the case where the judgment sought
to be annulled is rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents,
on the other hand, allege that "there are sufficient facts and circumstances
sufficient to show prima facie that [they] have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>substantial interest in the ownership of the property which
had been foreclosed without their knowledge and consent" [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">p. </span>90.]
In fine, the question deals with whether or not the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> have a cause of action against the Council.</p>

January 19, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1966 </span>when . . . <span class="SpellE">Belosillo</span> caused the execution thereof after [<span class="SpellE">Militante</span>] had already instituted his civil case for
damages against . . . <span class="SpellE">Edrosolano</span> and an order for
issuance of preliminary attachment issued" [at 477.] The trial court
however dismissed <span class="SpellE">Militante's</span> action for annulment on
finding that it did not state a cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Militante</span>
filed an appeal to this Tribunal and in setting aside the trial court's order
of dismissal, the Court, speaking through then Mr. Associate Justice Enrique
Fernando, stated that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More specifically,
the view entertained by the lower court in its order of dismissal that an
action for annulment of judgment can be availed of only by those principally or
secondarily bound is contrary to what had been so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">clearly d</span>eclared by this Court in the leading case of Anuran v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> [38 Phil. 29], decided <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in </span>1918.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
emphatically announced therein:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"There can be no question as to the
right of any person adversely affected by a judgment to maintain an action to
enjoin its enforcement and to have it declared a nullity on the ground of fraud
and collusion practiced in the very matter of obtaining the judgment when </span></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">such </span></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">fraud is </span>e</b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">xtrinsic
or collateral to the matters involved in the issues raised at the trial which
resulted </span></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">such judgment</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>*
* *." [at 32-33.] Such a principle was further fortified by an observation
made by this Court through Justice <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> in <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span> [74 Phil.
25 (1942).] These are his words:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"The collusive conduct of the parties in the foreclosure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">suit </span>constituted an extrinsic or
collateral fraud by reason of which the judgment rendered therein may be
annulled in this separate action [citing also the case of Anuran.] Aside from
the Anuran-<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> case, innumerable authorities <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">from </span>other jurisdictions may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">be </span>cited in support of the
annulment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But were there not any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">precedent </span>to guide us, reason and
justice would compel us to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">lay </span>down
such doctrine for the first time." [at 481-482; Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore clear from the foregoing that a person need not
be a party to the judgment sought to be annulled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is essential is that he can prove his
allegation that the judgment was obtained by the use of fraud and collusion and
he would be adversely affected thereby.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this present case it is true that the heirs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
are not parties to the foreclosure case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither are they principally nor secondarily bound by the judgment
rendered therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>their petition filed with the Court
of Appeals they alleged fraud and connivance perpetuated by and between the <span class="SpellE">Da</span> <span class="SpellE">Silvas</span> and the Council as
would adversely affect them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
allegation, if fully substantiated by preponderance of evidence, could be the
basis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span>the annulment of Civil
Case No. Q-43476.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Council asserts that the remedy of annulment of
judgment applies only to final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment
and not to that which had already been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fully
</span>executed or implemented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Council's </span>contention that as
the judgment in the foreclosure case had already been executed evidenced by the
fact that title to the property in question had been transferred in its name
the judgment can no longer be annulled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Council's contention is devoid of m<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">erit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Garchitorena</u></span> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Sotelo</u></span>,
<u>supra</u>, the Court affirmed the trial court's annulment of the judgment on
foreclosure notwithstanding the fact that ownership of the house and lot
subject of the mortgage had passed from the mortgagee who foreclosed the
mortgage and purchased the property at public auction to a person who bought
the same and finally to another individual in whose name the Torrens certificate
of title stood by the time the case reached this Tribunal.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing the Court finds that the Court of
Appeals neither acted without jurisdiction nor committed grave abuse of
discretion in giving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">due </span>course
to the petition for annulment of judgment as would warrant the issuance of the
extraordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i> in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is DISMISSED and the
