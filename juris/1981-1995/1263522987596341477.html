At about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon of October 26, 1971, the accused 
Rudy Tiongson escaped from the Municipal Jail of Bulalacao, Oriental 
Mindoro, together with George de la Cruz and Rolando Santiago, where 
they were detained under the charge of Attempted Homicide.  While in the
 act of escaping, the said Rudy Tiongson killed Pat. Zosimo Gelera, a 
member of the police force of Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro, who was 
guarding the said accused, and PC Constable Aurelio Canela of the PC 
Detachment stationed in Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro, who went in pursuit
 of them.
<p>
By reason thereof, Rudy Tiongson was charged with Murder, in two separate informations, committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1. <em>Crim. Case No. R-DJC-243:
    </em> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on the 26th day of October, 1971, at 6:00 o'clock in the 
evening, more or less, at Rizal, of the Municipality of Bulalacao, 
Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction 
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, RUDY TIONGSON, 
conspiring and confederating with Rolando Santiago and George de la 
Cruz, who are both at large by reason of their forced escape, and with 
treachery, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously waited in ambush, 
waylaid and shot one C2C AURELIO M. CANELA, a member of the local 
Philippine Constabulary Command, while the latter was in hot pursuit of 
said accused who had earlier escaped from custody, thus fatefully 
resulting to the instantaneous death of the victim. </p>
    <p> That the commission of the offense was qualified by the 
circumstance of treachery, and aggravated by the circumstances of 
evident premeditation, in contempt of or with insult to the public 
authorities, nocturnity, committed in an uninhabited place and with 
abuse of superior strength."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    2. <em>Crim. Case No. R-DJC-244
    </em> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on the 26th day of October, 1971, at 5:30 o'clock in the 
afternoon, more or less, inside of the Municipal Building, of the 
Municipality of Bulalacao, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named 
accused, RUDY TIONGSON, conspiring and confederating with George de la 
Cruz and Rolando Santiago, and under the pretext that they would answer 
the call of nature, convinced Police First Class Patrolman Zosimo Gelera
 to allow them to go out from their being confined and detained in the 
Municipal Jail of same Municipality by virtue of a previous offense, and
 while still hardly out of said jail, ganged up said Zosimo Gelera, took
 the latter's service pistol, and with it, with treachery, shot point 
blank said police officer at his right cheek, tragically resulting to 
the victim's instantaneous death, and thereafter, made good their 
escape. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> That the offense is qualified by the circumstance of treachery, 
and aggravated by the circumstances of evident premeditation, in 
contempt of or with insult to the public authorities and with abuse of 
superior strength."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon arraignment, the said accused, assisted by counsel de oficio, 
pleaded guilty to both informations.  The trial court, however, did not 
render judgment out­right, but ordered the prosecution to present its 
evidence, after which, it sentenced the said accused to suffer the death
 penalty in each case, to indemnify the heirs of the victims in the 
amount of P12,000.00, and to pay the costs.
</p><p>
The death penalty having been imposed, the cases are now before the Court for mandatory review.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1. Able counsel appointed for the accused first claims that the 
acceptance of the plea of guilty was precipitate since the trial judge 
did not ascertain from the accused that the latter was aware of the 
consequences of his plea of guilty and that he fully understood the 
significance and meaning thereof.  Wherefore, he prays that the cases be
 returned to the court below for proper proceedings.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The norm that should be followed where a plea of guilty is entered by 
the defendant, especially in cases where the capital penalty may be 
imposed, is that the court should be sure that defendant fully 
understands the nature of the charges preferred against him and the 
character of the punishment provided by law before it is imposed.  For 
this reason, the Court requires that in every case under a plea of 
guilty, where the penalty may be death, the trial court should call 
witnesses for the purpose of establishing the guilt and degree of 
culpability of the defendant and not only to satisfy the trial judge but
 to aid the Supreme Court in determining whether accused really and 
truly understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and 
consequences of his plea.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the instant case, the trial judge required the taking of testimony as
 to the circumstances under which the crime was committed before passing
 judgment so that the resulting verdict cannot in any way be branded as 
deficient.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 2. Counsel also contends that the evidence present­ed by the 
prosecution does not warrant, nor support, the finding that the killing 
of Pat. Zosimo Gelera was qualified by treachery since the prosecution 
failed to present any eyewitness who directly saw the killing of Pat. 
Gelera.  The Solicitor General agrees with counsel for the accused. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to the Revised Penal Code,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  "there is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes 
against the person, employing means, methods, or forms in the execution 
thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, 
without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended 
party might make."
</p><p>
In the instant case, it does not appear how and in what position the 
victim was when he was killed so that it cannot be said for certain that
 the accused had adopted a mode or means of attack tending directly to 
insure or facilitate the commission of the offense without risk to 
himself arising from the defense or retaliation which the victim might 
put up.
</p><p>
Pat. Nicandro Garcia of the Bulalacao police force merely declared that 
he was in his house, about 15 meters away from the municipal building 
when the accused Rudy Tiongson and his companions escaped from prison,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  and he did not see the accused shoot Pat. Gelera.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Police Chief Edwardo Borwangga did not also see the accused Rudy 
Tiongson shoot Pat. Gelera.  He declared that Pat. Gelera was already 
dead when he arrived at the municipal building in the afternoon of 
October 26, 1971. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
PC Sgt. Teotimo Saway, who led the pursuit of the escaped detainees, 
declared that he was in one of the stores in front of the Bulalacao 
municipal building, about 60 meters away, when he heard two (2) gunshots
 coming from the direction of the municipal building,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  and Pat. Gelera was already dead when he saw him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
The circumstances qualifying or aggravating the act of killing a human 
being must be proved in an evident and incontestable manner, mere 
presumptions or deductions from hypothetical facts not being sufficient 
to consider them justified.  Thus, in the case of <em>U.S. vs. Barbosa</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  the Court said that "since the case does not furnish any evidence to 
the effect that Barbosa had formed the deliberate, premeditated 
intention to take the life of his wife, and there was no eyewitness as 
to the manner in which the deceased was strangled; consequently there is
 no provision of law under which we can hold that the crime was 
committed with treachery, and it must be borne in mind that the 
qualifying circumstances of a crime in its commission, in order to be 
considered, must be established by competent evidence as well as the 
crime to which they relate."
</p><p>
In the case of <em>U.S. vs. Perdon</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  the Court said that since "neither this witness nor any other gives 
any particulars whatever as to the manner in which the aggression was 
made, nor how the act which resulted in the death of the deceased began 
and developed; and this being the case, it can not be established from 
mere suppositions, drawn from circumstances prior to the very moment of 
the aggression, that the accused had employed means tending to insure 
its success without any danger to his person, which constitutes 
treachery (<em>alevosia</em>) as defined by the Penal Code.  The 
circumstances specifying an offense or aggravating the penalty thereof 
must be proved as conclusively as the act itself, mere suppositions or 
presumptions being insufficient to establish their presence according to
 law.  No matter how truthful these suppositions or presumptions may 
seem, they must not and can not produce the effect of aggravating the 
condition of the defendant."
</p><p>
The Court, in <em>U.S. vs. Asilo</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  also ruled that since it was not established "that the aggressors 
employed any means which might have rendered all defenses impossible for
 the deceased, inasmuch as no one witnessed the very act of aggression, 
there is not sufficient ground to establish the conclusion that the 
attempt which deprived Anastacio Claridad of his life was made with 
treacery (<em>alevosia</em>).  The treachery can in no way be presumed, 
but must be fully proven in order to be apprecia­ted for the effects of 
the Penal Code."
</p><p>
In <em>People vs. Ramiscal,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  the Court rejected the claim that treachery was present because "at 
the time that the accused inflicted the wound upon the deceased there 
was not a single eyewitness, for when the witnesses Umali and Chua Chuan
 entered the store the wound had already been inflicted."
</p><p>
The Solicitor General also agreed with the defendant's counsel that 
treachery is not present in the killing of PC Constable Aurelio M. 
Canela since the deceased was actually warned by PC Sgt. Saway not to 
remain standing but seek cover because of the known presence of the 
accused in the vicinity, but that the said deceased dis­regarded the 
warning.  The pertinent portion of the testimony of PC Sgt. Saway reads,
 as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FISCAL SADICON: </p>
  <p>
    Q    Were you alone while you were pursuing those three escaping prisoners?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     No, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    Who was your companion if there was any?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     Pat. Nicandro Garcia, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    While you were pursuing these prisoners what happened next?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     When we were already along the mountain then watching for the 
appearance of the three escapees, I saw C2C Aurelio Canela, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    What does this C2C mean?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     Constable Second Class, sir.
  </p>
  <p> Q    After seeing C2C Aurelio Canela approach­ing while you were waiting for the three escapees what did you do? </p>
  <p>
    A     I signaled him to lie flat and indicated to him where the escapees seem to be moving, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    Then what did C2C Canela do upon your signal?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     He continued walking towards me and at that precise moment I 
signaled him again to lie down because the escapees-prisoners were 
there, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    After that what happened?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     He did not heed my instruction and because of that I 
approached him and tried to hold him instructing him to lie down but on 
that precise moment two shots were fired, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    From what direction those two shots came from?
  </p>
  <p>
    A     From my left approximately 4 meters away from me, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q    What happened after hearing those two shots?
  </p>
  <p> A     I saw Canela already hit and shouting <em>'aruy'</em> sir."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering that PC Constable Canela had been sufficiently forewarned of
 the presence of the appellant in the vicinity and that he was not 
completely deprived of an opportunity to prepare and repel or avoid the 
aggression, treachery cannot be appreciated.
</p><p>
Since treachery, which would qualify the killing of Pat. Gelera and PC 
Constable Canela to Murder, was not present, the crimes may only be 
punished as Homicide.  It may be true that a judicial confession of 
guilt admits all the material facts alleged in the information, 
including the aggravating circumstances listed therein, as stated by the
 trial judge, yet where there has been a hearing and such circumstances 
are disproven by the evidence, they should be disallowed in the 
judgment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    3. We also agree with the parties that the aggravating circumstances
 of (1) evident premeditation, (2) in contempt of or with insult to 
public authorities, (3) uninhabited place, and (4) abuse of superior 
strength were not present in the commission of the crimes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Evident premeditation must be ruled out in view of the absence of 
sufficient proof that a plan to kill the victims existed, the execution 
of which was preceded by deliberate thought and reflection.  Besides, 
with respect to the killing of PC Constable Canela, only ten minutes 
passed from the time the accused escaped from the Municipal Jail up to 
the time he shot PC Constable Canela near the cemetery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
 so that there was no lapse of time during which he could have 
deliberately planned the kill­ing of the said PC Constable and meditated
 on the conse­quences of his act. </p>
  <p>
    4. The aggravating circumstance that the crimes were committed in 
contempt of or with insult to the public authorities cannot also be 
appreciated since Pat. Gelera and PC Constable Canela were the very ones
 against whom the crime were committed.  Besides, Pat. Gelera and PC 
Constable Canela are not persons in authority, but merely agents of a 
person in authority.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p> 5. The lower court also found that the killing of PC Constable 
Canela was committed in an uninhabited place.  It has not been shown, 
however, that the offense was committed in an isolated place, far from 
human habitation.  In order that the aggravating circumstance of the 
commission of a crime in an uninhabited place may be considered, it is 
necessary that the place of occur­rence be where there are no houses at 
all, a considerable distance from the village or town, or where the 
houses are a great distance apart.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  Here, PC Sgt. Saway merely declared that the place where PC Constable 
Canela was shot was about 700 meters away from the Municipal Building of
 Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
  which does not satisfy the requirement.  Besides, the record does not 
show that the place was intentionally sought by the accused to 
facilitate the commission of the crime.  The accused was trying to evade
 his pursuers, PC Constable Canela among them, and their encounter was 
purely by chance.  The lower court, therefore, erred in finding that the
 crime was committed in an uninhabited place.
  </p>
  <p>
    6.  Finally, the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior 
strength must also be ruled out since there is no direct evidence that 
the accused employed superior strength in the killing of Pat. Gelera.  
The accused was then a detainee and was unarmed while Pat. Gelera had 
his service pistol with him.  With respect to PC Constable Canela, the 
accused was alone against three armed pursuers, namely:  PC Sgt. Saway, 
PC Constable Canela, and Pat. Nicandro Garcia and a civilian by the name
 of Fred Barcelona.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As heretofore stated, the accused is guilty only of the crime of 
Homicide in the killing of PC Constable Canela and Pat. Gelera.  The 
Solicitor General recommends that the accused should be sentenced to 
suffer imprisonment of from 8 years and 1 day to 14 years and 8 months, 
with the accessory penalties, for each homicide committed by him.  The 
penalty recommended is within the range provided by law.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, with the modification that the accused Rudy Tiongson should 
be sentenced to suffer imprisonment of from eight (8) years and one (1) 
day of <em>prision mayor</em>, as minimum, to fourteen (14) years and eight (8) months of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
 as maximum, for each homicide committed by him, the judgment appealed 
from should be, as it is hereby, AFFIRMED.  The indemnity to be paid to 
the heirs of the victims is hereby increased to P30,000.00 in each case.
