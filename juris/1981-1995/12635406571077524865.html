				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two decisions of the appellate court are involved in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first one was rendered by the
then Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="10">October 21,
 1981</st1:date> in an action for specific performance filed by the private
respondents against the St. Dominic Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second decision was promulgated by the
respondent Intermediate Appellate Court on <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1984</st1:date> in an action to set aside an order of the
Regional Trial Court directing receipt in consignation of the amount ordered to
be paid by the Court of Appeals in its 1981 decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition for review seeks to set aside the decision of the
Intermediate Appellate Court which dis­missed the petition filed by St. Dominic
Corporation after it held that the private respondents made a timely
consignation of the balance of the purchase price of the disputed lot which
originally belonged to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The facts of the case as
found by the Intermediate Appellate Court are stated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> B.
Acosta and Eva Acosta signed on February 27, 1967 a Land Purchase Agreement
wherein herein Petitioner St. Dominic Corporation sold to the former Lot No.
1-A, S-2, Block 8, covered by T.C.T. No. 842<span class="GramE">,00</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, for P15,400.00, P4,000.00 of which was paid
upon the execution of the contract and the remaining balance of P11,400.00 was
to be paid in 120 equal monthly installments of P150.75 a month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Stipulated in said contract are: "(1) that if such payments
shall continue in arrears for more than 60 days, or if the purchaser shall
violate the conditions therein, the entire balance shall at once be due and
demandable; (2) that in case the purchaser failed to comply with any of the
condition of the contracts and/or fails to pay any monthly installments or any
payments therein as agreed upon, the purchaser was granted a grace period which
shall not exceed 60 days to be counted from the time the condition breached
ought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to have been complied, otherwise,
the contract shall be automatically cancelled and res­cinded and of no force
and effect.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>From <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1967</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1969</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> made a total monthly payment of P2<span class="GramE">,458.25</span>, covering a period of 17 months, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> were,
however, about 7 months in arrears of the corresponding monthly payments due,
when they sent to the St. Dominic Corp. the amount of P300.00 in two separate
money orders on <st1:date year="1969" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These payments were rejected by the St.
Dominic Corporation in a letter sent to the <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span>
by its Corporate Secretary, expressing regret that said corporation could not
accept their (<span class="SpellE">Acostas</span>') payments, because their contract
had been cancelled on March 24, 1969; that as early as July 29, 1968, said
Corporate Secretary had sent to the Private Respondents herein a letter
informing the latter that their contract had been cancelled on July 15, 1968,
exactly one month after their final notice, and that postal money order Nos.
683713, 603930, 603939, sent by the <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> were sent
back to them.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As a consequence, Private
Respondents <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> instituted in the then Court of
First Instance of Manila an action against </span>the St. Dominic Corporation
to compel the latter to accept payment of the lot in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case was docketed as Civil Case No.
62370 of said Court, Branch VIII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later
a decision was rendered in said case adverse to the <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said decision it was decreed:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING, plaintiffs' complaint and defen­dant's
counterclaim are both ordered DISMISSED for lack of merit; the contract,
Exhibit 'E' is ordered cancelled and defendant is declared the owner of said
lot described in para­graph 2 of the plaintiff's complaint; and the
installments that plaintiffs have paid to defendant are declared 'rents paid
for the use and occupation of the aforementioned premises." (Pars. 7, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'E')." <span class="GramE">(Petition, par. 7).</span></p>

<blockquote>Dissatisfied with the above decision the <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span>
appealed the same to the then Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their appeal was docketed therein as CA-G.R. No. 55698-R.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1981</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, setting aside
the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby set aside and
a new one entered declaring that the contract Exhibit 'E' has not yet been
rescinded and ordering plaintiffs-appellants to pay the defendant corporation
within sixty (60) days from receipt hereof the remaining balance of the
contract in the total amount of P8<span class="GramE">,942.00</span> together
with interest thereon at 12% p.a. from April, 1968, the date of default,
attorney's fees in the sum of P3,000.00 and the costs of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon payment of same, the
defendant-corporation is ordered to execute in favor of the
plaintiffs-appellants the necessary deed of transfer to the
plaintiffs-appellants the title to the lot in question, free from all liens and
encumbrances except those provided for in the contract, all expenses which may
be incurred in said transfer of title to be paid by the
plaintiffs-appellants."</p>

<blockquote>On November 9, 1981, Plaintiffs-Appellants <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span>
filed with the Court of Appeals a "Manifestation and Motion for
Reconsideration" of the above decision which according to them, they
received on November 2, 1981 from their daughter who received the registered
letter con­taining said decision on October 30,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span>1981.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> Acosta alleged in
this pleading that he went to see the Corporate Secretary of the St. Dominic
Corporation, Atty. Lydia <span class="SpellE">Geraldez</span> and offered to pay
the balance of the purchase price of the land in question but the said Attorney
stated that she could do nothing with the Appellants' request; that upon verification
from the Office of the Register of Deed of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, Appellant <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> Acosta found out that the
lot in question had been already sold by Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
St. Dominic Corporation to one Angel N. <span class="SpellE">Panajon</span>, on
August 24, 1981, barely two months before the decision of the Court of Appeals
in this case was promulgated on October 23, 1981, and a corresponding Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 280087 dated August 24, 1981 had already been issued
in favor of this second buyer Angel N. <span class="SpellE">Panajon</span>, upon
payment by the latter to the Corporation the sum of P18,480.00; that TCT No.
125104 pre­viously registered in the name of St. Dominic Corporation, covering
the subject lot had been, therefore cancelled; that upon ocular inspection of
the lot in question, Appellant <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span> Acosta
saw, for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">first time, a </span>newly
erected resi­dential house that had been erected therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> therefore prayed that
the Court of Appeals, in the light of the matters above mentioned, reconsider
said portions of its decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner corporation, on the other hand, also sought
reconsideration of the appellate court's decision'</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the motions of the petitioner and the private respondents
were denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1982</st1:date>, the petitioner filed a second
motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">time, </span>it moved that a conference with
the private respondents be held in the hope of arriving at a happy resolution
of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner expressed
its desire to give as a replacement for the lot in question, another lot in the
same subdivision for the benefit of the respondents because it had already sold
the disputed lot in the ordinary course of business to a third person prior to
the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1982</st1:date>,
the appellate court denied the petitioner's motion but granted its request to
have a conference with the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court set the same on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="5">May
 28, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate
Court, however, emphasized the fact that such conference would not prejudice
the finality of the decision of the main case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The scheduled conference was postponed and re-set thrice by the
Intermediate Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1982</st1:date>, after the last
conference when the negotiations finally bogged down, the private respondent's
secured a copy of the entry of judgment of the appealed decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 30, 1982, the respondents filed a
motion for execution of judgment with Branch VII of the Court of First Instance
of Manila and on September 15, 1982 they filed their first motion for
consignation with the same court, depositing with the Clerk of Court the amount
of P27<span class="GramE">,800.17</span> which was the balance of the purchase
price of the questioned lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was ascertained later that the first motion for consignation
was not in the records and could not be found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the Clerk of Court directed the respondents to immediately file
another motion for consignation which the latter did on <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was furnished the petitioner but receipt
was not acknowledged.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1982</st1:date>,
the trial court, granted the respondents' motion for consignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the order
but it was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the petitioner
went to the appellate court and raised the following issues:</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing the petition filed by the petitioner, the
Intermediate Appellate Court held:</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals dated October 21, 1981 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">which </span>was received by Private
Respondents <span class="SpellE">Acostas</span> on October 30, 1981, as of that
date has yet no binding effect, there being no entry yet of the said
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus it has been held:</p>

<blockquote>"In a case decided by the court on appeal, <u>the true
judgment of legal effect is that entered by the clerk of said court</u>
pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of its decision, <u>and

years mentioned in Section 443 of the Code of Civil Procedure <u>must be

<blockquote>Indeed, Petitioner Corporation, through its counsel, knew all along
that said decision Of the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1981</st1:date> or even for a period thereafter, cannot
be deemed final or <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="GramE">corporation</span>
filed its Motion for Reconsideration of the stated decision on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the Court of Appeals for
lack of merit on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1982</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">As </span>regards the
validity of the respondents' consig­nation, the appellate court held that
"the amount they (respondents) are bound to pay under the Judgment to
Petitioner Corporation is not the same as the tender of payment of a
contractual debt and consignation of the money due from a debtor to a
creditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the requirements of

<p class="BODY">The merit of the above assigned errors are all anchored on the
first issue of whether or not the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">res</span>pondents
made a timely consignation as ordered by the Court of Appeals of the remaining
balance of the purchase price for the disputed lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by the petitioner that the 60-day period given by
the Court of Appeals should be reckoned from the receipt of the decision and
not from the date of entry of the judgment as found by the Intermediate
Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further
maintains that even if the 60-day period is to be reckoned from the finality of
the decision, still the consignation by the respondents was made out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the above contentions.</p>

<p class="BODY">First of all, the decision of the then Court of Appeals which was
promulgated on October 21, 1981, is quite clear when it ordered the payment of
the balance of the purchase price for the disputed lot within 60 days
"from receipt <u>hereof</u>," meaning from the receipt of the
decision by the respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an
admitted fact that the respondents received a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">copy </span>of the decision on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="10">October
 30, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, they had up
to <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1981</st1:date> to
make the payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon refusal by the
petitioner to receive such payment, the proper procedure was for the respondent
to consign the same with the court also within the 60-day period or within <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>reasonable time thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that efforts were made by the petitioner
to reach an agreement with the respondents after the promulgation of the
decision did not in anyway affect the finality of the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was clearly emphasized in the order of
the appellate court on <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, even if we reckon the 60-day period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from </span>the date of the finality of the
decision as interpreted by the appellate court, such finality should be counted
from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1982</st1:date>, which was the date the decision became
final as indicated in the entry of judgment and not from <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1982</st1:date> which is the date the entry was
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The date of a finality of a
decision is entirely distinct from the date of its entry and the delay in the
latter does not affect the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the former <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>such is counted from the expiration
of the period to appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We made this
clear in the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Pfleider</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span></u>
(98 SCRA 497) wherein we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>Clearly, the fifteen day period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">within which to </span>appeal to this Court a
judgment of the Court of Appeals commences either from notice of said judgment
or from notice of the denial of a motion for reconsidera­tion provided that
said motion for reconsideration has been "filed in due time".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the lapse of fifteen (15) days from
notice of <span class="SpellE">judge­ment</span>, the same becomes final and the
Court of Appeals loses jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the subsequent filing of a motion for
reconsideration cannot disturb the finality of the judgment nor restore
jurisdiction which had already been lost.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as also argued by the petitioner, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>now too late and legally impossible

explicit that 'every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a
decree of registration, and every subsequent purchaser of regis­tered land who
takes certificate of title for value in good faith shall hold the same free of
all encumbrance except those noted on said certificate, xxx."</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on
the correctness of the certificate of title issued there for and the law will in

the property."</p>

good faith, it is enough that he <span class="GramE">examine</span> the latest
certificate of title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Citing
