<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts, as culled from the pleadings, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Talisay-Silay</span>
Milling Co., Inc. (Central) is the owner and operator of a sugar mill located
in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, manufacturing centrifugal sugar from sugarcanes delivered to the
mill by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Lizares</span>,

C. <span class="SpellE">Rosello</span>, Enrique <span class="SpellE">Yusay</span>,
Domingo Rodriguez, Inc., and First Farmers' Milling Co., Inc. pursuant to
identical milling contracts executed between the former and the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the provisions of the milling
contracts, Central was granted, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, an
easement of aqueduct on the parcels of land owned by petitioners for the
passage of water from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Imbang</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> to its sugar mill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, Central constructed concrete
water canals traversing the parcels of land of petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The easement of aqueduct was for a period of
fifty (50) years, which began with 1920-21 crop year up to 1969-70 crop <span class="GramE">year</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Prior to the expiration of this period, Central, by means of
separate letters, offered to lease from petitioners the areas occupied by the
canals.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioners
refused to entertain the offer of Central.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1970</st1:date>,
Central filed its complaints against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span>

Inc. and First Farmers' Milling Co., Inc., docketed as Civil Cases Nos. 9472
and 9473, respectively, before the same court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In all these cases, Central prayed for the establishment of a legal
easement of aqueduct on the parcels of land owned by petitioners (same areas
presently occupied by the canals) and for the issuance of writs of preliminary
injunction <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> to restrain the
petitioners and/or their agents, representatives, assigns, successors-in-interest
from removing and/or destroying the canals or otherwise from obstructing the

considering the lengthy, oral and written arguments of the parties, pro and
con, the Court finds no sufficient ground to dissolve the writs of preliminary
injunction issued in the above-entitled cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The position of the defendants is that the injunctions were issued on
the premature assumption that, even after the expiration of the plaintiff's
contractual easement of aqueduct, it was entitled to a legal or compulsory
easement of aqueduct on the same location or route, even without averment of
the existence of the statutory requisites for the establishment of such legal
easement, citing the cases of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia Milling
Co., Inc. et al. vs. Capitol Subdivision, Inc., et al, 64 O.G. 1965; and Angela
Estate, Inc., et al vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental, et al. G.R. No. L-27084, July 31, 1968; while the plaintiff
maintains the following positions:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that the contractual easement of aqueduct has not expired <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">as </span>yet when the complaint was filed;
(2) that the complaint has sufficiently and with clarity averred that the
statutory requisites for easement of aqueduct exist, hence, the propriety and
legality of the issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction; and (3) that
the decisions of the Supreme Court in the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia
Co., Inc., cases aforesaid are not applicable to the issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">at </span>bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On January 27, 1988, considering the length of time that these

supervening events have rendered these cases moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether or not respondent court committed grave
abuse of discretion in having issued the orders dated June 30, 1970 and July
20, 1970 directing the issuance of the writs of preliminary injunction, the
order dated December 10, 1970, denying the motion to dissolve the writs of

order dated April 21, 1971 denying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>motion

<p class="BODY">The petitioners have failed to show grave abuse of discretion on
the part of respondent court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>issuing
the questioned orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that the cases of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>-Murcia

constitute the leading jurisprudence in the issuance of the writs of
preliminary injunction in cases of complaints praying for the declaration of
legal easement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In answer thereto,
Central asserts that the aforementioned decisions are inapplicable in these
cases because they refer to legal easement of right of way.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases invoked by petitioners may be applied to this
controversy only insofar as the general principles on the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction reiterated therein are concerned, but not with regard to
the other principles enunciated therein because they deal with legal easement
of right of way whereas <span class="GramE">Our</span> concern here is legal
easement of aqueduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">A preliminary injunction may be granted at any time after the
commencement of the action and before judgment, when it is established that the
plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded, and the whole or part of such
relief consists in restraining the commission or continuance of the acts
complained of, or in the performance of an act or acts, either for a limited
period or perpetually; that the commission or continuance of some act
complained of during the litigation or the non-performance thereof would
probably work injustice to the plaintiff; or that the defendant is doing,
threatens, or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act
probably in violation of the plaintiff's rights respecting the subject of the
action, and tending to render the judgment ineffectual.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The purpose of this provisional remedy is to preserve the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">status quo</span></u><a style="mso-footnote-id:

and/or the relation between the parties, in order to protect the right of the
plaintiff respecting the subject of the action during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because, otherwise or if no
preliminary prohibitory injunction were issued, the defendant may, before final
judgment, do or continue the doing of the act which the plaintiff asks the
court to restrain, and thus make ineffectual the final judgment rendered
afterwards granting the relief sought by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In praying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>the
issuance of the w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ri</span>ts of
preliminary injunction, Central averred the following in its complaints (pp.
57-136, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>):<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>should the
defendants (petitioners herein) remove or demolish the concrete water canals or
otherwise interfere with the easement of aqueduct which has been availed of by
it for the last fifty (50) years through the use of said canals by obstructing,
impeding or preventing the passage of water thereon, irreparable damage would
be caused <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to </span>it, as they all
together have a yearly quota to fill including the export quota which
constitutes part of the commitment of the Republic of the Philippines to the
United States; that during the crop year 1969-70, Central manufactured
871,797.50 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of centrifugal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">sugar </span>of which manufactured sugar sixty
(60%) percent thereof or 523,078,500.00 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> more
or less are export or "A" sugar shipped to the United States to fill
part of the aforesaid yearly quota, which at the price of P40.00 a <span class="SpellE">picul</span> on the average, amount to P208,231,400.00, or
$34,871,900.00 thereby availing to the Government of the Republic of the
Philippines much needed dollars to bolster the depleted foreign exchange
reserve of the country which at the present time is dangerously low; that in
fact no damage has resulted or will result to the defendants (petitioners
herein) from the continued use and exercise of the easement of aqueduct while
on the other hand, irreparable damage will be caused to Central, the other
planters affected and even to the sugar industry and the national economy as a
whole, unless it be allowed the continuous use of the canals and its continued
use thereof be legally recognized as a legal easement of aqueduct upon payment
to defendants (petitioners herein) of a reasonable compensation to be fixed by
the court, the said legal easement to exist for a period coterminous with the
existence and operation of the mill; and that unless the defendants
(petitioners herein) are restrained from committing the act of either impeding
or in any way obstructing the passage of water from the <span class="SpellE">Imbang</span>
River through the canals presently existing on their properties by destroying
said canals or otherwise, which defendants (petitioners herein) are threatening
to do, Central's mill operation will be completely paralyzed resulting in great
and irreparable loss and damage to it and its planters.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent court that Central has sufficiently
established the necessity of issuing writs of preliminary injunction against
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend next that assuming crop year 1969-70 ended
only on <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1970</st1:date>, by
the time respondent court issued its <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1970</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="4">April 21,
 1971</st1:date> orders, Central's contractual right to the easement of
aqueduct has already expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, Central avers that since the writs of preliminary injunction were
issued before the expiration of the contractual easement of aqueduct, they were
issued not only to protect an existing right then, but even after August 31,
1970, to preserve the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">status </span>quo
</u>between the parties, pending judicial determination as to whether or not it
(Central) could convert its existing contractual easement of aqueduct into a
legal easement under Arts. <span class="GramE">642-643 of the New Civil Code.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It frequently happens that, pending suits for injunctive relief, changes
take place in the conditions which give rise to the litigation, and the
question is thus presented whether the suit should stand or fall upon the facts
as they existed at the time it was brought, so as to exclude all consideration
of subsequent changes or abandonment of the acts complained of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Generally speaking, it is the condition of
things at the time of the hearing of the suit which is material, and which
furnishes the basis for relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
court is not only authorized, but it is its duty to determine not merely
whether the plaintiff was entitled to an injunction at the time he began the
suit but whether the facts as they appear at the time of the hearing warrant
such relief, and it may refuse to grant an injunction where, since the
commencement of the suit, conditions have so changed as to render an injunction
useless and of no effect if granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Injunctive relief will generally be refused where, before the final
hearing, the plaintiff loses his interest in or title to the subject matter
sought to be protected, or where the act sought to be restrained has been made
lawful by statute or ordinance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
does not mean, however, that the court should deny injunctive relief in every
case of material changes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>conditions
or abandonment of the acts complained of, for circumstances may still exist
which, in the face of such a situation, would justify the issuance of
injunction as a matter of sound judicial discretion (28 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>.
201, cited in The Revised Rules of Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in
</span>the Philippines by Vicente J. Francisco, 1985 Edition, p. 178).</p>

<p class="BODY">In these cases, the writs of preliminary injunction were issued
(as correctly averred by Central) not only to protect the existing easement of
aqueduct in its favor, but even after the end of 1969-70 crop year, to preserve
the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">status </span>quo</u> between
the parties, pending judicial determination as to whether or not Central can
convert its contractual easement of aqueduct into a legal easement of
aqueduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the writs of preliminary
injunction were to be dissolved, the probability of the canals' destruction or
obstruction by petitioners would be great, considering that they refused the
offer made by Central to lease the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">areas
</span>covered by the canals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
event that respondent court grants Central a legal easement of aqueduct, this
judgment might be rendered ineffectual by the destruction or obstruction of the
canals.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised by
petitioners inasmuch as they dwell on the merits of the case pending before
respondent court.</p>
