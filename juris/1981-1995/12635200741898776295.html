				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal under Republic Act No. 5440 from the lower
court's order, dismissing <span class="SpellE">Ninfa</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> complaint because of her nonappearance at the
hearing, a failure which she attributes to her <u>counsel's</u> alleged mis­understanding
of the date thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1979, <span class="SpellE">Ninfa</span> <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental Civil Case No. 6512 to annul the
extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage on her Lot No. 1051-C covered by OCT
No. 0-166 located at <span class="SpellE">Lapasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City with an area of 989 square meters valued
at P40,320.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgage had been executed in her behalf by <span class="SpellE">Ismaela</span> B. Alvaro, her attorney-in-fact (lessee of the
lot), in favor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, to secure a loan of P120<span class="GramE">,000</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cua</span> had sued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
20.0pt">in </span>1977 the spouses <span class="SpellE">Ismaela</span> B. Alvaro
and Felipe Alvaro in Civil Case No. 5538 (p. 70, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).
Its <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> was annotated by means of a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">lis</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>on the back of OCT-166. The bank's
new title is TCT No. 29323 (supposed to be Annex 6 of the bank's comment but
Annex 6 is OCT No. 0-166 and not TCT No. T-29323.) Presumably, the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">pendens</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>is
also annotated on TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-29323).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the issues<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>had
been joined in Civil Case No. 6512 and the pre-trial was held on <st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1979">October 31, 1979</st1:date>, the case was set
for hearing on <st1:date month="2" day="8" year="1980">February 8, 1980</st1:date>.
Apparently, no trial was held on that date. The case was again set for trial on
<st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1980">July 29, 1980</st1:date> but "for
lack of material time" the hearing was transferred to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"</span><st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">September 5, 1980</span></u></st1:date><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> at </span></u><st1:time hour="9" minute="0"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">9:00 o'clock</span></u></st1:time><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> in the morning</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">". </span>A copy of this order was
received by Monica <span class="SpellE">Jardin</span>, the wife of <span class="SpellE">Galdino</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Jardin</span>, counsel of
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> (p. 131, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel alleges in paragraph 9 of
the instant petition that the real reason why no hearing was held on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1980</st1:date> was because of the
absence of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Maderazo</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> counsel for the
Alvaro spouses, and not because of "lack of material time".</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Cua</u></span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and
her counsel did not appear</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>The
lower court dismissed the complaint and defendants' counterclaims (p. 47, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> and her counsel
thought that the hearing was scheduled on <st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1980"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Sep</span>tember 8</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">, </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">1980</span></u></st1:date><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
and not September 5</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The version of <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel is that he
was in the office of the clerk of court at about <st1:time hour="11" minute="0">eleven
 o'clock</st1:time> of <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5,
 1980</st1:date> to file Civil Case No. 7341. On that occasion, the court
interpreter informed him that <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">Civil </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Case No. 6512</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>was dismissed for nonappearance of <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> and her counsel. At about <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">two
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of that same day, he talked with the Pre­siding
Judge to explain his nonappearance. He thought that the case was scheduled on <st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1980"><u>September 8, 1980</u></st1:date> as he had
indicated in his diary book (p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel received on <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5, 1980</st1:date> a copy of the order of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel alleged that a certain
stenographer named <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Salceda</span>
was the one who took down the notes of the hearing on <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1980">July 29, 1980</st1:date> which he and the two opposing
lawyers signed. But, contrary to the usual practice, the stenographic notes of <span class="SpellE">Salceda</span> and the minutes of the hearing on that date <u>were
not attached to the record of the case</u>. <span class="SpellE">Salceda</span>
and the deputy clerk of court could not explain why the minutes of the hearing
were not in the record. <u>They are now attached to the lower court's record on
page 57-A</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cua</span> filed a motion for reconsideration
of the order of dismissal. It was denied by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> in his order of
October 7, 1980 on the grounds that the bases of the motion "are
deliberate falsehoods" and that <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel
filed at three o'clock in the afternoon of September 5, 1980 an "urgent
motion for transfer of hearing" accompanied by a medical certifi­cate as
to <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> "pretended illness" so that
plaintiff and her counsel could have an excuse for not coming to court in the
morning of September 5, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> concluded his dismissal
order with the observation that <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> had admitted the
execution of the special power of attorney to accommodate the Alvaro spouses
and, therefore, she "<u>has no meritorious cause of action and there is no
point in granting the motion for reconsideration. It would be an exercise in
futility to reinstate the complaint only to dismiss it again because it lacks a
meritorious cause of action</u>." <span class="GramE">(pp. 62-63, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the bank is that a copy of the
court order transferring the trial to <u>September 5, 1980</u> was actually
received by <span class="SpellE">Jardin's</span> wife (Annexes 7 and 8 of
Comment). So, there was no reason for him to insist that the trial was scheduled
on <st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1980"><u>Se</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">p</span>tembe</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">r 8, 1980</span></u></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>And at <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">three
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of the same day, <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5, 1980</st1:date>, he filed a motion for
transfer of the September 8 hearing because of <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span>
illness (Annex 10 of Comment). That was a "diversionary strategy"
according to the bank's counsel inconsistent with the allegation of <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span> counsel that he learned of the dismissal at <st1:time hour="11" minute="0">eleven o'clock</st1:time> and with his conference with the
Presiding Judge at <st1:time hour="14" minute="0">two o'clock</st1:time>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank's counsel attached to his comment a copy of the
stenographic notes and the minutes of the hearing for <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1980">July 29, 1980</st1:date> (p. 57-A, Record), and the
affidavit of the deputy clerk of court to refute <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span>
allegations that the case was set for <st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1980"><u>September
 8, 1980</u></st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that in the interest of justice Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Cua</span>
should not be prejudiced by her counsel's failure to appear at the hearing of <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5, 1980</st1:date>. Such failure was
sufficiently explained by her counsel. Moreover, Judge <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>
had shown in his order of <st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1980">October 7,
 1980</st1:date> <u>that he had prejudged the case</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 6512, <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> vs. Bank of
the P. I., should be consolidated with the related case of Civil Case No. 5538,
"<span class="SpellE">Ninfa</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ismaela</span> B. Alvaro, et al.," which is now pending
before Branch 17 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental, presided by Hon. Judge Cesar <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Rosete's</span> order
of dismissal dated <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1980">September 5, 1980</st1:date>
in Civil Case No. 6512 is reversed and set aside. That case should be
consolidated with Civil Case No. 5538 and transferred to Judge <span class="SpellE">Ybañez</span>. No costs.</p>
