				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appeal by <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>
upon his conviction by the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>
in Criminal Case No. 1024 for the crime of murder qualified by treachery. He
was sentenced "to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with the
accessories of the law; to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> in the amount of
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; and to pay one-third of the costs."
His co-accused, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Latorre</span> were acquitted
on ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's evidence shows that about <st1:time hour="16" minute="0">4:00</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1975">September 24, 1975</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> was walking along the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">street </span>in <span class="SpellE">Patong</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Estaka</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>. Following him, about seven meters away,
was his sister, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orral</span>, age 42. When <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
was about ten meters away from the house of appellant <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>, the latter, who was at the window of his
house, fired a shot at <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> who sustained wounds
on his face, neck and face, caused by pellets (small shot leads used in
shotgun), two of which found its exit at the back causing ruptures of his <span class="SpellE">innominate</span> artery and apex of the right lung. (Exhibit
"F")</p>

<p class="BODY">The shooting was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Orral</span> who also saw Miguel <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Latorre</span>
standing near the appellant at the time. Thereafter, the assailant, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Latorre</span> jumped out of the house and ran towards the
seashore.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balasbas</span>, a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Councilman, was at the seashore at the time and, upon hearing the shot,
immediately rushed towards the place. He saw <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> near the basketball court, about to fall. He
ran towards <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> and inquired who shot him. <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> answered, "Tome <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>
was carried to a motor boat to be transported to the hospital but, on the way,
he died.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense is alibi. He claims that at about <st1:time hour="9" minute="0">9:00</st1:time> that morning of <st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1975">September 24, 1975</st1:date> he was at the seashore of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Estaka</span> <span class="SpellE">Buri</span> waiting for transÂ­portation to Mercedes, <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span> to attend the town fiesta. He was not able to
get water transportation but was able to take a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
arriving at the house of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">one </span><span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> at about <st1:time hour="11" minute="0">11:00</st1:time> in the morning. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">He </span>stayed in the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> the
whole day and left the place late afternoon. He then passed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the house </span>of
one <span class="SpellE">Loloy</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> who
invited him to drink, after which he visited <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>. After having drunk three bottles of beer,
a man with a gun came and asked: "Are you Miguel <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>?
And I told him, no, I am Tome, <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>, I am not Miguel. I have a brother Miguel but I
do not know where he is now. He is under medical treatment." (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp.
231-232, <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1981</st1:date>
hearing) Thereafter, the man brought him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">outside
</span>the house and then to the stockade at <span class="SpellE">Maulong</span>
where he was maltreated and suspected of having killed <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Coming </span>to this
Court, appellant claims that the lower court "erred in giving credence to
the testimonies of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the prosecution </span>witnesses
which were biased, improbable and contrary to the physical facts; and, in
convicting" him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that the eye-witness, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orral</span>, a sister of
the victim, would not have seen appellant and his companions inside the house
through an opening because she noticed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">place only </span>after the shot was fired and "it was highly
improbable for her to see who among the three fired the shotgun <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> that only one (1) shot
was fired which caused the death of her brother <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>, which should have been fired at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">an </span>angle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to </span>the right of the victim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> and that these were contradicted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Berbietta</span> <span class="SpellE">Macopia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pilpa</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span></span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> who
testified that the injuries sustained by the victim were the result of two
gunshots, and that the assailant was in front of the victim." (pp. 2-3,
appellant's brief). Further, appellant claims that considering the injuries
sustained by the victim it was improbable for him to have still talked, <span class="SpellE">muchless</span> seen who among the three fired the shotgun.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded. There was <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span> <span class="SpellE">Orral</span> who positively
identified herein appellant as the one who shot her brother. She testified
thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">The relationship of <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> with the
victim does not discredit her testimony. Well settled is the rule that when
there is no showing of improper motive on the part of witnesses for testifying
against the accused, the fact that they are related to the victim does not
render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of full faith and credit.
"On the contrary, their natural interest in securing the conviction of the
guilty would deter them from implicating persons other then the culprits, for,
otherwise, the latter would thereby gain immunity" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, et al., 33 SCRA 812).</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the relative position between assailant and the

<p class="BODY">The statement made by the victim, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Niedo</span>, pointing to appellant as the one who fired the
shot partakes of the nature of a dying declaration because when he made it his
hope <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>survival was very slim,
as in fact, he died minutes after the incident. And, as to whether he could
still talk after he was fired at, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pilpa</span>
categorically answered in the affirmative.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said here in this autopsy report

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="GramE">We</span> take note of the observation
and finding of the trial court that appellant went into hiding after the
incident:</p>

<blockquote>"There, too, are circumstances extant in the evidence that
this defendant <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span>
tried to elude the police authorities after the incident. The <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony of Barrio councilman Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balasbas</span> shows that when he (<span class="SpellE">Balasbas</span>)
with Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span> and two other PC soldiers whom he and
his wife fetched from the Constabulary camp in <span class="SpellE">Maulong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, went to
the house of this accused in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Estaka</span> a few hours
after the shooting incident, the wife informed them that the accused was no
longer there as he had already gone to <span class="SpellE">Luyo</span> (other
side of Bo. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Estaka</span></span><span class="GramE">).</span> They took a motorboat and went to the place indicated -
to the house of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Patro</span> - but <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no </span>longer there either. So the PC
soldiers just asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>be
brought back to camp. Again, there is the <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>
testimony of Constable Raul Luna to the effect that when he went to the house
of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> the
day after the incident, the owner upon his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">inquiry </span>told him that the accused was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not </span>there. But when the sister-in-law of the victim who accomÂ­panied
him went upstairs, he heard a commotion in the house and when he went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">up, </span>two persons jumped out of the
window; but he found accused <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> <span class="SpellE">Jabeguero</span> who locked himself inside a toilet and who
attempted to escape. This conduct is certainly incompatible with this <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> innocence." (pp. 3-4, Decision in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 1024)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing evidence of the prosecution adds to appellant's
guilt beyond reasonable doubt and negates <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his
alibi, </span>a defense that is easy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
</span>fabricate. His flight from the scene of the crime is a form of admission
by conduct which gives rise to the inference that he committed it (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Molleda</span>, <span class="GramE">86 SCRA 667</span>).</p>
