				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These four cases have been consolidated because they involve
practically the same parties and related issues arising from the same incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in G.R. Nos. 93177 and 96948 and the private
respondents in G.R. Nos. 95020 and 97454 are officers of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines facing prosecution for their alleged participation in the
failed <u>coup d’ <span class="SpellE">etat</span></u> that took place on
December 1 to 9, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charges against them are violation of Articles of War (AW) 67
(Mutiny), AW 96 (Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and a Gentleman) and AW 94
(Various Crimes) in relation to Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code (Murder).</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>G.R. No. 93177, which is
a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, prohibition and <i><u>mandamus</u></i>,
they are questioning the conduct of the Pre-Trial Investigation (PTI) Panel
constituted to investigate the charges against them and the creation of the
General Court Martial (GCM) convened to try them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 96948, the petitioners, besides challenging the
legality of GCM No. 14, seek <i><u>certiorari</u></i> against its ruling
denying them the right to peremptory challenge as granted by Article 18 of Com.
Act No. 408.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 95020, the orders of the respondent judge of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City are assailed on <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
on the ground that he has no jurisdiction over GCM No. 14 and no authority
either to set aside its ruling denying bail to the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 97454, <i><u>certiorari</u></i> is also sought
against the decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City in a petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> directing the release of the
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdictional
objections are likewise raised as in G.R. No. 95020.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the charges were referred to GCM No. 14, a Pre-Trial
Investigation (PTI) Panel had been constituted pursuant to Office Order No. 16
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1990</st1:date>, to
investigate the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 93177 and 96948.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PTI Panel issued a uniform subpoena dated <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1990</st1:date>, individually
addressed to the petitioners, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>You are hereby directed to appear in person before the undersigned
Pre-Trial Investigating Officers on <u>12 Feb 90 9:00 a.m.</u> at <span class="SpellE"><u>Kiangan</u></span><u> Hall, Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span></u>
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, then, and there to submit your
counter-affidavit and the affidavits of your witnesses, if any, in the
pre-trial investigation of the charge/charges against you for viol of <span class="SpellE">Aws</span> _________ DO NOT SUBMIT A MOTION TO DISMISS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Failure to submit the aforementioned counter-affidavits on the date
above specified shall be deemed a waiver of your right to submit <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the petitioners acknowledged receipt of a copy
of the charge sheet, sworn statements of witnesses, and death and medical
certificates of victims of the rebellion.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the first scheduled hearing, the petitioners challenged the
proceedings on various grounds, prompting the PTI Panel to grant them 10 days
within which to file their objections in writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done through a Motion for Summary
Dismissal dated <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1990</st1:date>, the PTI Panel denied the motion and gave the petitioners
5 days from notice to submit their respective counter-affidavits and the
affidavits of their witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1990</st1:date>,
the petitioners verbally moved for reconsideration of the foregoing denial and
the PTI Panel gave <span class="GramE">them</span> 7 days within which to reduce
their motion to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done
on <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners now claim that there was no pre-trial
investigation of the charges as mandated by Article of War 71, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 71.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Charges; Action
upon</u>. - Charges and specifications must be signed by a person subject to military
law, and under the oath either that he has personal knowledge of, or has
investigated, the matters set forth therein and that the same are true in fact,
to the best of his knowledge and belief.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>No charge will be referred to a general court-martial for trial
until after a thorough and impartial investigation thereof shall have been
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This investigation will include
inquiries as to the truth of the matter set forth in said charges, form of
charges, and what disposition of the case should be made in the interest of
justice and discipline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At such
investigation full opportunity shall be given to the accused to cross-examine
witnesses against him if they are available and to present anything he may
desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation, and the
investigating officer shall examine available witnesses requested by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the charges are forwarded
after such investigation, they shall be accompanied by a statement of the
substance of the testimony taken on both sides</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">They also allege that the initial hearing of the charges
consisted merely of a roll call and that no prosecution witnesses were
presented to reaffirm their affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the motion for summary dismissal was denied, the motion for reconsideration
remains unresolved to date and they have not been able to submit their
counter-affidavits.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1990</st1:date>, the petitioners in G.R. No. 96948 manifested that they
were exercising their right to raise peremptory challenges against the
president and members of GCM No. 14.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They invoked Article 18 of Com. Act No. 408 for this purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GCM No. 14 ruled, however, that peremptory
challenges had been discontinued under P.D. No. 39.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 95020, <span class="SpellE">Ltc</span>. Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Ligot</span> applied for bail on <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1990</st1:date>, but the application was denied by GCM No.
14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thereupon filed with the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
and <i><u>mandamus</u></i> with prayer for provisional liberty and a writ of
preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After considering
the petition and the answer thereto filed by the president and members of GCM
No. 14, Judge <span class="SpellE">Maximiano</span> C. Asuncion issued an order
granting provisional liberty to <span class="SpellE">Ligot</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1990</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Ligot</span> filed an urgent omnibus motion to enforce the
order for his release and to declare in contempt the commanding officer of the
PC/INP Jail for disobeying the said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He later also complained that Generals De Villa and Aguirre had refused
to release him “pending final resolution of the appeal to be taken” to this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the trial court reiterated its order for the
provisional liberty of <span class="SpellE">Ligot</span>, as well as of <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Ltc</span>. Franklin <span class="SpellE">Brawner</span>, Lt/Col. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> and Maj. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>,
and later of additional <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> <span class="SpellE">Ltc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Romelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Gojo</span>
and Capt. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1990</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered judgment <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span><u>:</u></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Declaring that Section 13, Article III of
the Constitution granting the right to bail to all persons with the defined
exception is applicable and covers all military men facing court-martial
proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the assailed
orders of General Court-Martial No. 14 denying bail to petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> on the mistaken assumption that bail does not
apply to military men facing court-martial proceedings on the ground that there
is no precedent, are hereby set aside and declared null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent General Court-Martial No. 14 is
hereby directed to conduct proceedings on the applications of bail of the
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> and which may as well include
other persons facing charges before General Court-Martial No. 14.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pending the proceedings on the applications for bail before General
Court-Martial No. 14, this Court reiterates its orders of release on the
provisional liberty of petitioner Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Ligot</span> as
well as <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> Franklin <span class="SpellE">Brawner</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1991</st1:date>,
the private respondents in G.R. No. 97454 filed with this Court a petition for <u>habeas</u>
<u>corpus</u> on the ground that they were being detained in <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
without charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was
referred to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
where it was raffled to respondent Judge Antonio P. Solano.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding after hearing that no formal charges
had been filed against the petitioners after more than a year after their
arrest, the trial court ordered their release.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has examined the records of this case and rules as
follows.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 93177 and 96948 were
given several opportunities to present their side at the pre-trial
investigation, first at the scheduled hearing of <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1990</st1:date>, and then again after the denial of
their motion of <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1990</st1:date>,
when they were given until <st1:date year="1990" day="7" month="3">March 7,
 1990</st1:date>, to submit their counter-affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, they filed instead a verbal
motion for reconsideration which they were again asked to submit in
writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This they did on <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was in effect denied when the PTI
Panel resolved to recommend that the charges be referred to the General Court
Martial for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said petitioners cannot now claim they have been denied due
process because the investigation was resolved against them owing to their own
failure to submit their counter-affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had been expressly warned in the <u>subpoena</u> sent them that
“failure to submit the aforementioned counter-affidavits on the date above
specified shall be deemed a waiver of (their) right to submit <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence.” They chose not to heed the
warning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As their motions appeared to be
dilatory, the PTI Panel was justified in referring the charges to GCM No. 14
without waiting for the petitioners to submit their defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due process is satisfied as long as the party is accorded an
opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is not
availed of, it is deemed waived or forfeited without violation of the Bill of
Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was in our view substantial compliance with Article of War
71 by the PTI Panel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is now
settled that “even a failure to conduct a pre-trial investigation does not
deprive a general court-martial of jurisdiction.” We so held in <span class="SpellE">Arula</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>But even a failure to conduct a pre-trial investigation does not
deprive a general court-martial of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The better accepted concept of pre-trial investigation is that it
is directory, not mandatory, and in no way affects the jurisdiction of a
court-martial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Humphrey v. Smith, 336
<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> 695, 93 L <span class="GramE">ed</span> 986 (1949), the Court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“We do not think that the pre-trial investigation procedure by
Article 70 (The Philippine counter-part is article of war 71, Commonwealth Act
408) can properly be construed as an indispensable pre-requisite to the
exercise of Army general court-martial jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Article does serve important functions in
the administration of court-martial procedures and does provide safeguards to
an accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its language is clearly such
that a defendant could object to trial in the absence of the required
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that event the
court-martial could itself postpone trial pending the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the military reviewing authorities could
consider the same contention, reversing a court-martial conviction where
failure to comply with Article 70 has substantially injured an accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we are not persuaded that Congress
intended to make otherwise valid court-martial judgments wholly void because
pre-trial investigations fall short of the standards prescribed by Article
70.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Congress has not required
analogous pre-trial procedure for Navy court-martial is an indication that the
investigatory plan was not intended to be exalted to the jurisdictional level.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.4in;" align="center">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x</p>

<p class="2Q">Shortly after enactment of Article 70 in 1920 the Judge Advocate
General of the Army did hold that where there had been no pre-trial
investigation, court?martial proceedings were void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But this holding has been expressly repudiated in later holdings of the
Judge Advocate General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This later
interpretation has been that the pre-trial requirements of Article 70 are
directory, not mandatory, and in no way affect the jurisdiction of a
court-martial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The War Department’s
interpretation was pointedly called to the attention of Congress in 1947 after
which Congress amended Article 70 but left unchanged the language here under
consideration.”</p>

<blockquote>A trial before a general court-martial convened without any pre-trial
investigation under article of war 71 would of course be altogether irregular;
but the court-martial might nevertheless have jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, this rule is similar to the
one obtaining in criminal procedure in the civil courts to the effect that
absence of preliminary investigation does not go into the jurisdiction of the
court but merely to the regularity of the proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to what law should govern the conduct of the preliminary
investigation, that issue was resolved more than two years ago in <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span> v. De Villa,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where we declared:</p>

<blockquote>The Court finds that, contrary to the contention of petitioners,
there was substantial compliance with the requirements of law as provided in the
Articles of War and P.D. No. 77, as amended by P.D. No. 911.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amended charge sheets, charging
petitioners and their co-respondents with mutiny and conduct unbecoming an
officer, were signed by Maj. Antonio Ruiz, a person subject to military law, after
he had investigated the matter through an evaluation of the pertinent records,
including the reports of respondent AFP Board of Officers, and was convinced of
the truth of the testimonies on record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The charge sheets were sworn to by Maj. Ruiz, the “accuser,” in
accordance with and in the manner provided under Art. <span class="GramE">71 of
the Articles of War.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that P.D. No. 77, as amended by P.D. No. 911, is only of <span class="SpellE">suppletory</span>
application, the fact that the charge sheets were not certified in the manner
provided under said decrees, i.e., that the officer administering the oath has
personally examined the affiant and that he is satisfied that they voluntarily
executed and understood his affidavit, does not invalidate said charge sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a “pre-trial investigation” was
conducted by respondent Maj. <span class="SpellE">Baldonado</span>, wherein,
pursuant to P.D. No. 77, as amended by P.D. No. 911, petitioners were
subpoenaed and required to file their counter-affidavits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of doing so, they filed an
untitled pleading seeking the dismissal of the charges against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioners were not able to confront
the witnesses against them was their own doing, for they never even asked Maj. <span class="SpellE">Baldonado</span> to subpoena said witnesses so that they may be
made to answer <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> questions in accordance
with P.D. No. 77, as amended by P.D. No. 911.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also allege that GCM No. 14 has not been
constituted in accordance with Article 8 of the Articles of War because General
Order No. M-6, which supposedly convened the body, was not signed by Gen. <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> de Villa as Chief of Staff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article of War No. 8 reads:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>General
Courts-Martial</u>. - The President of the Philippines, the Chief of Staff of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the Chief of Constabulary and, when
empowered by the President, the commanding officer of a major command or task
force, the commanding officer of a division, the commanding officer of a
military area, the superintendent of the Military Academy, the commanding
officer of a separate brigade or body of troops may appoint general
courts-martial; but when any such commander is the accuser or the prosecutor of
the person or persons to be tried, the court shall be appointed by superior
competent authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that General Order No. M-6 was not signed by
Gen. De Villa, there is no doubt that he authorized it because the order itself
said it was issued “By Command of General De Villa” and it has not been shown
to be spurious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by the
Solicitor General, the Summary Disposition Form showed that Gen. De Villa, as
Chief of Staff, AFP, actually constituted GCM No. 14 and appointed its
president and members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is significant
that General De Villa has not <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> or
revoked or in any way disowned the said order, as he would certainly have done
if his authority had been improperly invoked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, as the principal respondent in G.R. No. 93177, he
sustained General Order No. M-6 in the Comment filed for him and the other
respondents by the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the right to peremptory challenge, we note that
this was originally provided for under Article 18 of Com. Act No. 408 (Articles
of War), as amended by Rep. Act No. 242, on <st1:date year="1948" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1948</st1:date>, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Challenges</u>.
- Members of general or special courts-martial may be challenged by the accused
or the trial judge advocate for cause stated to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court shall determine the relevancy and
validity thereof, and shall not receive a challenge to more than one member at
a time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Challenges by the trial judge
advocate shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused
are offered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each side shall be entitled
to the peremptory challenge, but the law member of the court shall not be
challenged except for cause.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The history of peremptory challenge was traced in <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span> v. Alejandro,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>In the early formative years of the infant Philippine Army, after
the passage in 1935 of Commonwealth Act No. 1 (otherwise known as the National
Defense Act), except for handful of Philippine Scout officers and graduates of
the United States military and naval academies who were on duty with the
Philippine Army, there was a complete dearth of officers learned in military
law, this aside from the fact that the officer corps of the developing army was
numerically inadequate for the demands of the strictly military aspects of the
national defense program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of
these considerations it was then felt that peremptory challenges should not in
the meanwhile be permitted and that only challenges for cause, in any number,
would be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Article 18 of the
Articles of War (Commonwealth Act No. 408), as worded on <st1:date year="1938" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1938</st1:date>, the date of the approval of
the Act, made no mention or <span class="GramE">reference</span> to any
peremptory challenge by either the trial judge advocate of a court-martial or
by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <st1:date year="1958" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1958</st1:date>, when the Manual
for Courts-Martial of the Philippine Army became effective, the Judge Advocate
General’s Service of the Philippine Army conducted a continuing and intensive
program of training and education in military law, encompassing the length and
breadth of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This program was pursued until the outbreak
of World War II in the Pacific on <st1:date year="1941" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1941</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the formal
surrender of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the allies in 1945, the officer corps of the Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had expanded to a very large number, and a great many of the officers had been
indoctrinated in military law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in
these environmental circumstances that Article of War 18 was amended on <st1:date year="1948" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1948</st1:date> to entitle “each side”
to one peremptory challenge, with the sole proviso that “the law member of
court shall not be challenged except for cause.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1972</st1:date>,
President Marcos issued General Order No. 8, empowering the Chief of Staff of
the Armed Forces to create military tribunals “to try and decide cases of
military personnel and such other cases as may be referred to them.”</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1972</st1:date>,
he promulgated P.D. No. 39 (Governing the Creation, Composition, Jurisdiction, Procedure,
and other matters relevant to Military Tribunals).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decree disallowed the peremptory
challenge, thus:</p>

<blockquote>No peremptory challenge shall be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Challenges for cause may be entertained to
insure impartiality and good faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Challenges shall immediately be heard and determined by a majority of
the members excluding the challenged member.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A tie vote does not disqualify the challenged member.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A successfully challenged member shall be
immediately replaced.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1978</st1:date>,
President Marcos promulgated P.D. No. 1498, or the National Security Code,
which was a compilation and codification of decrees, general orders, LOI and
policies intended “to meet the continuing threats to the existence, security
and stability of the State.” The modified rule on challenges under P.D. No. 39
was embodied in this decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1981</st1:date>,
President Marcos issued Proc. No. 2045 proclaiming the termination of the state
of martial law throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation revoked General Order No. 8
and declared the dissolution of the military tribunals created pursuant thereto
upon final determination of the cases pending therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">P.D. No. 39 was issued to implement General Order No. 8 and the
other general orders mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the termination of martial law and the dissolution of the military
tribunals created <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, the reason for the
existence of P.D. No. 39 ceased automatically.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic canon of statutory construction that when the
reason of the law ceases, the law itself ceases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Cessante</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ratione</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>, <span class="SpellE"><u>cessat</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
principle is also expressed in the maxim <u>ratio</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>est</u></span></span> <u>anima</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the reason of law is its soul.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying these rules, we hold that the withdrawal of the right to
peremptory challenge in P.D. No. 39 became ineffective when the apparatus of
martial law was dismantled with the issuance of Proclamation No. 2045.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the old rule embodied in Article
18 of Com. Act No. 408 was automatically revived and now again allows the right
to peremptory challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the respondents in G.R. No. 96948 that the
right to peremptory challenge remains withdrawn under P.D. No. 39.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat for emphasis, this decree was
itself withdrawn when martial law was lifted on <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, even if not so withdrawn, it could still be considered no longer
operative, having been cast out under the new dispensation as, in the words of
the Freedom Constitution, one of the “iniquitous vestiges of the previous regime.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The military tribunal was one of the most oppressive instruments
of martial law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is curious that the
present government should invoke the rules of that discredited body to justify
its action against the accused officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court realizes that the recognition of the right to
peremptory challenge may be exploited by a respondent in a court-martial trial
to delay the proceedings and defer his deserved punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hoped that the accused officers in the cases
at bar will not be so motivated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, the wisdom of Com. Act No. 408, in the light of present circumstances, is
a matter addressed to the law-makers and not to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judiciary can only interpret and apply
the laws without regard to its own misgivings on their adverse effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a problem only the political
departments can resolve.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in G.R.
Nos. 95020 and 97454 question the propriety of the petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
and <i><u>mandamus</u></i> and the petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
filed by the private respondents with the Regional Trial Courts of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
argued that since the private respondents are officers of the Armed Forces
accused of violations of the Articles of War, the respondent courts have no
authority to order their release and otherwise interfere with the court-martial
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners further contend that under Sec. 9 (3) of BP 129,
the Court of Appeals is vested with “exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all
final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders, or awards of Regional Trial
Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions.”
Rather irrelevantly, the petitioners also cite the case of Yang v. Court of
Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court held that “appeals from the Professional Regulation Commission
are now exclusively cognizable by the Court of Appeals.”</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
provision and the case cited refer to ordinary appeals and not to the remedies
employed by the accused officers before the respondent courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Martelino</span>, we observed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>It is true that civil courts as a rule exercise no supervision or
correcting power over the proceedings of courts-martial, and <span class="GramE">that
mere errors</span> in their proceedings are not open to consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The single inquiry, the test, is
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is equally true
that in the exercise of their undoubted discretion, courts-martial may commit
such an abuse of discretion - what in the language of Rule 65 is referred to as
“grave abuse of discretion” - as to give rise to a defect in their jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the point at issue in this
action suggested by its nature as one for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> and
prohibition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Trial Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the
Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court over petitions for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
prohibition or <i><u>mandamus</u></i> against inferior courts and other bodies
and on petitions for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> and <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of a law providing that the decisions, orders and ruling of a
court-martial or the Office of the Chief of Staff can be questioned only before
the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, we hold that the Regional Trial
Court can exercise similar jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the right to bail invoked by the private respondents
in G.R. Nos. 95020 has traditionally not been recognized and is not available
in the military, as an exception to the general rule embodied in the Bill of
Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This much was suggested in <span class="SpellE">Arula</span>, where we observed that “the right to a speedy trial
is given more emphasis in the military where the right to bail does not exist.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The justification<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for this
exception was well explained by the Solicitor General as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The unique structure of the military should be enough reason to
exempt military men from the constitutional coverage on the right to bail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Aside from structural peculiarity, it is vital to note that
mutinous soldiers operate within the framework of democratic system, are
allowed the fiduciary use of firearms by the government for the discharge of
their duties and responsibilities and are paid out of revenues collected from
the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other insurgent elements
carry out their activities outside of and against the existing political
system.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>National security considerations should also impress upon this
Honorable Court that release on bail of respondents constitutes a damaging
precedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Imagine a scenario of say
1,000 <span class="SpellE">putschists</span> roaming the streets of the
Metropolis on bail, or if the assailed <st1:date year="1990" day="25" month="7">July
 25, 1990</st1:date> Order were sustained, on “provisional” bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sheer number alone is already
discomforting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, the truly
disquieting thought is that they could freely resume their heinous activity
which could very well result in the overthrow of duly constituted authorities,
including this Honorable Court, and replace the same with a system consonant
with their own concept of government and justice.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The argument that denial from the military of the right to bail
would violate the equal protection clause is not acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This guaranty requires equal treatment only
of persons or <span class="GramE">things similarly situated and does</span> not
apply where the subject of the treatment is substantially different from
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused officers can
complain if they are denied bail and other members of the military are not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they cannot say they have been discriminated
against because they are not allowed the same right that is extended to
civilians.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contention of the private respondents in G.R. No. 97454
that they had not been charged after more than one year from their arrest, our
finding is that there was substantial compliance with the requirements of due
process and the right to a speedy trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u> was directly filed
with this Court on <st1:date year="1991" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1991</st1:date>,
and was referred to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City for raffle, hearing and decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was heard on <st1:date year="1991" day="26" month="2">February 26,
 1991</st1:date>, by the respondent court, where the petitioners submitted the
charge memorandum and specifications against the private respondents dated <st1:date year="1991" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1991" day="12" month="2">February
 12, 1991</st1:date>, pursuant to Office Order No. 31-91, the PTI panel was
created and initial investigation was scheduled on <st1:date year="1991" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1991</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00
 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1991" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1991</st1:date>, the private respondents received
the copies of the charges, charge sheets and specifications and were required
to submit their counter-affidavits on or before <st1:date year="1991" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was indeed a delay of more than one year in the investigation and
preparation of the charges against the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this was explained by the Solicitor
General thus:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The AFP
Special Investigating Committee was able to complete its pre-charge
investigation only after one (1) year because hundreds of officers and
thousands of enlisted men were involved in the failed coup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them, as well as other witnesses, had
to be interviewed or investigated, and these inevitably took months to
finish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-charge investigation was
rendered doubly difficult by the fact that those involved were dispersed and
scattered throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In some cases, command units, such as the
Scout Rangers, have already been disbanded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the charges were completed, the same still had to pass review and
approval by the AFP Chief of Staff.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While accepting this explanation, the Court nevertheless must
reiterate the following admonition:</p>

<blockquote>This Court as protector of the rights of the people, must stress
the point that if the participation of petitioner in several <u>coup</u>
attempts for which he is confined on orders of Adjutant General Jorge <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span> cannot be established and no charges can be filed
against him or the existence of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case warranting
trial before a military commission is wanting, it behooves respondent then
Major General Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Biazon</span> (now General) to release
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents must also be
reminded that even if a military officer is arrested pursuant to Article 70 of
then Articles of War, indefinite confinement is not sanctioned, as Article 71
thereof mandates that immediate steps must be taken to try the person accused
or to dismiss the charge and release him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any officer who is responsible for unnecessary delay investigating or
carrying the case to a final conclusion may even be punished as a court martial
may direct.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted, finally, that after the decision was rendered
by Judge Solano on <st1:date year="1991" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1991</st1:date>,
the government filed a notice of appeal <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>cautelam</u></span>
and a motion for reconsideration, the latter was ultimately denied, after
hearing, on <st1:date year="1991" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 48-hour period for appeal under Rule 41,
Section 18, of the Rules of Court did not run until after notice of such denial
was received by the petitioners on <st1:date year="1991" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the
private respondents’ contention, therefore, the decision had not yet become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> when the special civil action in
G.R. No. 97454 was filed with this Court on <st1:date year="1991" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1991</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the propriety of the petitions at bar, it is well to
reiterate the following observations of the Court in <span class="SpellE">Arula</span>:</p>

<blockquote>The referral of charges to a court-martial involves the exercise of
judgment and discretion (AW 71).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, in order to prosper, must be based on
jurisdictional grounds because, as long as the respondent acted with
jurisdiction, any error committed by him or it in the exercise thereof will
amount to nothing more than an error of judgment which may be reviewed or
corrected only by appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even an abuse
of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the issuance of a writ of <i><u>certiorari</u></i>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As in that case, we find that the respondents in G.R. No. 93177
have not acted with grave abuse of discretion or without or in excess of
jurisdiction to justify the intervention of the Court and the reversal of the
acts complained of by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such action is indicated, however, in G.R. No. 96948, where we find that
the right to peremptory challenge should not have been denied, and in G.R. Nos.
95020 and 97454, where the private respondents should not have been ordered
released.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, in G.R. No. 93177, the petition is DISMISSED
for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 96948,
the petition is GRANTED, and the respondents are DIRECTED to allow the
petitioners to exercise the right of peremptory challenge under Article 18 of
the Articles of War.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. Nos. 95020
and 97454, the petitions are also GRANTED, and the orders of the respondent
courts for the release of the private respondents are hereby REVERSED and SET
ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">SARMIENTO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the <b>ponencia</b> of my esteemed colleague, Mr.
Justice Cruz, but I dissent insofar as he would deny bail to accused military
personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution explicitly grants the right to bail to "all
persons" before conviction, with the only exception of "those charged
with offenses punishable by <b>reclusion perpetua</b> when evidence of guilt is
strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The Charter also states that "[T]he right to bail shall not be impaired
even if the writ of <b>habeas corpus</b> is suspended."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
To deny the military officers here concerned of the right to bail is to
circumscribe the inclusive meaning of "all persons"--the coverage of
the right.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that military officers fall within "persons".</p>

<p class="BODY">The picture conjured up by the Solicitor General of "a
scenario of say 1,000 putschists roaming the streets of the Metropolis on bail,
or <span style="">if </span>the assailed July 25, 1990
Order were sustained, on 'provisional' bail…[t]he sheer number alone <span style="">is </span>already discomforting...[b]ut, the
truly disquieting thought <span style="">is </span>that
they could freely resume their heinous activity which could very well result in
the overthrow of duly constituted authorities, including this Honorable Court,
and replace the <span style="">same with </span>a
system consonant with their own concept of government and justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
But would a scenario of 1,000 murderers or drug pushers roaming the streets of
the metropolis justify a denial of the right to bail?  Would not that dark picture painted by the solicitor General be
reproduced by 1,000 "equally dangerous" elements of society?</p>

<p class="BODY">We gave bail Senator Enrile and General Brawner.  I find no <span style="">reason why </span>the petitioners should not be granted the same right.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority would point to tradition, supposed to be firmly
settled, <span style="">as </span>an argument to deny
bail.  I submit, however, that tradition
is no <span style="">argument.  </span>First, the Constitution does not say
it.  Second, we are a government of
laws, not tradition.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there are <span style="">precedents
that </span>attest to the contrary, I submit that a reexamination is in <span style="">order.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
