Intermediate Appellate Court which reversed the resolution of the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span> Commission in PGC Case No. 22 and set aside the
order for the issuance in favor of the petitioner of a mayor's permit to
operate a cockpit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Roderico</span> <span class="SpellE">Deang</span>
is the owner of a cockpit known as "<st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Amusement</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>"

since 1945.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the time he bought the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">cockpit, the petitioner was annually granted
a license to operate the same until 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1979, <span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span> Consolidated
Incorporated, a cockpit operator in San Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
filed with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
Civil Case No. 5256 questioning the continued operation of several cockpits,
including the Angeles Amusement Center, on the ground of their improper
locations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The City of <st1:city><st1:place>Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>,
through then Mayor Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span>, intervened by
joining with the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1979</st1:date>, however, the
parties filed a joint motion to dismiss which reads as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"COME NOW plaintiff, defendant Angeles Amusement Center,
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, herein represented by their
counsels of record, to this Honorable Court respectfully move that the
complaint be dismissed, the counterclaim filed by the defendant Angeles
Amusement Center be dismissed, and the intervention of the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> be dismissed with prejudice insofar as the
plaintiff's complaint and defendant's counterclaim are concerned, but without
prejudice insofar as the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> future cause of
action is concerned against the defendant, without <span class="GramE">pronouncement</span>
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to costs." (p. 62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">December
 6, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the motion
was granted and the case was ordered dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the cockpit resumed its operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1981, when the petitioner applied for the renewal of the
cockpit's permit to operate, the city's new mayor, Mr. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, refused to grant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">it on the ground of improper location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, the cockpit is
located near two schools, a church, and a public building, contrary to
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mayor also found that the
cockpit encroaches on a public street known as </span><st1:street><st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">C. Pineda Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, therefore, went to the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span> Commission (PGC) in a petition for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="2">February
 1, 1983</st1:date>, the PGC found that the cockpit's location did not violate
zoning regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, however, ruled
that it had no jurisdiction to pass upon the issue of encroachment on a public
street as this issue properly pertains to the regular courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Resolving the petition, the PGC ordered the
respondent mayor to issue the necessary permit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The respondent then went
on appeal to the then Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1985, the Intermediate Appellate Court reversed the
resolution of the PGC and dismissed the petition on the ground that the
petitioner has not shown that his cockpit is legally occupying the portion of
C. Pineda Street on which it is located.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellate court ruled that "[I]f petitioner-[<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>] wants to question the respondent's-[appellant's]
determination in this regard, he must seek relief from the courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the Commission cannot
pre-empt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the jurisdiction of the
regular courts by ordering the Mayor to issue the permit." (p. 32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner filed a
motion for reconsideration and contended that the issue of encroachment is now </span><span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
between the parties as this was resolved <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>Civil Case No. 5256 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Mabuhay</span>
Consolidated, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Inc. </span>v. Angeles
Amusement Center, Inc., et al." He further alleged that the portion of the
street occupied by the cockpit is no longer public property because an
equivalent area of the lot on the opposite side of the street was exchanged for
it by <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1985</st1:date>,
the appellate court denied the motion for reconsideration for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It held that the dismissal order
issued in Civil Case No. 5256 clearly states that it is "without prejudice
insofar as the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> (City of <st1:city><st1:place>Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>)
future cause of action is concerned against the defendant (<st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Amusement</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>)"
(pp. 34-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As to the alleged property exchange, the appellate court ruled that the
"assertion must be substantiated by evidence to be presented in a
full-blown hearing originated in the lower courts." <span class="GramE">(Ibid).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> filed by the
petitioner on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner assails the appellate court's reversal of the PGC
resolution and propounds the issue of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> which allegedly results from the dismissal
order issued in Civil Case No. 5256.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
contends that the dismissal order which states that it is "without
prejudice insofar as the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> future cause of
action is concerned x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
20.0pt">" </span>refers to causes of action which may arise between them
after the issuance of the order and not to the causes of action, such as
improper location and encroachment on a public street, which have already been
resolved in the aforesaid case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner's
contentions have no merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has repeatedly held that for a judgment to be a bar to
a subsequent case, the following requisites must concur:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) it must be a final judgment; (2) the
court which rendered it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the
parties; (3) it must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be
identity between the two cases, as to parties, subject matter and cause of
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bringas</span>
v. Hernando, 144 SCRA 346, 359, citing the cases of Martinez v. Court of
Appeals, 139 SCRA 558; <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, 133 SCRA 344; <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
North Express, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, 126 SCRA 526; and <span class="SpellE">Gatus</span> v. Court of Appeals, 95 SCRA 530).</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the trial court did not rule on the merits
of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A judgment on the merits is
one rendered after a determination of which party is right, as distinguished
from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or formal or merely technical
point (Santos v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 145 SCRA 238, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">245-246).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no evidence that a trial was conducted in Civil Case No.
5256.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the records show
that the court, after considering the joint motion to dismiss submitted by the
parties, merely refrained from proceeding with the case and granted the motion
with some clarifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not find
merit in the petitioner's contention that the issue of encroachment is not a
future cause of action which arises after the issuance of the court order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's occupation of a public
street is continuous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause </span>of
action, therefore, subsists as long as the street is occupied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be a showing that the portion of
Pineda Street on which the cockpit is located was validly withdrawn from use as
a public street and that the alleged exchange of a lot on the street's opposite
side for the occupied portion was likewise legally consummated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">There is another reason
why we uphold the appellate </span>court's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>Philippine</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Gamefowl</u></span> <u>Commission</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Intermediate</u>
<u>Appellate</u> <u>Court </u>(146 SCRA 294) the Court compared and made clear
the powers vested in the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span>
Commission <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the powers of the city and
municipal officials under the applicable laws, namely, P.D. 1802, P.D. 1802-A
and the Local Government Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
Court held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"A study of the above-cited powers shows that it is the
municipal mayor with the authorization of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> that has the primary power to issue licenses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for the operation of ordinary cockpits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the regulation of cockpits is vested in
the municipal officials, subject only to the guidelines laid down by the
Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span> Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its power to license is limited only <span class="GramE">to</span> <u>international</u> derbies and does not extend to
ordinary cockpits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Over the latter kind
of cockpits, it has the power not of control but only of review and
supervision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"We have consistently held that supervision means 'overseeing
or the power or authority of an officer to see that their subordinate officers
perform their duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the latter fail
or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or steps as
prescribed by law to make them perform their duties.' Supervision is a lesser
power than control, which connotes 'the power of the officer to alter or modify
or set aside what a subordinate had done in the performance of his duties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.'
Review on the other hand, is a reconsideration or re-examination for purposes
of correction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"As thus defined, the power of supervision does not allow the
supervisor to annul the acts of the subordinate, for that comes under the power
of control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What it can do only is to
see to it that the subordinate performs his duties in accordance with law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The power of review is exercised to determine
whether it is necessary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to correct the
acts of the subordinate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">correction is necessary, it must be done by the authority exercising
control over the subordinate </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">through the instrumentality of the courts of
justice, unless the subordinate </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motu</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">corrects <span class="GramE">himself</span>
after his error is called to his attention by the official exercising the power
of supervision and review over him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"At that, even the
power of review vested in the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span>
Commission by P.D. 1802-A may have been modified by the Local Government Code,
which became effective on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">February </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">14, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Under
the Code, the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>
is supposed to examine the ordinances, resolutions and executive orders issued
by the municipal government and to annul the same, but only on one ground, to
wit, that it is beyond the powers of the municipality or </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ultra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>Significantly, no similar authority is conferred in such categorical
terms on the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Gamefowl</span> Commission regarding
the licensing and regulation of cockpits by the municipal government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"At any rate, assuming that the resolution of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> authorizing the

to reversal by the PGC, such action could be justified only if based upon a
proven violation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">law </span>by the
