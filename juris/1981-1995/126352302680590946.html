A Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari</em> of the decision of the Civil Service Commission upholding that of the Merit Systems Board in its MSB Case No. 50.
<p>
In the Regional Health Offices of the Ministry of Health, there are 
positions of Supervising Dentist and Senior Dentist, the former being of
 higher rank.  Sometime in 1977, the position of Supervising Dentist in 
Regional Health Office No. 4, Manila, became vacant.  At that time, 
petitioner TADURAN was the Supervising Dentist of Regional Health Office
 (RHO) No. 9, Zamboanga City, while private respondent GODINEZ was 
Senior Dentist of Regional Health Office (RHO) No. 4, Manila.
</p><p>
On February 23, 1977, the Secretary of Health (now Minister of Health) 
appointed TADURAN as Supervising Dentist of RHO No. 4.  It was a 
"transfer from a similar position in Regional Health Office No. 9, 
without alteration in salary".  On March 7, 1977, GODINEZ protested 
TADURAN's ap­pointment before the Civil Service Commission on the ground
 that as Senior Dentist in RHO No. 4, promotion was hers of right since 
she was the next-in-rank to Supervising Dentist.
</p><p>
It is admitted that GODINEZ has an edge over TADURAN in terms of 
educational attainment as she has a Certificate in Public Health, which 
TADURAN does not possess.  However, the appointing authority considered 
the fact that TADURAN outranks GODINEZ in points of experience, rank and
 salary.  TADURAN had been a World Health Organization Fellow; had 
conducted Dental Epidemiological Survey in Singapore for 3 months, and 
had an extensive supervisory field work expe­rience compared to the 
experience of GODINEZ in field work supervision, which had started only 
on October 25, 1976.
</p><p>
The issue for resolution is whether, under the new Civil Service Decree 
(P.D. No. 807), the promotion of a Senior Dentist to a vacant position 
of Supervising Dentist in the same region has priority over the transfer
 to the vacant position of one who is already a Supervising Dentist in 
another region.  Respondent Civil Service Commission upheld the Decision
 of its Merit Systems Board finding no justification for the appointment
 of TADURAN, a transferee, despite the availability of a next-in-rank 
employee in the same region in the person of GODINEZ.  It declared the 
ap­pointment by the Secretary (now Minister) of Health null and void, 
directed TADURAN's return to his former station, and recommended the 
promotion of GODINEZ to the contested position.
</p><p>
We are constrained to reverse.
</p><p>
The pertinent provisions of P.D. No. 807 read:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "See. 19 - Recruitment and Selection of Employees. </p>

competent, quali­fied and with the appropriate civil service eligibility
 <em>shall be considered for promotion.</em> </p>

  <p>
    (5) <em> If the vacancy is not filled by promotion</em> as provided herein <em>the same shall be filled by transfer</em>
 of present employees in the government service, by reinstatement, by 
re-employment of persons separated through reduction in force, or by 
appointment of persons with the civil service eligibility appropriate to
 the positions.
  </p>
  <p align="center">

  <p>
    (6) <em> A qualified next-in-rank employee shall have the right to appeal</em> initially to the department head and finally to the Office of the President <em>an appointment made</em> (1) in favor of another next-in-rank employee who is not qualified, or (2) in favor of one who is not next-in-rank, or (3) <em>in favor of one who is appointed by transfer and not next-in-rank</em>,
 or by reinstatement, or by original appointment if the employee making 
the appeal is not satisfied with the written special reason or reasons 
given by the appointing authority for such appointment.  x x x (Emphasis
 ours)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no mandatory nor peremptory requirement in the foregoing 
provision that persons next-in-rank are entitled to preference in 
appointment.  What it does provide is that they would be among the first
 to be considered for the va­cancy if qualified, and if the vacancy is 
not filled by promotion, the same shall be filled by transfer or other 
modes of appointment.  The latter provision is identical to that in 
Section 23 of Republic Act No. 2260.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
The noticeable change introduced by Section 19(6) of P.D. No. 807 lies 
in that a qualified next-in-rank employee shall have the right to appeal
 an appointment in favor of one who is appointed by transfer and not 
next-in-rank if the employee making the appeal is not satisfied with the
 written special reason or reasons given by the appointing authority for
 such appointment.  In other words, "special reason or reasons" are now 
required to be given even in case of an appointment by transfer and not 
next-in-rank.  However, the right of appeal wanted to the next-in-rank 
who has not been promoted, cannot be construed as indicative of a 
legislative intent to give priority to promotion over transfer as a 
means of filling vacant positions.  Such restrictive interpretation 
would unjustifiably imply that next-in ranks are more fit and 
meritorious for appointment than these of higher rank moved by transfer.
  It would also impose a rigid formula on the appointing power contrary 
to the policy of the law that among those qualified and eligible, an 
appointing authority is granted discretion and prerogative of choice of 
the one he deems most fit for appointment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  The cardinal requirement is merit and fitness under Article XII, B, 
Section 2, of the 1973 Constitution, and the demands of public service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It would seem fairly obvious then that the law does not impose a 
rigid or mechanistic formula on the ap­pointing power, compliance with 
which is inexorable and a deviation therefrom fatal.  Far from it.  If 
there be adhe­rence to the concept that public office is a public trust,
 as there ought to be, the criterion should be what public welfare 
demands, what satisfies public interest.  For it is axiomatic that 
public needs could best be attended to by officials about whose 
competency and ability there is no question.  To that overmastering 
requirement, personal ambition must of necessity yield.  Discretion, if 
not ple­nary, at least sufficient, should thus be granted to those 
entrusted with the responsibility of administering the offices 
concerned, primarily the department heads.  They are in the most 
favorable position to determine who can best fulfill the functions of 
the office thus vacated.  Unless, therefore, the law speaks in the most 
mandatory and peremptory tone, considering all the circumstances, there 
should be, as there has been, full recognition of the wide scope of such
 discretionary authority.  Happily, there is nothing in the Civil 
Service Act, which is fit­tingly concerned with protecting the rights of
 those in the career service that, rightly construed, calls for a 
different conclusion.  It is well worth repeating that the broad 
authority of a department head appears undisputable.  Such is the policy
 of the law, a policy reflected with fidelity in the decisions of this 
Court.  x x x "<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We thus see no reason for disturbing the Minister of Health's 
appointment of TADURAN in the exercise of his admi­nistrative or 
executive judgment.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, we reverse and set aside the appealed Decision of the Merit 
Systems Board, which was sustained by respondent Civil Service 
Commission and, instead, uphold the appointment of petitioner Dr. 
Napoleon A. Taduran as Supervising Dentist of Regional Health Office No.
 4-A, Manila.  The Temporary Restraining Order heretofore issued is 
hereby made permanent.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Relova,</em> and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p><em> Gutierrez, Jr., J.</em>, concur.  However reserves his views
 on the extent of the change introduce by Section 19, Subsections 2 to 
6, P. D. 807 on the Pineda v. Claudio doctrine when transfers or other 
modes re used instead of next-in-rank promotion.
