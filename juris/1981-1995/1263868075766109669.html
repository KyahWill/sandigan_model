				G.R. No. 97929, December 17, 1991</h4>
				<H3>BENJAMIN DY, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF
APPEALS, BIENVENIDO MANALO AND PARAMOUNT DEVELOPMENT BANK, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The original controversy was between the private respondents
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was complicated when the
petitioner herein entered the picture as intervenor and claimed ownership of
the properties in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">These properties were two lots located in Pandan, Angeles City,
each consisting of 180 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are designated <span style="">as </span>Lots 2 and 3 of Block 8 of the subdivision plan (LRC) Psd
31467.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on June 30, 1983, Bienvenido Manalo purchased Lot
2 for P9,000.00 from Paramount Development Bank, the herein other private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank expressly warranted
valid title to and peaceful possession of the property and that it was free
from all liens and encumbrances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August
1, 1983, the Deed of Absolute Sale<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
was duly registered and TCT No. 61529 in the Registry of Deeds of Angeles City
was issued in the name of Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on June 30, 1983, Manalo and Paramount entered into another
agreement pursuant to which the latter committed itself to sell Lot 3 to Manalo
for the sum of P9,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P3,000.00 was
to be paid in advance and the balance in specified installments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Contract to <span style="">Sell</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
stipulated that the mortgagor of Lot 3 having defaulted, Paramount would
institute foreclosure proceedings and allow Manalo to take possession of the
lot upon its purchase thereof at the auction sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank also agreed to execute <span style="">a </span>Deed of
Absolute Sale once it acquired title to the lot and upon full payment of the
balance by Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manalo alleges that when he went to occupy the said lots pursuant
to the above-mentioned contracts, he found that <span style="">they </span>had been fenced by Benjamin Dy, who claimed to be the owner
of the properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manalo then demanded
from Paramount that it eject Dy pursuant to its express warranty under the Deed
of Absolute Sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also informed the
bank that he would suspend the amortizations on Lot 3 until the land was
cleared of all occupants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank having failed to comply with Manalo's demand, the latter
filed <span style="">a </span>complaint
against it in the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Manalo demanded that the defendant make good
its warranty under the Deed of Absolute Sale, eject the occupants of Lot 3, and
execute a Deed of Absolute Sale thereof upon his full payment of the agreed
purchase price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also demanded actual,
moral and exemplary damages as well as litigation expenses, including
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, the defendant denied the claims of the plaintiff
and set up special and affirmative defenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Enter now the petitioner, as plaintiff-intervenor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benjamin Dy averred that the real owner of Lots 2 and 3 was he
and none other, having purchased them on February 2, 1972, from his father, Dy
Hong, for P14,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dy Hong had
acquired these lots from the Doña Agripina Subdivision on September 4, 1964, as
evidenced by two receipts issued to him by the seller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The intervenor claimed he had been in
possession of the lots since 1964 and that both Manalo and the bank knew he was
the owner of these properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, Judge Cesar V. Alejandria rendered judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
in favor of Manalo, to whom <span style="">Dy </span>was
ordered to surrender the subject lots.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendant bank was required to execute in Manalo's favor a Deed of
Absolute Sale over Lot 3 if or once it had already acquired title thereto, upon
payment by Manalo of the purchase price in full.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant was also sentenced to pay the
plaintiff damages in the amount of P10<span style="">,000.00
</span>and attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00, plus the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that the defendant was bound to place
plaintiff in peaceful possession of Lot 2 <span style="">in </span>accordance with the express warranty in
the Deed of Absolute Sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding Lot 3, the decision held that the plaintiff had the
right to suspend payment of the balance of the purchase price because the
conditions of the contract violated Art. 1461 of the Civil Code, and especially
since the land was occupied by Dy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
added that unless the bank could transfer <span style="">title
</span>and peaceful possession of the lot to Manalo, as promised, it should
refund the P3,000.00 advance payment, with interest, and pay Manalo damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Dy, the trial court said that his evidence of ownership
was insufficient, consisting as it did only of the two receipts and the deed of
sale from his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No deed of sale
from the Doña Agripina Subdivision was submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale signed by his father, who
supposedly acquired the land from the subdivision, was by itself alone a
"worthless document." There was no proof either that the disputed
lots belonged to the subdivision as the evidence of record showed that the land
<span style="">was </span>originally owned by one
Eusebio Lopez, who mortgaged it to Paramount.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant <span style="">and </span>the
intervenor both appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed
it <u>in</u> <u><span style="">toto</span></u> on
April 10, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The intervenor then filed this petition for review with this Court on the
following submissions:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The RTC erred in assuming jurisdiction over
the case as only the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board has the authority<span style=""> and exclusive jurisdiction over the case due
to the nature of the action.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without the approval of the HLURB, the
mortgage of the subdivision lots in favor of the Bank is void and any
subsequent transfer to other persons, including the Bank and Manalo, is
likewise null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mortgage of the subdivision lots to the
Bank or its predecessor-in-interest by the owner is null and void pursuant to a
decision of the Court dated November 11, 1981, involving the Fatima Subdivision
and Philippine Savings Bank, because a bank should know that when the property
was mortgaged to it, lots had been sold or were being sold to the public, and
should the company fail to liquidate the loan, the lot buyers would be
affected.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is the owner of the two
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1358 does not state that
the sale is void and non-existing just because the sale was not done in a
public instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirements of
said article are intended only to insure enforcement of the contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manalo was in bad faith when he purchased
the lots from the Bank because he knew that petitioner had already purchased
the lots from the subdivision.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by the petitioner that the nature of the action
places it under the jurisdiction of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board,
conformably to PD 957 as amended by PD 1344, providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 1. In the exercise of its function to regulate the real
estate trade and business and in addition to its powers provided <span style="">for in Presidential Decree No. 957, the
National Housing Authority shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide
cases of the following nature:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unsound real estate business practices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Claims involving refund and other claims
filed by subdivision, lot or condominium buyer against the project owner,
developer, dealer, broker or salesman; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>C.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cases involving specific performance of contractual
and statutory obligations filed by buyers of subdivision, lot or condominium
unit against the owner, developer, dealer, broker or salesman.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Exclusive jurisdiction over these cases was originally vested in
the National Housing Authority but was transferred by EO 648 dated February 7,
1981, to the Human Settlements Regulatory Commission, which was renamed Housing
and Land Use Regulatory Board by EO 90 on December 17, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provision clearly shows that the petitioner's
contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No.
4209 was an action for specific performance brought by Manalo as vendee of the
lots to enforce the warranty contained in the Deed of Absolute Sale and to
compel performance of the Contract to Sell by Paramount as vendor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank sold Lot 2 as mortgagee-owner after
having acquired title thereto by virtue of a foreclosure sale and promised to
sell Lot 3 under certain conditions in its capacity as mortgagee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not acting as a subdivision owner,
developer, broker or salesman, nor was it engaged in the real estate business
when it entered into the two contracts with Manalo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, PD 957 as amended is not
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is applicable is
Section 19 of BP 129, which vests in the Regional Trial Courts exclusive
original jurisdiction over civil actions involving title to or possession of
real property or any interest therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be added that the attack on the jurisdiction of the trial
court was made by the petitioner for the first time only when the case was
already in the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Tijam v. Sibonghanoy,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said that "we frown upon the ‘undesirable practice’ of a party
submitting his case for decision and then accepting the judgment only if
favorable, and attacking it for lack of jurisdiction, when adverse."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>his second and
third assignments of error, the petitioner alleges that the mortgages
constituted over the lots in favor of the bank are null and void for lack of
approval by the National Housing Authority pursuant to Section 18 of PD 957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also invokes the decision of the Court in
a case "involving the Fatima Subdivision and the Philippine Savings
Bank" but does not give any citation <span style="">of
</span>that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument is that
if the mortgages in favor of the bank are void, then the foreclosure sales and
the subsequent transfers of the lots are likewise void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18 of PD 957 provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Mortgages</u>
- No mortgage on any unit or lot shall be made by the owner or developer
without prior written approval of the authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such approval shall not be granted unless it
is shown that the proceeds of the mortgage loan shall be used for the
development of the condominium or subdivision project and effective measures
have been provided to ensure <span style="">such
utilization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan value of each lot </span><span style="">or unit </span><span style="">covered by the mortgage shall be determined and the buyer thereof, if
any, shall be notified before the release of the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buyer may, at his option, pay his
installment for the lot or unit directly to the mortgagee who shall apply the
payments to the corresponding mortgage indebtedness secured by the particular
lot or unit being paid for, with a view to enabling </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">buyer to obtain title over the lot or unit promptly after full payment
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As we have already held that the Deed of Absolute Sale and the
Contract to Sell do not involve subdivision lots, this section is clearly not
applicable to the mortgages executed in favor of Paramount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it has been shown that the lots were
mortgaged to the bank by one Eusebio Lopez and not by the Doña Agripina
Subdivision as the <span style="">petitioner </span>contends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, there is nothing in the said
provision which states that a mortgage executed without the approval of the NHA
(now the HLRUB) <span style="">is </span>null and
void.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have no copy of the supposed Fatima Subdivision decision nor
does the petitioner tell us where to find it, as he should.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not matter much, though, for from
what he tells us about it, it involves <span style="">a </span>subdivision lot and so does not apply to
the case before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth and fifth assignments of errors will be jointly
discussed as these involve the issue of ownership of the lots in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the conclusion of the respondent court that the
petitioner has not proved that he is the owner of the lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His evidence on this matter consisted only of
the deed of sale executed and signed by his father, the two receipts supposedly
issued by the Doña Agripina Subdivision, and his own testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by the trial court, it has not
even been shown that at the time of the alleged sale in favor of the
petitioner's father, the lots were owned by the Doña Agripina Subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two receipts allegedly issued by the subdivision are private
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In proving their due
execution and genuineness, it is not sufficient that the witness state in a
general manner that the person whose signature appears thereon was the one who
executed the document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of
an eyewitness authenticating a private document must be positive, categorically
stating that the document <span style="">was </span>actually
executed by the person whose name is subscribed thereto.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court notes that in the case at bar, the
details surrounding the execution of the petitioner's documentary evidence were
not even narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding Lot 2, it should be noted that the Deed of Absolute
Sale dated June 30, 1983, was duly registered, resulting in the issuance of TCT
No. 61529 in Manalo's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Section 51 of PD 1529, the act of registration is the operative act to convey or
affect the land insofar <span style="">as </span>third persons are concerned.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Section 44 of the same law provides that every registered owner receiving a
certificate of title in pursuance of a decree of registration shall hold the
same free from all encumbrances except those noted in said certificate and
those specifically mentioned by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This rule applies to every subsequent purchaser of registered land
taking <span style="">a </span>certificate
of title in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that Manalo is a purchaser in bad faith
as he knew Dy owned the lots in question before he bought it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that such knowledge of the
unregistered sale is equivalent to registration as held in the cases of
Winkleman v. Veluz, 43 Phil. 604, and Gustilo v. Maravilla, 48 Phil. 442.</p>

<p class="BODY">That is indeed the doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the Court has carefully reviewed the transcript of
stenographic notes and has found nothing to substantiate the petitioner's
gratuitous conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
Manalo testified that he <span style="">was </span>not aware that there were occupants of the lots when he
entered into the contracts with Planters, and that it was only when he went to
clear the properties that he came to know of Dy's adverse claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court believed <span style="">him, </span>and so do we, relying <span style="">on </span>its factual finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that as Manalo came to know about
the petitioner's possession and claim of ownership over the two lots only after
he had already bought the land, he cannot be considered <span style="">a </span>purchaser in bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>clear to the
Court that the challenged decision is not flawed by reversible error but, on
the contrary, conforms to the evidence of record and the applicable law and
jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against
the petitioner.</p>
