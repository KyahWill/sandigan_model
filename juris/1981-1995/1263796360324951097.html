<p class="BODY">Petitioners, the grandchildren and descendants of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> out of his union
with Elena <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, contended that <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> began occupying Lot 1236 long before the
advent of World War II and had cultivated the land by planting no less than 300
coconut trees, 19 mango trees, and 33 bamboo groves thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The occupation and possession by <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span>, his children, and
petitioners of Lot 1236 remained undisturbed until sometime in 1953 when
respondent Gregorio Bolo, a common law husband of one of the granddaughters of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, caused the survey of Lots 1236 and
1237 in June 1948, and proceeded to occupy Lot 1236 claiming to have purchased
the same on 11 April 1948 from respondent heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners contested the claim of respondent
Bolo and asserted that what had been sold to him was only <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1237 (area:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>5 hectares) and that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236 (area:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>20 hectares) was
surreptitiously declared by respondent Bolo in the aforementioned survey as
property owned exclusively by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also contended that respondent
Bolo, in his desire to consolidate possession and ownership of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236 in his name, harassed petitioners by instituting a criminal case for
qualified theft on <st1:date year="1953" day="7" month="10">7 October 1953</st1:date>
against <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amarante</span>

and by threatening to liquidate the other petitioners if they persisted in
their refusal to abandon the disputed property.</p>

<p class="BODY">For their part, respondents (defendants below), the grandchildren
and surviving heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, contended that
it was not improper for them to sell Lot 1236 to respondent Bolo on the ground
that said property had always been owned exclusively by Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>, contrary to the claim by petitioners that Lot 1236
was owned in common by the six<b> </b>children of <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>
<span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> by his two wives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents presented Tax Declaration No. 123
issued on <st1:date year="1948" day="7" month="8">7 August 1948</st1:date> in
the name of "<span class="SpellE">Herederos</span> de Felix <span class="SpellE">Malonis</span>" in support of their claim of ownership over <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1236, and in rebuttal of Tax Declaration No. 6051 issued in 1953 in the name of
<span class="SpellE">Malonis</span> <span class="SpellE">Infiel</span> which was
presented in evidence by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are of course aware of the familiar rule that, as a matter of

<p class="BODY">We are similarly not unmindful of the well-established rule that
the Court of Appeals is the final arbiter of questions of fact and, hence, the

Exceptions to this rule, however, likewise exist, such as when:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"(1) the conclusion is a finding

went beyond the issues of the case and its findings are contrary to the

court; (7) <u>the findings of fact are conclusions without<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>citation of specific evidence on which they
are based</u>; (8) the facts set forth in the petition as well as the

petitioners' and respondents' conflicting tax declarations covering Lot No.
1236, no explanation or documentation was offered by either the trial Judge or

offset the effects of defendants' tax declaration" was arrived at.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be readily evident that the mere
fact that petitioners' tax declaration was later in time than defendants' tax

adverted to and the portions of their testimonies found to have "loose
ends".</p>

<p class="BODY">(c)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge held
that the petitioners failed to prove their allegations of fraud, a conclusion
that the respondent appellate court upheld not by independent inquiry but by
saying that "the finding of the lower court as to the existence [or] the
non-existence of fraud is final and cannot be reviewed here unless clearly
shown to be erroneous." Once again, both decisions failed to document the
position taken on this crucial point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

which, had they been evaluated more carefully, might have altered the result of
this case altogether.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, there is
also the argument by petitioners that those who purportedly affixed their <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> to the Absolute Deed of Sale covering Lot 1236

consequences of their individual acts because they were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in stark contrast with respondent Bolo who, apart from being a local political
official in those days (he was a municipal councilor), was a schooled
individual -- apparently the only one among the contracting parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The detailed discussion of the evidence by
the petitioners was not dealt with at all, was in fact ignored, by the two courts

inequality, in level of understanding of formal transactions, between the
parties did not move either court to substantial efforts to make sure that the

<p class="BODY">The curious silence of the two courts on the foregoing matters,
coupled with the strikingly inadequate, practically non-existent discussion of <span class="GramE">the</span> facts and evidence in this case, must be viewed in the
light of an important public policy which bears upon this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That public policy is embodied, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, in Article 24 of the Civil Code which,
"in all contractual, property or other relations, when one of the parties
is at a disadvantage on account of his moral dependence, ignorance, indigence,
mental weakness, tender age<i> </i>or other handicap", enjoins courts to
be "vigilant for [the] protection [of such party]." This same public
policy is manifested in the recognition in our statute law and case law that
members of our cultural or ethnic minority groups, such as <span class="SpellE">Aetas</span>,
are commonly handicapped and vulnerable in dealing with other members of the
community and, therefore, need and deserve particular protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 145 (b) of the Revised Administrative
Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>, for instance, prescribes
that no conveyance or encumbrance of real property shall be made in the
territorial jurisdiction of that Department by a non-<span class="SpellE">christian</span>
inhabitant thereof unless, among other requirements, the deed is approved by
the Provincial Governor or his authorized representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 120 of the Pub<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the same kind of protection to all "non-<span class="SpellE">christian</span>
Filipinos" or "national cultural minorities", whether in
Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> or elsewhere; conveyances and
encumbrances made by illiterate non-<span class="SpellE">christians</span> (or by
literate non-<span class="SpellE">christians</span> if the deed is in a language
not understood by them) need the approval of the Chairman of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Commission of National Integration [now, the

Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes referred, in his characteristic, trenchant language,
