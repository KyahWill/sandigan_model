</span>It is also an admitted fact, at least impliedly, same being not denied
in petitioners' answer to the complaint, that the <span class="SpellE">Informacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Posesoria</span> was registered on </span><st1:date year="1895" day="25" month="5"><span style="">May 25,

the registration which they claim to have been done beyond the period of one
year from </span><st1:date year="1894" day="17" month="4"><span style="">April 17, 1894</span></st1:date><span style=""> to </span><st1:date year="1895" day="17" month="4"><span style="">April 17, 1895</span></st1:date><span style="">, as allegedly required by the Royal Decree
of </span><st1:date year="1894" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February 13, 1894</span></st1:date><span style=""> otherwise known as the Maura Law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The provision invoked by petitioners is Article 21 of the aforementioned
decree which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 21. A term of one year, without grace, is granted in
order to perfect the information referred to in Articles 19 and 20.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the expiration of this period, the right of the
cultivators and possessors to obtain a gratuitous title shall be extinguished;
the full ownership of the land shall be restored to the State, or in a proper
case to the community of neighbors, and the said possessors and cultivators or
their predecessors in interest by a universal title shall only be entitled to
the right of redemption, if the land had been sold within the five years
subsequent to the lapse of the period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The possessors not included within the provisions of this
Chapter shall only acquire for some time the ownership of the alienable lands
of the royal patrimony, in accordance with the common law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is the petitioners'
contention that pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provision,
all grants of Spanish titles to lands including <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information titles must be registered within a period of one </span>(1) <span style="">year to be counted from April 17, 1894 until
April 17, 1895, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">accordance with Article 80 of the rules and
regulations implementing said Royal Decree of February 13, 1894; that this
requirement of the law finds support in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
vs. Insular Government, 40 Phil. 267 and Romero vs. Director of Lands, 39 Phil.
814 from which petitioners quoted the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"All such titles covered by <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title during the Spanish Regime and not <u>registered</u> within
the non-extendible period of one year as provided for in the Maura Law or the
Royal Decree of <st1:date year="1894" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1894</st1:date>,
it reverts to the State or in a proper case to the public domain."
(Underscoring Supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners further
contend that inasmuch as the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> information
title of respondents, in the name of the late Juan <span class="SpellE">Ladao</span>,
was registered only on May 25, 1895 or 38 days from the last day of the
one-year period as provided in the Maura Law, the same was patently null and
void, and the land covered by said <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title reverted to the State or to the public domain of the govern­ment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners' contention
is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examining closely the
two cases invoked by petitioners, nowhere in said cases can be found the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> passages quoted by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These cases did not even speak of <u>registration</u>
as a requisite for the validity of <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title obtained for purposes of Royal Decree of </span><st1:date year="1894" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February
 13, 1894</span></st1:date><span style=""> or the
Maura Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was actually stated in
the two <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> cases are the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> information proceeding
instituted in accordance with the provi­sions of the Mortgage Law in force on
July 14, 1893 neither constitutes nor is clothed with the character of a
gratuitous title to property, referred to in Section 19 of the Royal Decree of
February 13, 1894, which provides that in order that an inform­ation may be
valid for the purpose of the said Royal Decree and produce the effects of a
title of ownership, it is indispensable that it be instituted within the <span class="SpellE">unextended</span> period of one year fixed in sections 19 and 20
of the said Royal Decree (<span class="SpellE"><u>Aguinaldo</u></span><u> de
Romero vs. Director of Lands, 39 Phil. 814)</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The time within which advantage could be taken of the Maura
Law expired on <st1:date year="1895" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1895</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almeida obtained dominion over 526 hectares

land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these conditions, the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> information could not even furnish, as in other

that there exists an <span class="SpellE"><u>informacion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></u> registered on <st1:date year="1895" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1895</st1:date> in the name of Juan <span class="SpellE">Ladao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>registration of the <span class="SpellE">informacion</span> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></u> must
have followed as the result or outcome of <span class="GramE">a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span></span> information proceeding instituted by the
late Juan <span class="SpellE">Ladao</span> in accordance with Section 19 of the
said Royal Decree of <st1:date year="1894" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1894</st1:date>,
and commenced within the one-year period, pursuant to Section 21 of the same
decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, if this were not so,
no registration of the said <span class="SpellE"><u>informacion</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span></u> might have been effected in the Registry of
Deeds of the Province of Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, for if
the registration thereof on May 25, 1895 was <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the decree, for being beyond the one-year period from April 17, 1894 to
April 17, 1895, the Register of Deeds would certainly not have performed an
illegal act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, registration of title usually follows a specified
proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The registration is the act
of a government official and may not be controlled by the private party
applying for registration of his title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What is under his control is the commencement or the institution of the
prescribed proceeding for the perfection of his title for which he may be
penalized for tardiness of compliance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The institution of the proper proceeding is clearly what is required to
be done within the one-year period by the party seeking to perfect his title,
not the registration thereof, if found legally warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By its nature, therefore, registration may
not necessarily be within the same one-year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the required proceedings are instituted,
as they have to be before the corre­sponding title may be issued and
registered, the registra­tion may be possible of accomplishment only after the
one-year period, considering the number of proceedings that might have been
instituted within the non-extendible period of one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what apparently happened in the
instant case with the proceeding to perfect the title commenced within the
one-year period, but the registration of the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
information title done thereafter, or on May 25, 1895, after the prescribed
proceeding which is naturally featured with the requisite notice and hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next question relates to the issue of prescription as raised
in the second assignment of error.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioners that the present action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> has already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They developed this theory in their Reply to
Rejoinder<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Even granting for the sake of argument that plaintiffs' <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> information title is valid and effective, the
cause of action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> had already
prescribed because such action can only be instituted within four (4) years
after discovery of the alleged fraud. (Sec. 55, Act 496; Vera vs. Vera, 47 <span class="SpellE">O.G</span>. 5060; <span class="SpellE">Tayao</span> vs. Robles, 74
Phil. 114) It will be noted from plaintiffs' complaint that the patent of
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Balbin</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Oriña</span>
were issued on <st1:date year="1956" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1956</st1:date>
so that if any action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> at all could
be instituted against the two defendants, the same should be instituted before
or during the period of four years or up to <st1:date year="1960" day="6" month="12">6 December, 1960</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">According to the complaint, the patents of Rosa Sta. Ma.</span> <span class="SpellE">Sytamco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sytamco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leocadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sytamco</span> were issued on <st1:date year="1959" day="17" month="4">17 April, 1959</st1:date>, so that if any action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> can lie against them, the same should be
instituted within four years or up to <st1:date year="1963" day="17" month="4">17
 April, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In so far as
the free patent of <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> V. Reyes, Lydia Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> Reyes, it appears that said patents were issued
on <st1:date year="1959" day="3" month="3">3 March, 1959</st1:date>, so that if
any action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> should be filed, it
should be on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And lastly, the patent of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> was issued on <st1:date year="1959" day="14" month="10">14 October, 1959</st1:date>, so that if any action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> should be instituted, the same should be filed
on or before <st1:date year="1963" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1963</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs' complaint was filed only on <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1973</st1:date>, <span style="">or </span>more than 14 years had already elapsed from the date of the
issuance of the respective titles of the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of land titled in the names of defendants had
already prescribed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of real
property resulting from fraud may be barred by the statute of limitations,
which <span style="">requires </span>that the action
shall be filed within four (4) years <span style="">from
</span>the discovery of the fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
discovery is deemed to have taken place when the petitioners herein were issued
original certificate of title through either homestead or free patent grants,
for the registration of said patents constitute constructive notice to the
whole world.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

contention that "if any action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
