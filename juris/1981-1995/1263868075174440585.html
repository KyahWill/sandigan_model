EDUARDO SORONIO Y GALUCAN, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Eduardo Soronio y Galucan was found guilty of rape committed
against Mary Grace Mabano, the 16-year-old classmate of his daughter,
Annabelle, and was sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information in
Criminal Case No. III?2254 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del
Norte, Branch 3, Iligan City, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about January 7, 1989, <span style="">in </span>the City of Iligan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a hunting knife, by means
of violence, threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully
and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned and against her will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to and in violation of Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code." (p. 13, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused having appealed, we have carefully reviewed the
records of the case and found two diametrically-opposed versions of the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence shows that on January 7, 1989 at about
6:30 in the evening, the complainant went to the house of the accused which was
only some fifteen meters away from her home in Kiwalan, Iligan City, to borrow
a book from her classmate Annabelle, who is Soronio's daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she arrived at the place, Soronio,
pretending that his daughter was around, asked Grace to come in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as Grace entered the door, he grabbed
her and slammed the door shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
covered her mouth with his left hand and pointing an eight-inch kitchen knife
at the side of her neck, he warned her not to shout or he would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she trembled in shock and fear, Soronio
quickly removed her panty as he pushed her down the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He removed his short pants and raised
Mabano's skirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While holding the knife
against her neck, he succeeded in having coitus with her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having consummated the act, appellant stood up and repeated his
warning to Grace that he would kill her and the rest of her family if she
should tell on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grace ran home
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mother, noticing that she
had been crying and that there was blood on her left leg, asked her what was
wrong, but she remained silent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, Grace stayed home, sad and brooding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her father arrived, he observed the
sudden change in his daughter and compelled her to talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grace ran to the kitchen <span style="">to </span>get a knife and take her life, but
her father was able to stop her in time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon further questioning, she broke down and poured out her story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was brought to Dr. Alfonso Gaite II of
the Iligan District Hospital, where she underwent a physical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doctor Gaite found a "ruptured hymen but
no laceration in her vagina, which was negative for sperm cells."</p>

<p class="BODY">The version for the defense was that Grace went to Soronio's
house at about 7:30 p.m. on January 7, 1989 to borrow P150 from the
accused-appellant as directed by her mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that time, appellant's mother Kilita, his daughter Annabelle, and a
78-year old neighbor, Fermin Guevarra, were allegedly in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant is separated from his
wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant allegedly gave Grace
P90, which was all that he had at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon receiving that amount, Grace allegedly told him that she would wait
for him in the vacant house in front of the Mabano home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to the designated place and found
Grace there waiting for him and they had sex.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that Grace was no longer a <span style="">virgin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims that Grace consented to have sex with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even implied that he had paid her for the
favor as shown by the absence of lacerations, scratches or abrasions on any
part of the victim's body.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's contention
deserves scant consideration.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For rape to be committed,
it is not necessary that there must be marks of physical violence on the
victim's body (People vs. Feliciano, 195 SCRA 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does absence of spermatozoa in the
vagina or thereabouts negate the commission of rape (People vs. Yambao, 193 SCRA
571), because it is penetration, however slight, and not ejaculation, that
constitutes rape (People vs. Gerones, 193 SCRA 263).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Virginity or chastity of the victim </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not an essential element of rape (People vs. Banayo, 195 SCRA 543;
People vs. Mercado, 190 SCRA 452).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The force employed in
rape need not be so great or of</span> <span style="">such
character that it could not </span>be <span style="">repelled
(People vs. Mercado, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all
women react similarly when subjected to the same force or intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some fight back as trapped tigers in defense
of their honor while others are cowed to obey from fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no standard form of behavior when
one is confronted by a shocking incident, as the workings of the mind under
stress are unpredictable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complainant's
behavior after the assault was wholly consistent with the charge of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went home hurt and crying and was silent
and brooding all evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her
father compelled her to divulge what happened to her, she attempted suicide
(pp. 16-20, TSN, March 9, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
these show that her traumatic experience had devastated her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony was direct, clear and to the
point.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both elements of
rape:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the offender had carnal
knowledge of </span>the <span style="">girl:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and (2) that such act was accomplished
through the use </span>of <span style="">force or intimidation
- are present in this case.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The required quantum of
proof beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of guilt is present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean
such a degree of proof as to exclude the possibility of error:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>only moral certainty is required (People vs.
Bacalzo, 195 SCRA 557).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the appealed decision is affirmed with
modification by ordering the appellant, Eduardo Soronio y Galucan to pay the
rape victim, Mary Grace Mabano, damages in the sum of P30,000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Narvasa, C.J., Cruz, Feliciano, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span>
Medialdea, JJ.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
