<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing, respondent trial judge rendered a
pre-trial order dated July 9, 1980 granting petitioners a period of ten days
from receipt of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>subdivision
plan to be prepared by a competent geodetic engineer within which to express
their approval or disapproval of the said plan, or to submit within the same
period, if they so desire, an alternative subdivision plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1980</st1:date>,
counsel for private respondents sent to the counsel for petitioners a letter
enclosed<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>with a subdivision plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioners filed their comment to the pre-trial order, contending that the
question of reasonable value of the subject properties remains a contentious
issue of fact ascertainable only after a full trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners likewise insisted on their
pre-emptive right to purchase private respondents’ shares in the co-ownership
after due determination of the reasonable price thereof.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, counsel for private respondents sent the counsel for
petitioners another subdivision plan prepared by a geodetic engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, no definite communication was sent by
petitioners signifying their approval or disapproval to the subdivision plans.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to settle once and for all the controversy between the
parties, private respondents filed a motion dated December 16, 1980 requesting
that petitioners be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">required </span>to
formally specify which of the two options under Article 498 of the New <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Civil </span>Code they wished to avail of
that petitioners’ shares in the subject properties be sold to private
respondents, at the rate of P12.50 per square meter; or that the subject
properties be sold to a third party, VOLCANO LAKEVIEW RESORTS, INC. (claimed to
have been erroneously referred to in the pre-trial as VOLCANO SECURITIES
TRADERS AND AGRI-BUSINESS CORPORATION) and its proceeds thereof distributed
among <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finding merit in the private respondents’ request, and for the
purpose of determining the applicability of Article 498 of the New Civil Code,
respondent trial judge issued an order dated February 4, 1981 which directed
the parties to signify whether or not they agree to the scheme of allotting the
subject properties to one of the co-owners, at the rate of P12.50 per square
meter, or whether or not they know of a third party who is able and willing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>buy the subject properties at terms
and conditions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">more </span>favorable
than that offered by VOLCANO LAKEVIEW RESORTS, INC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order contained a series of questions
addressed to all the parties, who were thereupon required to submit their
answers thereto.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a
</span>“<span class="SpellE">Constancia</span>” expressing that they were willing
to allot their shares in the subject properties to Socorro Marquez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span>, at the rate of
P12.50 per square meter, and that they did not know of any other party who was
willing and able to purchase the subject properties under more favorable
conditions than that offered by VOLCANO LAKEVIEW RESORTS, INC. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, instead of submitting their answers to the queries posed
by respondent trial judge, petitioners filed a motion for clarification <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to the true identity of the third
party allegedly willing to purchase the subject properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent trial judge rejected petitioners’ motion on the ground that it was
irrelevant.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, on February 27, 1981, petitioners filed a pleading
captioned “Compliance and Motion”, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">(1) </span>reiterating
the relevance of ascertaining the true<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>identity
of the third party buyer, VOLCANO SECURITIES TRADERS AND AGRI-BUSINESS
CORPORATION or VOLCANO LAKEVIEW RESORTS, INC., (2) expressing their view that
there is actually no bona fide and financially able third par<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">t</span>y willing to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">purchase </span>the subject<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>properties at the rate of P12.50 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">per square meter, and, (3) once </span>again
insisting on their pre-emptive right to purchase the shares of private
respondents in t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">h</span>e co-ownership
at <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>“reasonable price”, which
is less than that computed excessively by the latter at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rate of P12.50 per square </span>meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners therein prayed that further
proceedings be conducted in order to settle the factual issue regarding the
reasonable value of the subject properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent trial judge issued an order denying petitioners’ motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judge ruled that petitioners did not
possess a pre-emptive right to purchase <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">private
</span>respondents’ shares in the co-ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, finding that the subject properties were essentially indivisible,
respondent trial judge ordered the holding of a public sale of the subject
properties pursuant to Article 498 of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A notice of sale was issued setting the date
of public bidding for the subject properties on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then filed a motion for reconsideration from the
above order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent trial judge
reset the hearing on petitioners’ motion for reconsideration to <st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1981</st1:date>, and moved the scheduled
public sale to <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting resolution of their motion for reconsideration,
petitioners filed the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>, alleging that<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>the respondent trial judge acted
without jurisdiction, or in grave abuse of its discretion amounting to lack
jurisdiction, in issuing his order dated March 16, 1981 which denied
petitioners’ claim of a pre-emptive right to purchase private respondents’ pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares and which, peremptorily, ordered the public
sale of the subject properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1981</st1:date>, this Court issued a
temporary restraining order enjoining the sale of the subject properties at
public auction.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the comment and reply, the Court considered the issues
joined and the case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds no merit in the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attack on the validity of respondent trial judge’s order
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1981</st1:date> is
ultimately premised on petitioners’ claim that they had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>pre-emptive right to purchase the
pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares of their co-owners, private
respondents herein, at a “reasonable price”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is this same claim which forms the basis of their complaint for
injunction and damages filed against private respondents in the court a quo.</p>

<p class="BODY">This claim is patently without basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this jurisdiction, the legal provisions on
co-ownership do not grant to any of the owners of a property held in common a
pre-emptive right to purchase the pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his</span> co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners’ reliance on Article 1620 of the
New Civil Code is misplaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
1620 provides:</p>

<blockquote>A co-owner of a thing may exercise the <u>right</u> <u>of</u> <u>redemption</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in case </span>the shares of all the
co-owners or of any of <span class="GramE">them,</span> are sold to a third
person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the price of the alienation
is grossly excessive, the <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span> shall pay only
a reasonable one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should two or more co-owners desire to exercise the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">right</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">redemption</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>they may only do so in proportion to
the share they may respectively have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
</span>the thing owned in common [Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1620 contemplates of a situation where a co-owner has
alienated his pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares to a stranger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the very nature of the right of “legal
redemption”, a co-owner’s right to redeem is invoked only after the shares of
the other co-owners are sold to a third party or stranger to the co-ownership [<u>See</u>
Estrada v. Reyes, 33 Phil. 31 (1915).]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But in the case at bar, at the time petitioners filed their complaint
for injunction and damages against private respondents, no sale of the latter’s
pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares to a third party had yet been
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Article 1620 of the New
Civil Code finds no application to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is likewise no merit to petitioners’ contention that
private respondents had acknowledged the pre-emptive right of petitioners to
purchase their shares at a “reasonable price”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although it appears that private respondents had agreed to sell their
pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares to petitioners, the offer was
made at a fixed rate of P12.50 per square meter [<u>See</u> Pre-trial Order
dated <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1980</st1:date>, Annex
“C” of the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 43-45.] It cannot be
said that private respondents had agreed, without qualification, to sell their
shares to petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
petitioners cannot insist on a right to purchase the shares at a price lower than
the selling price of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do petitioners have the legal right to enjoin private
respondents from alienating their pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares
to a third party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rights of a
co-owner of a property are clearly specified in Article 493 of the New Civil Code,
thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Article 493.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each co-owner shall have the full ownership
of his part and of the fruits and benefits pertaining <span class="GramE">thereto,</span>
and he may therefore alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute
another person in its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the effect of the alienation of the
mortgage, with respect to the co-owners shall be limited <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to the portion </span>which may be allotted
to him in the division upon the termination of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the Court holds that respondent trial
judge committed no grave abuse of discretion when he denied petitioners’ claim
of a pre-emptive right to purchase private respondents’ pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>
shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is no legal infirmity tainting respondent trial
judge’s order for the holding of a public sale of the subject properties
pursuant to the provisions of Article 498 of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a
</span>careful examination of the proceedings before respondent trial judge,
the Court finds that respondent trial judge’s order was issued in accordance

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that private respondents, in their answer with
counterclaim prayed for, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, the partition of
the subject properties in the event that the petitioners refused to purchase
their pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares at the rate of P12.50<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>per square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike petitioners’ claim of a pre-emptive
right to purchase the other co-owners’ pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>
shares, private respondents’ counterclaim for the partition of the subject
properties is recognized by law, specifically Article 494 of the New Civil Code
which lays down the general rule that no co-owner is obliged to remain in the
co-ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 494 reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>No co-owner shall be obliged to remain in the co-ownership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each co-owner may demand at any time
partition of the thing owned in common, insofar as his share is concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nevertheless, an agreement to keep the thing undivided for a
certain period of time, not exceeding ten years, shall be valid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This term may be extended by a new agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">A </span>donor or testator
may prohibit partition for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>period
which shall not exceed twenty years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Neither shall there be partition when it is prohibited by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No prescription shall run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against
his co-owners or co-heirs so long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes the
co-ownership.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">None of the legal exceptions under Article 494 applies to the
case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents’
counterclaim for the partition of the subject properties was therefore entirely
proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, during the pre-trial
proceedings, petitioners adopted the position that the subject properties were
incapable of physical partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Initially, private respondents disputed this position. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>But after petitioners inexplicably refused to
abide by the pre-trial order issued by respondent trial judg<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">e,</span> and stubbornly insisted on
exercising an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">alleged </span>pre-emptive
right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to</span>
purchase private respondents’ shares at a “reasonable price”, private respondents
relented and adopted petitioner’s position that the partition of the subject
properties was not economically feasible; and, consequently, invoked the
provisions of Article 498 of the New Civil Code [Private respondents’ “Motion
To Allot Properties To Defendants Or To Sell The Same Pursuant To Article 498
Of The Civil Code”, Annex “D” of the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 46-49.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
parties were <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>agreement as
regards the fact that the subject properties should not be partitioned, and private
respondents continued to manifest their desire to terminate the co-ownership
arrangement between petitioners and themselves, respondent trial judge acted
within his jurisdiction when he issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his
order</span> dated February 4, 1981 requiring the parties to answer certain
questions for the purpose of determining whether or not the legal conditions
for the applicability of Article 498 of the New Civil Code were present in the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 498 provides that:</p>

<blockquote>Whenever the thing is essentially indivisible and the co-owners
cannot agree that it be allotted to one of them who shall indemnify t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">he</span> others, it shall be sold <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">proceeds </span>distributed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The sale of the property held in common referred to in the above
article <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>resorted to when (1)
the right to partition the property among the co-owners is invoked by any one
of them but because of the nature of the property, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">it </span>cannot be subdivided or its subdivision [<u>See</u> Article
495 of the New Civil Code] would prejudice the interests of the co-owners [<u>See</u>
Section 5 of Rule 69 of the Revised Rules of Court] and (2) the co-owners are <u>not</u>
in agreement as to who among them shall be allotted or assigned the entire
property upon reimbursement of the shares of the other co-owners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners herein did not have justifiable grounds to ignore the
queries posed by respondent trial judge and to insist that hearings be
conducted in order to ascertain the reasonable price at which they could
purchase private respondents’ pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span> shares
[Petitioners’ “Compliance and Motion” dated February 27, 1981, Annex “H” of the
Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 57-60.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Since at this point in the case it became reasonably evident to
respondent trial judge that the parties could not agree on who among them would
be allotted the subject properties, the Court finds that respondent trial judge
committed no grave abuse of discretion in ordering the holding of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>public <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sale for </span>the subject properties (with
the opening bid pegged at P12.50 per square meter,) and the distribution of the
<span class="GramE">proceeds</span> thereof amongst the co-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">owners, as </span>provided Under Article 498
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">New </span>Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioners’ contention, there was no need for
further hearings in the case because it is apparent from the various
allegations and admissions of the parties made during the pre-trial
proceedings, and in their respective pleadings, that the legal requisites for
the application of Article 498 of the New Civil Code were present in the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No factual issues remained to be
litigated upon.</p>
