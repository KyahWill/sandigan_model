Branch 82 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) at Odiongan, Romblon granted the
application of the private respondents, who are American citizens, to bring
within the operation of the Land Registration Act a parcel of land with an area
of 3,194,788 square meters (319.4788 hectares) which spreads across the
barangays of Canduyong, Anahao and Ferrol in the municipality of Odiongan,
Province of Romblon, and to confirm their title thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals; he
alleged therein that the trial court erred (a) in not declaring the private
respondents barred by the Constitution from applying for registration because
they are American citizens and are thus disqualified from acquiring lands in the
Philippines, (b) in holding that private respondents had established
proprietary rights over the land even before acquiring American citizenship
through naturalization, and (c) independently of the issue of alienage, in not
dismissing the application for registration on the basis of the private
respondents' failure to overthrow, by conclusive or well-nigh incontrovertible
proof, the presumption that the land applied for is public land belonging to
the State.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The records disclose the following material operative facts and
procedural antecedents:</p>

<p class="BODY">A certain Charles Hankins, an American who was married to Laura
Crescini and who resided in Canduyong, Odiongan, Romblon, died on 31 May 1937
leaving a will (Exhibit "N").  He was survived by his widow; his sons Alexander and William; and his
grandchildren Ismael, Samuel and Edgar, all surnamed Buyco, who are the
legitimate issues of his deceased daughter Lilia and her husband Marcelino
Buyco.  The will was submitted for
probate before the then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of
Romblon.  Charles Hankins' son Alexander
was appointed administrator of the estate in Special Proceedings No. 796.</p>

<p class="BODY">Laura Crescini died on 22 December 1941.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that in a Project of Partition dated 25 June 1947
(Exhibit "O") and submitted to the probate court in the aforesaid
Special Proceedings No. 796, one of the properties of Charles Hankins described
as "a parcel of pastureland, riceland and coconut land containing an area
of about 250 hectares, 21 ares and 63 untares x x x assessed at for P6,950.00

acres, or 197.086 hectares (1 hectare = 2.471 acres).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 July 1948, Laura's share in the estate of her husband
Charles was partitioned among her children, Alexander and William, and her
grandchildren, Ismael, Samuel and Edgar who were represented by their father
Marcelino Buyco (Exhibit "P").  Thereafter, on the same date, William sold his hereditary shares in the
estate of his parents to Marcelino Buyco (Exhibit "R").</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 August 1962, Marcelino Buyco donated to his children the
property acquired from William together with other properties (Exhibit
"S").</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 September 1970, the Buyco brothers partitioned among
themselves the properties acquired by inheritance from their grandparents and
by donation from their father (Exhibit "T").  However, Ismael waived his right to his
share therein in favor of Samuel, one of the private respondents in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Edgar and Samuel Buyco became naturalized American citizens on 29
January 1972 and 12 September 1975, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 October 1976, Edgar and Samuel, through their
attorney-in-fact, Rieven H. Buyco, filed before the then Court of First
Instance of Romblon an application for the registration of a parcel of land,
described as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"A parcel of land (Lot I, under surveyed for the heirs of Lilia

they acquired the same by inheritance and donation <i>inter vivos</i>.  However, they allege in paragraph 9 of the
application that should the Land Registration Act be inapplicable, the benefits
provided for under C.A. No. 141, as amended, be made to extend to them since
both they and their predecessors-in-interest have been in possession thereof
since time immemorial.  The application
was docketed as Land Registration Case No. N-48 LRC Record No. N-51706.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above description is based on a survey plan prepared by
private land surveyor Santiago Español in 1950 (Exhibit "C") and
subsequently approved by the Director of Lands.  While in their application, private respondents invoked the provisions
of the Land Registration Act,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> they

further amended by P.D. No. 1073.</p>

<p class="BODY">While only the herein petitioner filed an opposition thereto, the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) manifested that the portion of the
property pertaining to Samuel Buyco is covered by a mortgage in its favor.  After the jurisdictional facts had been
established during the initial hearing and a general order of default entered
against all other parties, the lower court designated the Judge of the
Municipal Trial Court of Odiongan as commissioner to receive the evidence for
the parties.  Samuel Buyco, William
Hankins, Manuel Firmalo and Jacinta Gomez Gabay (who was 83 years old when she
took the witness stand in October of 1979) testified for the applicants.  The first two (2) recounted the history of
the tract of land up to the time of the abovementioned partitions and the
alleged possession of the entire area by the applicants (private respondents
herein).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 5 February 1985, the land registration court handed down a
Decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"PREMISES CONSIDERED, this Court hereby orders the
registration of title to the parcel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>land
designated as Lot No. 1 Psu-127238 and its technical description together with
all the improvements thereon, in the name of the herein applicants, recognizing
the interest of the Development Bank of the Philippines to be annotated on the
certificate of title to be issued as mortgagee for the amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P200,000.00 </span>with respect to the share
of applicants (sic) Samuel H. Buyco.</p>

<p class="2Q">Upon the decision become (sic) final let the corresponding decree
and certificate of title be issued accordingly."</p>

<p class="BODY">The favorable decision is based on the court's conclusion that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The oral and documentary evidence indubitably show applicants
and their predecessors-in-interest -- their grandparents Charles Hankins and
Laura Crescini, to their uncle Alexander Hankins, to them thru their
administrators Gregorio Gabay and later Manuel Firmalo -- have possessed the
property herein sought to be registered in the concept of owners thereof, and
such possession has been continuous, uninterrupted, adverse, open and public
for a period of more than eighty years.  And their right over the property is duly recognized by the adjoining
owners in their individual affidavits marked as Exhibits "V",
“V-1" to "V-21", inclusive.  Moreover, none of the adjoining owners filed any opposition to the
herein land registration case, thereby indubitably showing their recognition of
the correctness of the boundary (sic) between their individual lots and that of
applicants' land subject of this registration.</p>

<p class="2Q">The late Charles Hankins declared said land for taxation purposes
under Tax Declaration No. 15853 (please see description of lot in Exh.
"N") and thereafter in the name of applicants and/or their father
Marcelino Buyco since 1949 up to the present time (Exhs. "W",
"W-1" to "W-19").</p>

<p class="2Q">Applicants have also paid the real estate taxes thereon since 1948
up to the present time (Exhs. "X", "X-1" to
"X-194").</p>

<p class="2Q">In 1950, the land of applicants was surveyed by Private Surveyor
Santiago Español and its exact metes and bounds were determined with accuracy
in his survey plan PSU-127238 (Exh. "C").  This survey corrected the impreciseness of the land area as
mentioned in the several instruments -- the will, project of partition, deed of
partition, deed of sale (Exhs. "N", "O", "P", and
"R") -- under which applicants acquired the land in question.  The correctness of this survey is further
shown by the fact that none of the other heirs, like Alexander Hankins nor
(sic) the adjoining owners ever made a claim over any portion of the lot shown
in said Psu-­127238.</p>

<p class="2Q">The land in question has been primarily devoted to cattle graxing
(sic) and to the cultivation of rice and coconut and it was (sic) the
applicants and their predecessors-in-interest have (sic) been reaping the
fruits thereof.</p>

<p class="2Q">The evidence further show (sic) that applicants can rightfully and
did validly acquire title and ownership over the land in question because they
were then Filipino citizens, their father Marcelino Buyco being a Filipino
citizen himself (please see personal circumstances of Marcelino Buyco in Exhs.
"P" and "R") and their modes of acquisition -- ­by inheritance,
intestate succession, and donation inter-vivos -- are all legally recognized
modes to transfer ownership to them from their predecessors-in-interest.</p>

<p class="2Q">Since time immemorial, applicants and their
predecessors-in-interest have exercised all the attributes of dominion and
absolute ownership over the land in question, and have therefore established
their vested proprietary rights and registrable (sic) title over the land in
question, rights which they have acquired long before they became citizens of
the United States (Edgar Buyco became a U.S. citizen only on January 29, 1972;
while Samuel H. Buyco, only on September 12, 1975.  As a matter of fact, applicant Samuel H. Buyco mortgaged in favor
of the Development Bank of the Philippines (Exhs. "U",
"U-1" and "U-2") the portion belonging to him in Lot 1,
Psu-127238.</p>

<p class="2Q">From the foregoing evidence it has been satisfactorily established
that the applicants have acquired an imperfect and incomplete title over the
parcel of land subject of this registration proceedings in their own right as
citizens of the Philippines so as to entitle them to a confirmation and
registration of said lot in their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">names.  </span>Consequently Section II, Article XVII
of the 1973 Constitution does not apply to this case, neither (sic) does this case
fall under the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 713."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">More specifically, the conclusion regarding possession is based
on the testimonies of Manuel Firmalo, William Hankins and Jacinta Gomez Gabay
which, as summarized by the court, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and at the time of termination of his administration there were 300 heads; that
from time to time, some cattle in the ranch were sold by him and he rendered an
accounting to the applicants, the owners of the ranch; that he employed
cowhands to help him ran (sic) the ranch of applicants and the salaries of said
cowhands were paid out of the funds of applicant Samuel Buyco from the sale of
the cattle; that the proceeds of the coconuts harvested, the money was (sic)
deposited with the bank and a portion was used for the payment of the real
estate taxes on the land; that during his administration no third person ever

mortgage with the DBP over said land; that from the proceeds of the sale of the
copra harvested from the land of applicants, he paid the real estate taxes
thereon specifically the taxes covered by Exhs. "X-83" to

by his father (Charles Hankins); that the possession of his father was in the
concept of owner, continuous, adverse, public, and open, up to his (Charles
Hankins) death; that after receiving his hereditary share from the estates of
his father and mother, he sold his said shares to Marcelino Buyco, father of
applicants by executing a Deed of Sale (Exh. "R") dated July 30, 1948;
that during the lifetime of Charles Hankins, the big tract of land was devoted
primarily to cattle grazing and to coconut and rice; that after he sold his
hereditary share of (sic) Marcelino Buyco, the latter took possession of his
said portion; that after Marcelino Buyco died, the property of Marcelino Buyco
(including his share (sic) hereditary share sold under Ex. (sic) "R")
was transmitted to his children, namely:  Edgar H. Buyco, Ismael Buyco and Samuel H. Buyco (Samuel and Edgar
Buyco, the (sic) applicants herein); that he knows that at present the owners
in possession of the property subject of this registration proceedings are

cattle grazing and planted with coconuts and rice.</p>

the property is a big tract of land; x x x that when she was living with the
Hankins spouses, said spouses already owned and were in possession of this big
tract of land, and this land was fenced off with barbed wires, and that said

of reason up to the present time; that during all the time that she has been
with said Hankins spouses, nobody ever claimed any portion thereof; that this
property extended from barrio Canduyong up to barrio Anahao; that after Charles
Hankins died, his property was divided among his children Alexander Hankins,
William Hankins and Lilia Hankins and the latter's share was received by her

<p class="BODY">As earlier adverted to, petitioner's appeal from the said
decision was dismissed by the public respondent for lack of merit.  As to the private respondents' title to the
land subject of the application, public respondent makes the following findings:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Undisputably, applicants-appellees anchored their title to
the land in question by means of hereditary succession as well as donation from
their own father, Marcelino Buyco, who purchased the entire hereditary share of
William Hankins (Exh. "R").  Subsequently, applicants-appellees and their brother, Ismael,
partitioned their hereditary share from their grandparents, the spouses
Hankins, including the property donated by their father, Marcelino Buyco, in an
instrument dated September 8, 1970 (Exh. "T").  In this partition, the share of Ismael H.
Buyco went to applicant-appellee Samuel H. Buyco (Exh. "T-1").</p>

<p class="2Q">From the records extant in this case, it is Our considered view
that from almost (sic) time immemorial or a period of eighty (80) years,
applicants-appellees through their predecessors-in-interest have been in
actual, continuous, and peaceful possession of the property in question so that
the inescapable conclusion is that all along it is private land and had been
segregated from the dominium (sic) of the State.  Thus, We sustain the conclusion reached by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
that the latter (applicants-appellees) thru their predecessors-in-interest have
acquired title by acquisitive prescription over the same, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x.”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

this in their favor.  Thus, both courts

this rule was to find anchorage in policy considerations based no less on one
of the fundamental objectives of the Constitution, namely the conservation and
utilization of our natural resources.  We held in the said case that there would be a failure to abide by its
command if the judiciary does not scrutinize with care applications to private
ownership of real estate.  This Court

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, private respondents' evidence miserably
failed to establish their imperfect title to the property in question.  Their allegation of possession since time
immemorial, which was conceded by the land registration court and the public
respondent, is patently baseless.  There
is an evident failure to comprehend the meaning and import of the term <u>immemoria</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">l</span></u>.  As defined, <u>immemorial</u> simply means beyond the reach of

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Such possession was never present in the case of the private respondents.  The trial court and the public respondent
based the finding of the more than eighty (80) years of possession by the
private respondents and their predecessors-in-interest on the sole testimony of
Mrs. Gabay who was eighty-three (83) years old when she testified in October of
1979.  Thus, she must have been born in
1896.  If the asserted possession lasted
for a period of more than eighty (80) years at the time she testified, the same
must have commenced sometime in 1899, or at the time that she was barely three
(3) years old.  It is quite impossible
that she could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">fully </span>grasp,
before coming to the age of reason, the concept of possession of such a big
tract of land and testify on the same some eight (8) decades later.  In short, therefore, she cannot be relied
upon to prove the possession by Charles Hankins of the said property from 1899.</p>

<p class="BODY">Charles Hankins was an American citizen.  There is no evidence to show the date of his
birth, his arrival in the Philippines -- particularly in Odiongan, Romblon --
or his acquisition of the big tract of land; neither is there any evidence to
prove the manner of his acquisition thereof.  Thus, there does not even exist a reasonable basis for the finding that
the private respondents and their predecessors-in-interest possessed the land
for more than eighty (80) years, much less since time immemorial.  In <i>Oh Cho vs. Director of Lands,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
possession which began in <u>1880</u> was not considered as possession
"since time immemorial."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, as well, no evidence on record to show that Charles Hankins
cultivated, had control over or used the whole or even a greater portion of the
big tract of land for grazing purposes.  None of the witnesses testified as to the number of heads of cattle
which were brought by Charles into the land.  There is likewise no competent proof that he declared the land in his
name for taxation purposes or that he had paid the taxes thereon.  Although his will (Exhibit "N")
made mention of Tax Declaration No. 15853, neither the said declaration nor any
tax receipt was presented in evidence.  Because of such non-production, it cannot be determined when Charles
initially declared his alleged land for taxation purposes and what exactly were
its natural boundaries, if any.  It is
clear that the non-production of this tax declaration accounted for the obvious
inability of the witnesses to testify with certainty as to the extent of the
area of the property.  As correctly
observed by the petitioner, none of the private respondents' witnesses could
give the court a definite idea thereon.  Thus, Samuel Buyco declared:</p>

<p class="2Q">"I really don't know the exact area, but it is between 500 to
550 hectares."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, even if Charles had indeed declared the property
for taxation purposes and actually paid taxes, such facts are still
insufficient to justify possession thereof, much less a claim of ownership
thereon.  This Court has repeatedly held
that the declaration of ownership for purposes of assessment on the payment of
the tax is not sufficient to prove ownership.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To this Court's mind, private respondents failed to prove that
Charles Hankins had possessed the property -- allegedly covered by Tax
Declaration No. 15853 and made the subject of both his last will and testament
and the project of partition of his estate among his heirs -- in such a manner
as to remove the same from the public domain under the <i>Cariño </i>and <i>Susi
</i>doctrines.  Thus, when he died on 31
May 1937, he transmitted no right whatsoever, with respect to the said
property, to his heirs.  This being the
case, his possession cannot be tacked to that of the private respondents for
the latter's benefit pursuant to Section 48 (b) of the Public Land Act, the
alternative ground relied upon in their application.  It would have been entirely different if the possession of
Charles was open, continuous, exclusive, notorious and under a <i>bona fide </i>claim
of ownership as provided under Section 48 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of
</span>the Public Land Act.  Even if he
were an American citizen at that time, he would have had the same civil rights
as Filipino citizens pursuant to the original ordinance appended to the 1935
Constitution.  The pertinent portion of
said ordinance reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"(17) Citizens and corporations of the United States shall
enjoy <i>in the Commonwealth of the Philippines </i>all the civil rights of the
citizens and corporations, respectively, thereof."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The import of said paragraph (17) was
confirmed and reinforced originally by Section 44 of Act No. 2874 and Section
127 of C.A. No. 141 (The Public Land Act of 1936); the latter provided that:</p>

granted to citizens and corporations of the Philippines under this Act."</p>

<p class="BODY">This right, however, vanished with the advent of the Philippine

<p class="BODY">Verily, private respondents had to rely exclusively on their own
possession.  Under the applicable law at
the time, it was incumbent upon them to prove that they had been in open, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">continuous, exclusive and notorious
possession and occupation of agricultural land of the public domain, under a </span><i>bona
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fide </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claim of acquisition of ownership for at
least thirty (30) years immediately preceding the filing of the applications
for confirmation of title, except when prevented by war or <i>force majeure.</i></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">By their own evidence, private respondents admitted that they
were never in actual possession of the property prior to the filing of their
application.  During the pendency of
Special Proceedings No. 796, the estate of Charles Hankins appeared to have
been administered by his son Alexander.  This administration was terminated in 1948 upon the execution of the
Project of Partition.  Private respondents
and their brother Ismael did not take possession of the share which pertained
to their mother, Lilia; instead, they allegedly hired Gregorio Gabay to
administer the same.  There is, however,
no competent evidence to show the extent of such administration.  Moreover, notwithstanding the fact that
Gregorio had the property declared for taxation purposes, the correct area and
boundaries of the same have not been proven.  As evidenced by the Project of Partition, the share of Lilia was only
125 acres or 50.59 hectares, which is clearly not the portion applied for.  The area applied for consists of 319.4788
hectares of land based on a survey plan prepared by private land surveyor
Español on the basis of a survey conducted in 1950.  Obviously, therefore, the plan was not prepared to determine
Lilia's share alone for, as admitted by the private respondents themselves,
this plan includes William Hankins’ share which was sold to Marcelino Buyco,
private respondents' father, and the other properties which the latter donated
to the private respondents and Ismael Buyco on 20 August 1962 (Exhibit
"S").  However, there is no
competent evidence as to the respective boundaries and areas of the properties
constituting the said share of William Hankins; neither are there reliable
descriptions of the other alleged properties belonging to Marcelino Buyco.  Be that as it may, when the survey was
conducted by Español, private respondents and their brother Ismael did not
immediately acquire the portion originating from William Hankins and the other
alleged properties of Marcelino Buyco; hence, there was no valid basis for the
inclusion of said properties in the survey.  And even if both William's share and Marcelino Buyco's properties were
included, there would still be nothing to support the application for the
entire 319.4788 hectares considering that as per the Project of Partition, the
share pertaining to William consisted only of 50.59 hectares.  There was, moreover, no evidence to show the
extent of the alleged "other properties" of Marcelino Buyco.  Given such circumstances, it would be
reasonable to presume that what was surveyed in 1950 was the entire pasture
land alleged to form part of the estate of Charles Hankins, covered by Tax
Declaration No. 15853, and which necessarily included the share of Alexander
Hankins.  Significantly, per Exhibit
"O", the latter's share is specified as part of the property covered
by Tax Declaration No. 15853.  The
inclusion then of Alexander's share in the survey and the plan may provide the
clue to this unusual increase in the area covered by the survey plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, even if We are to assume for argument's sake that
there was nothing irregular in the inclusion in the survey plan of the share of
William Hankins and the other properties of Marcelino Buyco, the fact remains
that the "ownership" thereof could have been acquired by the private
respondents and Ismael Buyco only on 20 August 1962 upon the execution of the
deed of donation in their favor.  To be
thus benefited by the possession of William or Marcelino for purposes of
Section 48 (b) of the Public Land Act, there should be proof that said
predecessors had been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious possession
and occupation thereof.  Unfortunately,
no such proof was offered.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is palpably obvious then that at the time Land Registration
Case No. N-48 was filed in the Regional Trial Court of Romblon on 14 October
1976, private respondents did not have in their favor an imperfect title over
that which they claimed to have inherited, by representation, from the estate
of Charles Hankins.  With greater force
does this conclusion likewise apply with respect to the properties donated to
them in 1962 by their father Marcelino Buyco.  This is because they were not able to prove open, continuous, exclusive
and notorious possession and occupation thereof under a <i>bona fide</i> claim
of acquisition of ownership for at least thirty (30) years immediately
preceding the filing of the application,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a> or

<p class="BODY">Considering that the private respondents became American citizens
before such filing, it goes without saying that they had acquired no vested
right, consisting of an imperfect title, over the property before they lost
their Philippine citizenship.</p>

Act No. 926, enacted on 7 October 1903 by the Philippine Commission, prescribed
the rules and regulations governing the homesteading, selling and leasing of portions
of the public domain and the forms and conditions to enable persons to perfect
their titles to public lands.  Act No.
2874, enacted by the Philippine Legislature and approved on 29 November 1919,
was an act to amend and compile the laws relative to lands of the public
domain.  Section 45 of Act No. 2874
corresponded to Section 48(b) of C.A. 141 (The Public Land Act); however, the
benefits in the former, which were extended to citizens of the United States of
America (Section 44), could only be availed of not later than 31 December 1928.</p>
