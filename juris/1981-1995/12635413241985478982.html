				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Oroquieta City, 10th Judicial Region, Branch XII convicting defendant-appellant Eufemio Egas of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote> "WHEREFORE, and in view of all the foregoing, this Court finds the accused Eufemio Egas alyas Dodong guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape as defined in Article 335 (2) of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i>, to indemnify the offended party Nazarita Baluyos Suan in the sum of P12,000.00, to acknowledge and support Joel Suan, the child born to Nazarita Suan as a result of the crime, with the accessories of the law and to pay the costs."</blockquote>The information dated January 12, 1979 filed against the accused-appellant alleged that:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 3rd day of June, 1978, at barangay Bolangog, in the municipality of Lopez Jaena, province of Misamis Occidental, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said accused, by means of violence and intimidation and by first making offended party Nazarita Baluyos Suan unconscious, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of said offended party Nazarita Baluyos Suan, against her will, and in her house.<br><br>"ALL CONTRARY TO LAW and with aggravating circumstance that the said offense was committed in the dwelling of the offended party, the latter not having given provocation for the offense."</blockquote>The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the People's brief as follows:<br><blockquote>"Complainant Nazarita Suan and appellant are third cousins living in separate houses in Bolangog, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental.&nbsp; At about 1:30 p.m. of June 3, 1978, complainant was alone in the kitchen of her house, listening to the radio.&nbsp; Her parents and elder brother Jaime were then in Senote, Oroquieta City attending to some business.&nbsp; Appellant stealthily entered the house through the kitchen door, immediately hugged complainant and pulled her towards the sala.&nbsp; Complainant vigorously resisted appellant's advances.&nbsp; When she shouted for help, appellant boxed her on the chest, rendering her unconscious.&nbsp; In that state, complainant was ravished by appellant.<br><br>"When complainant woke up, she found herself naked and her vagina bleeding.&nbsp; She saw appellant seated in the kitchen.&nbsp; Appellant warned her not to tell her parents about the incident.&nbsp; Otherwise, he will kill her and her parents.&nbsp; There­after, appellant left and complainant cried.&nbsp; Because of appellant's threat of harm, complainant, who was then only 14 years old, did not immediately inform her parents about the incident.<br><br>"However, in the evening of August 5, 1978, Nazarita complained of stomach ache.&nbsp; It did not subside until the following morning.&nbsp; So her mother, Laureta, massaged her abdominal region and discovered that she was pregnant.&nbsp; When her mother inquired on what happened, only then did complainant reveal for the first time appellant's assault on her.&nbsp; Laureta immediately informed her husband, Sulpicio, about the incident.&nbsp; Sulpicio ordered Laureta to invite appellant's parents to their house for a confrontation regarding the incident.&nbsp; In that confrontation, appellant's parents suggested that appellant and complainant be married.&nbsp; Sulpicio replied that he still has to find out from complainant if she will agree to marry appellant.&nbsp; Appellant's parents promised to return on August 8, 1978 to know complainant's decision.&nbsp; Complainant refused to marry appellant.&nbsp; At any rate, appellant's parents failed to return.&nbsp; On August 14, 1978, Dr. Jose P. Libunao examined complainant and found her to be three to four months pregnant (Exh. A).<br><br>"Hence, complainant filed rape charges aginst appellant.&nbsp; After due investigation, appellant was charged with rape in an information dated January 12, 1979.&nbsp; As a result of the rape, a baby boy was born on February 27, 1979 (Exh. D).&nbsp; [tsn., pp. 8-9, 14, July 2, 1979; pp. 2-13, Oct. 10, 1979; pp. 14-18, Dec. 6, 1979; pp. 14-32, Dec. 7, 1979; pp. 2-14, Feb. 4, 1980 ]."</blockquote>On August 14, 1978, Dr. Jose P. Libunao III, a resident physician at the Misamis Occidental Provincial Hospital, Oroquieta City, examined complainant Nazarita Suan.&nbsp; Dr. Libunao issued the following medical certificate which contained the following findings:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="11%"><div align="center">"= </div></td><td width="89%">NORMAL EXTERNAL GENITALIA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">= </div></td><td>VAGINA ADMITS TWO FINGERS WITH EASE</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">= </div></td><td>OLD HYMENAL LACERATION AT 4:00 O'CLOCK AND 6:00 O'CLOCK </td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">=</div></td><td>INTERNAL OS EXUDING WITISH MILKY FLUID INTO POSTERIOR FORNIX</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">=</div></td><td>CERVIX CLOSED, SOFTISH ON PALPATION</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">= </div></td><td><p>UTERUS MIDLINE, ENLARGED WITH FUNDI HEIGHT ABOUT 3-4 CM.

The defense evidence is summarized in the accused-appellant's brief as follows:<br><blockquote>"Eufemio Egas testified that he and the offended party were sweethearts.&nbsp; They kept their relationship secret because their parents were against it considering that they were blood relatives.&nbsp; While their relationship as sweethearts was existing, he visited the offended party regularly at their house and even have sexual relations with her especially when her parents were not around.&nbsp; He started having sexual relations with her in December 1977.&nbsp; During the latter part of July 1978, the offended party informed him that she was pregnant.&nbsp; Although he was a little frightened of the thought of her being pregnant, nonetheless he assured her that she need not worry because he was going to marry her anyway.&nbsp; On August 8, 1978, the mother of the offended party went to his house and inquired into the truth of their daughter's pregnancy.&nbsp; The accused admitted having impregnated Nazarita Suan and intimidated to them of his plan to marry her considering that they were sweethearts.&nbsp; Thereafter, his parents went to the Suan's residence for a talk and when they returned home, they told him that they would apply for a marriage license on 8 August 1978.&nbsp; However on the date agreed upon, accused failed to go to the office of the Local Civil Registrar of Lopez Jaena to apply for marriage license because on said date, he played in the basketball tournament in Hasaan, Lopez Jaena, Misamis Occidental where he was the captain ball of their barangay's basketball team and that he had previously asked his mother to inform the Suan's about his inability to go to the Local Civil Registrar's Office on the said date.&nbsp; After the said basketball tournament, he returned home on August 9, 1978 and he learned that his mother had a quarrel with the mother of the offended party on August 6, 1978.&nbsp; Several days later, he was charged with the crime of rape.&nbsp; (TSN, pp. 2-26, November 12, 1980)."</blockquote>The accused-appellant raises the following assignments of errors in his brief:<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT COMMITTED THE CRIME OF RAPE THROUGH VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION.<br><br><center>II</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN GIVING MORE WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE PROSECUTION AND IN TOTALLY DISREGARDING THE EVIDENCE ADDUCED BY THE DEFENSE.<br><br><center>III</center><br>THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REA­SONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF RAPE.</blockquote>The assigned errors raised by the accused-appellant revolve around the issue of credibility of witnesses.&nbsp; A careful examination of the records shows that this case furnishes another occasion to reiterate the settled doctrine that when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, we have always accorded the highest degree of respect to the findings of the trial court.&nbsp; The lower court was in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and having observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.&nbsp; Unless the court has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value, that if considered, might affect the results of the case we do not disturb its factual findings.&nbsp; We have considered the arguments of the accused-appellant on appeal in the light of the evidence and we see no reason to depart from this established doctrine.<br><br>The defendant-appellant first questions the credibility of the offended party by pointing out that she made no outcry immediately after the defendant-appellant left their house but instead talked with the defendant-appellant who tried to comfort her.<br><br>The accused-appellant's contention has no merit.&nbsp; The 14-year old Nazarita could not have shouted immediately after the accused-appellant left their house because she and her family were under threat of death by the latter.&nbsp; She testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="11%">"Q </td><td width="89%">What else transpired between you and Eufemio Egas on that occasion? </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>He told me further that not to tell my parents because I might be mauled, or if I insist in telling my parents he will bring away from the place where I am living and kill me including my parents.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>Did you comply with the instruction given by Eufemio Egas for you not to tell your parents, otherwise, you will be brought away and killed including your parents?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td><p>&nbsp;

The complainant, consistently denied in her direct and cross-examinations that she was the sweetheart of the accused-appellant.&nbsp; She testified that although she knows Eufemio, she is not engaged nor intimately related with him.&nbsp; She testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="12%">"Q </td><td width="88%">Were you sweethearts?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> No, sir.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>The accused is your neighbor?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> Yes.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>Where?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>In Bulangog.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>He never courted you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> Never."</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(TSN., p. 3, July 2, 1979).</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr align="center"><td colspan="2"><p>xxx &nbsp;

We apply the rule laid down in <i>People v. Tumaliuan</i> (129 SCRA 682), that:<br><blockquote><center>xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</center><br>"x x x Appellant has not presented a single letter, note or any piece of evidence to support his claim that she was his sweetheart.&nbsp; Not having presented any evidence other than appellant's testimony that the act of sexual intercourse was voluntary, the declaration of the offended party, corroborated by the testimonies x x x assumes more weight and importance and to which We give full credit.&nbsp; x x x"</blockquote>Furthermore, the claim of the accused-appellant that he had several acts of sexual intercourse with Nazarita is belied by the medical findings that the complainant had only two hymenal lacerations.<br><br>Thus, the submission of the defendant-appellant that the rape charge was filed only because the complainant felt jilted when he failed to show up on the date they were supposed to get a marriage license, deserves scant consideration.&nbsp; The defendant-appellant was never the sweetheart of the complainant nor could she have agreed to marry him.&nbsp; She testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="11%">"Q </td><td width="89%">Do you want to marry him?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>No.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>Why?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>I don't love him."</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(TSN., p. 4, July 2, 1979)</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div align="center">xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>Did I get you correctly ....

Instead, she chose to undergo the rigors of a public trial which subjected her to shame and ignominy (People v.
