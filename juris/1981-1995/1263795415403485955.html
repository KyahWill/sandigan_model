				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Three young and innocent girls went to the park on a Sunday 
evening to relax and enjoy each other's company.&nbsp; Before the night was over, 
they would be brutally attacked and deflowered and seared with ugly memories 
that will probably outrage them for the rest of their lives.<br><br>These 
unfortunate girls were Rosita Rubio, fifteen years old, Constancia de los Reyes, 
fourteeen, and Rosanna Rodriguez, who was only twelve at the time.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>At about seven o'clock in the 
evening of June 22, 1972, while they were seated near the fountain at a public 
park in Lucena City, they were approached by a group of men composed of Claudio 
Veloso, Julio Dalumpienes, Renato Torres, Israel Rapote, Rey Torres, one Gerry, 
and a seventh who remains unidentified to date.&nbsp; Gerry introduced himself to 
Rosanna and then the men left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> At 10 
o'clock of the same evening, the same group was to return to the three girls in 
the park, but this time with a more malevolent purpose.<br><br>This time there 
were no amenities.&nbsp; The men surrounded the girls.&nbsp; Veloso held the hand of 
Constancia, who pushed him to the ground.&nbsp; His 8-Â½ inch bolo fell.&nbsp; Constancia 
ran but Dalumpienes caught and detained her.&nbsp; The three girls were then pulled 
by the group to the Capitol Building, their mouths covered to prevent them from 
shouting for help.&nbsp; As it happened, the lights in the park temporarily went out 
at that precise time, and nobody saw or succored them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Upon reaching the second floor of 
the building, Veloso and Renato Torres dragged Rosita to a dark corner, where 
they raped her in succession.&nbsp; Veloso threatened her with his bolo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Meanwhile, about seven meters away, 
Constancia was struggling with Dalumpienes, who subdued and violated her while 
she was being held by his two companions, who thereafter also satisfied their 
lust on her while also held by the others in turn.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Nearby, Rosanna met a similar fate from 
the seventh man in the group.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>After ravishing them, the men 
called a jeep to take the girls home but instead they proceeded directly to the 
police station, where they reported their harrowing experiences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Constancia was then taken by a policeman 
to the railroad station, where she saw and pointed to Veloso as one of her 
assailants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Veloso was arrested.&nbsp; 
After investigation, he signed an extrajudicial confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> In the morning of the following day, the 
three girls were physically examined by Dr. Imelda de Imus, who was to testify 
later that she found hymeneal lacerations in the complainants that were caused 
within the past twenty-four hours from her examination.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The above narration is based on 
the testimony of the three girls,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as 
well as the examining physician,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the 
several policemen who received the reports of the three victims and investigated 
Veloso<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and his extrajudicial 
confession.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>In his defense at 
the joint trial of the three complaints for rape filed against him and his 
companions, Veloso denied the accusations, saying he and Rosita were sweethearts 
and that they did have sexual intercourse on the night and in the place in 
question but by mutual consent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This 
is not believable.&nbsp; In the first place, he offers no evidence other than his 
self-serving statement.&nbsp; Rosita flatly rejects it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Moreover, it is not likely that, if they 
were really sweethearts, they would have had sexual intercourse only a few 
meters from where the other two girls were being violated.&nbsp; The act of love is 
not that perverse and vulgar.&nbsp; It is a private communion.&nbsp; This blatant lie, 
which would convert a brutal rape into an amorous fulfillment, does not even 
have the charm of fantasy.<br><br>The extrajudicial confession<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> is admissible against him, having been 
made before January 17, 1973, when the right to counsel was not yet in effect 
under the Magtoto doctrine.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
Significantly, he presented no medical or other evidence of his alleged 
manhandling by the police and did not complain about it to the fiscal or any 
other officer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> By contrast, the 
policemen he claimed had mauled him were presented at the trial and testified to 
deny his allegations.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Indeed, 
even if the confession were to be disregarded, the rest of the prosecution 
evidence would still be overwhelming against Veloso.&nbsp; The trial judge<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> , who had the firsthand opportunity to 
observe all the witnesses and assess their credibility, considered those for the 
prosecution more reliable, especially the complainants themselves.&nbsp; While it may 
be conceded that there were certain inconsistencies in their testimony, the tale 
they narrated of that terrible night is on the whole credible.&nbsp; The 
imperfections were on mere insignificant details that do not detract from the 
veracity of the basic accusation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> One 
could hardly expect that these three naive girls would concoct it out of pure 
imagination, implicating without reason people they did not even know, and, 
worse, exposing their own ravishment and testifying publicly on all the 
embarrassing details.<br><br>Veloso also faults the trial court for convicting 
him of the other rapes, considering that he was alleged to have raped only 
Rosita.&nbsp; The defense forgets that he is responsible also for the other rapes 
because he was a co-conspirator along with his six other companions, whose guilt 
he must also share.&nbsp; The conspiracy among them has been amply established by the 
facts that they together approached the three girls earlier that night as one of 
them introduced himself; that they returned about three hours later and without 
much ado dragged the three girls into the Capitol Building; that they 
successively raped their hapless victims, helping each other as each forced 
himself upon a victim; and that they later released the girls after they had 
satisfied their lust and sent them home in a jeep they had flagged.<br><br>A 
conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement to commit a 
crime and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> While 
it is desirable that the conspiracy be proved by direct evidence, like an 
express understanding among the plotters affirming their commitment and defining 
their respective roles, it may nevertheless be established at times by 
circumstantial evidence only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, 
to repeat established doctrine, where the accused move in concert toward a 
common purpose, conspiracy may be inferred from their joint acts and design, 
without need of direct evidence of the criminal agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> We have held in many cases that the 
conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, are 
circumstances that can show whether or not there was a conspiracy among 
them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>In a conspiracy, the 
guilt of one is the guilt of all.&nbsp; Therefore, Veloso is responsible not only for 
the rape he committed against Rosita but for all the other rapes committed by 
his companions, with whom he had conspired.&nbsp; In other words, he is liable also 
for the rape of Rosita by Renato Torres, of Constancia by Dalumpienes and two 
others, and of Rosanna by another of the conspirators, or a total of six rapes, 
including the one he actually committed.<br><br>Rape is punished with reclusion 
perpetua to death where it is committed with the use of a deadly weapon or by 
two or more persons, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> 
The trial court, appreciating the aggravating circumstance of superiority 
mitigated by voluntary surrender, imposed the penalty of life imprisonment on 
Veloso in each of the three cases filed against him, or three life 
sentences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> This was 
erroneous.<br><br>The accused-appellant did not voluntarily surrender but was in 
fact arrested at the railroad station in the morning after the rapes he and his 
companions had committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> Voluntary 
surrender should therefore not have been appreciated.&nbsp; On the other hand, the 
crime was aggravated not only by superiority but also by evident premeditation, 
which the court did not consider.&nbsp; The record shows that after approaching the 
three girls in the park at 7 o'clock of that fateful night, the same group 
returned about three hours later, obviously according to plan, and without much 
ado surrounded their victims and dragged them into the Capitol Building and 
raped them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>With the above 
aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstance, the applicable penalty 
is death, to be imposed not for each of the three victims but for each of the 
six rapes committed on them by Veloso personally and his companions.&nbsp; 
Fortunately for him, however, these six death penalties will now each have to be 
reduced to life imprisonment in accordance with Article III, Section 19(1) of 
the 1987 Constitution.<br><br>This decision affects only Claudio Veloso because 
Julio Dalumpienes, who was convicted with him, did not appeal.&nbsp; As for the 
others, we note that they have not been arrested and tried, allegedly because of 
the protection and immunity they are enjoying from the police of Lucena 
City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Let a copy of this decision be 
sent to the Chief, PC-Integrated National Police, for investigation of this 
charge.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment as above modified is AFFIRMED, 
with costs against the accused-appellant.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br>Yap, (Chairman),
