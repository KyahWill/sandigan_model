<p class="BODY">On December 20, 1990, an Amended Information was filed against
accused Virgilio "Jimmer" Bolado and accused-appellant Ernesto <span style="">Aseñas </span>for the crime of RAPE committed
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on August 26, 1990, at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning
<span style="">at </span>Sitio Cambo-ay, Barangay
Canaway, Siaton, Negros Oriental, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring and confederating
together, mutually helping each other and acting under the same accord and
purpose by means of violence and intimidation did then and there, willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with Delia Ellurig, a deaf
mute, against the latter's will and without her consent."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 9, 1991, the trial court issued an Order<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

executed on November 5, 1990 by Irenea Ellurig, mother of the victim, as the
required Complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, accused Bolado and accused-appellant <span style="">Aseñas </span>both pleaded "Not
Guilty" to the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as gathered from the evidence on record are, as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At around 6:00 a.m. of August 26, 1990, Delia Ellurig, a 17-year
old deaf-mute, went to the <span style="">Canaway </span>River
to take a bath when accused Bolado and accused-appellant Aseñas hit her head
with stones and thereafter carried her to the ground where they repeatedly
abused her for three (3) <span style="">times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon arriving </span>home,
Delia Ellurig, whose forehead was bleeding, told her mother, Irenea Ellurig,
through sign language that two persons attacked her and thereafter pointed to
her private part where the latter discovered the presence of blood in her
panties.  Immediately, the victim's
mother brought her to the Siaton District Hospital in Siaton, Negros Oriental
where her head wounds were examined and sutured by Dr. Edgar Y. Retuya and
arrived at the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Multiple Lacerated Wounds:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  Forehead, (L) measuring approximately 5 c<span style="">ms. </span>length x 0.5 cms. deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Scalp, parietal <span style="">area, </span>(L)
measuring approximately 5.5 cms. length x 0.5 cms. deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Anterior auricular area, (L) measuring approximately 3 cms. length x 0.5
cms. deep.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  Mid-forehead, measuring approximately 2 cms. length x 0.3 cms.
deep."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During trial, Dr. Edgar Retuya confirmed that Delia Ellurig is a
mute and testified that the lacerated head wounds could have been caused by
stones with sharp edges which were violently struck upon Delia Ellurig and
might have caused her to lose consciousness.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 3, 1990, Dr. Portia Pauline P. Hachuela examined
Delia Ellurig, who was still confined in the same hospital, and arrived at the
following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Genitalia:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Labia Majora - Negative Pertinent
Findings</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Labia Minora - Negative Pertinent
Findings</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Vagina - Admits 2 Fingers Easily</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hymen - Healed Laceration at 6
o'clock &amp; 7 o'clock positions."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Hachuela testified that when she conducted Delia Ellurig's
internal examination, there was evidence of recent penetration on the vagina of
Delia Ellurig and the hymenal laceration could have been caused by the entry of
an erect penis, which laceration can heal in one to two weeks’ time.  However, she was unable to examine the
presence of spermatozoa in Delia Ellurig's vagina because the latter resisted.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence was further corroborated by Diomedes
Quirit who testified that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x on August 26, 1990, at about 6:00 A.M. at Barangay
Canaway, Siaton Negros Oriental, x x x [he] went to the Canaway river to
retrieve his shrimp traps.  While he was
wading through a shallow portion of the river, he saw the defendants and Delia
Ellurig on the river, about twenty five (25) meters away from him.  As Delia Ellurig was being wrestled by the
two (2) defendants, he moved back to the ground and hid behind a 'colon-colon'
tree about two (2) feet from the edge of the river.  From behind the tree, he saw Jimmer Bolado struck [sic] Delia
with a stone twice on the forehead.  Ernesto Aseñas also struck her with a stone hitting her head.  Diomedes saw blood oozing from Delia's
forehead and she became weak, apparently unconscious.  The two (2) defendants then lifted and carried Delia to the
ground and laid her on a spot about four (4) feet from the river bank.  Her dress (blouse) was down to her waistline
only.  She had no panty.  Her scarce pubic hair was visible.  In carrying Delia, Ernesto held her arms,
while Jimmer held Delia's two (2) legs which were spread like the handles of a
wheelbarrow.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jimmy Bolado then took off his brown-colored brief.  His penis was visible.  He then mounted himself on top of Delia and
executed pumping movements of his buttocks.  Simultaneously, Ernesto was busy massaging Delia's breast and kissing
her.  After Jimmer finished with his
carnal act with her, Ernesto removed his blue-colored brief, exposing his
penis, and placed himself on top of Delia.  He likewise made pumping movements of his buttocks while on top of
Delia.  While Ernesto was having sexual
intercourse with her, Jimmy Bolado was also kissing Delia's breast.  After Ernesto dismounted, Jimmer Bolado
placed himself for the second time on top of Delia and executed again pumping
motions of his buttocks.  <span style="">At </span>this juncture, Diomedes Quirit left
the vicinity.  He reported what he just
witnessed to his parents.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, accused-appellant Aseñas, however, denied raping
Delia Ellurig and maintained that on August 26, 1990, he was at his house being
treated by an "ambolario" named Vicenta (Dodo) Paera called by his
father as he was suffering from severe headache and high fever for almost a
week.  Additionally, he attributed
ulterior motives on the part of Diomedes Quirit when the latter testified
against him as he had caused the eventual arrest of Diomedes Quirit after
reporting the latter to the police authorities for being an active member of
the NPA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1992, the trial court rejected the defenses proffered
by accused-appellant and rendered its decision the dispositive portion of which
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds accused
Virgilio "Jimmer" Bolado and Ernesto Aseñas guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of three (3) distinct crimes of rape penalized under Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code as amended.  By
reason of the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, accused Virgilio
"Jimmer" Bolado is hereby sentenced, after applying the Indeterminate
Sentence Law, to three (3) indeterminate prison terms ranging from 12 years of
prision mayor as minimum to 20 years of reclusion temporal as maximum together
with all the accessory penalties provided for by law.  Not being entitled to any mitigating circumstance, accused Ernesto
Aseñas is hereby sentenced to three (3) prison terms of reclusion perpetua
together with all the accessory penalties provided for by law.  For both accused, the prison terms imposed
herein shall be served successively, subject however to the three-fold rule
which in no case shall the total exceed 40 years in accordance with Art. 70 of
the Revised Penal Code as amended by Com. Act No. 217 (P. v. Sendaydiego, 81
SCRA 147).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both defendants are ordered to pay jointly in equal shares
the victim, thru her parents, the sum of P50,000.00 as moral damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The jailer is hereby ordered to make the proper reduction of
the period during which the defendants were under preventive custody by reason
of this case in accordance with law.”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his bid for the reversal of said decision, accused-appellant
assails the guilty verdict on the ground of want of jurisdiction by the trial
court over the case as the Information was defective having been filed only by
the mother of the offended party and not by the offended party herself as
required under the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraphs 3 and 4, Section 5 of Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of
Court provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape or acts of
lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the
offended party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if
the offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named persons, as the
case may be.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Where the
offended party who is a minor fails to file the complaint, her parents,
grandparents, or guardian may file the same.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question, therefore, that the mother of the offended
party may file the complaint in behalf of the offended party if the latter is
still a minor.  In the instant case,
Delia Ellurig was only 17 years old when she was raped by accused-appellant and
his co-accused Jimmer Bolado.  Thus, the
complaint for rape filed by the mother of the offended party is deemed to be
sufficient compliance with the requirement of the law.  Besides, the records revealed that the
offended party subsequently signed the complaint during the pre-trial
stage.  Moreover, the enunciated
doctrine is that it is not the complaint of the offended party in rape cases
and the other private offenses enumerated in Article 344 of the Revised Penal
Code which confers jurisdiction on the Court.  The complaint required by said Article is merely a condition precedent
to the exercise by the proper authorities of the power to prosecute the guilty parties.  It is the Judiciary Law that vests
jurisdiction on the Courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the credibility of the witnesses, this Court finds no
compelling reason to disturb the findings of the trial court since the latter
is in a better position to decide the issue of credibility of prosecution
witnesses having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during trial, unless certain facts of substance and value have
been plainly overlooked which, if considered, might affect the result of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant’s insinuation that his implication in this case
by prosecution witness Diomedes Quirit was motivated by revenge in trying to
get even with him for allegedly reporting said witness to the police
authorities as an NPA member, is incredible to say the least.  Other than his assertion to that effect, no
corroborating evidence was ever presented to prove it.  In imputing ulterior motives to Diomedes
Quirit, accused-appellant hopes to convince this Court that the charges filed
against him are fabricated.  The rule is
well settled that in the absence of evidence to show that the witnesses for the
prosecution were actuated by improper motive, the identification of the
accused-appellant <span style="">as </span>the
assailant should be given full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> As
correctly pointed out by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court has no reason to doubt Diomedes Quirit's
story.  At the time of the incident on
August 26, 1990, he was barely 17 years old.  He immediately told his parents about the beastial attack upon the person
and honor of Delia but not to the authorities for the reason that the two
defendants are his uncles.  It was only
on November 1, 1990, at the Cambo-ay market day, that he told Barangay Lupon
Ireneo Ejera about the incident, when the latter asked him about it.  He decided to reveal the truth, as according
to him, he was bothered by his conscience.  Delia, although already a deaf-mute, was his classmate in Grade III.  It was Ireneo Ejera, who in turn, told
Delia's parents about what Quirt related to him.  Subsequently, he was investigated by the police and his affidavit
was taken on November 5, 1990 (Exh. "B, B-1 and B-1?A").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is unfortunate that the victim Delia Ellurig cannot, by
herself, testify on the outrage she suffered.  She would have been the best witness to narrate the details of the
sexual assault upon her.  But this
circumstance does not diminish[ed] the strength of the prosecution's
evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant's defense of alibi is much too weak
and incredible against prosecution witnesses' positive identification of
accused-­appellant as the co-conspirator of raping Delia Ellurig on that
fateful morning.  The denial made and
the alibi advanced by the accused-appellant cannot prevail over his positive
identification and that of his companion, Jimmer Bolado, by the prosecution
witnesses.  It has been stated time and
time again that for the defense of alibi to prosper, it must be established by
clear and convincing evidence that the accused was at some other place for such
a period of time <span style="">as </span>would negate
his presence at the time and place where the crime was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court correctly held that:</p>

<blockquote>"As to accused Ernesto Aseñas' alibi, no evidence was also
adduced by him to show that it was physically impossible for him to be at the
scene of the crime at that time it was committed.  At the time of the incident, he was residing at Luan-luan,
Canaway, which is in the same barangay where the rape took place.  Even if it is true that he was sick with
headache and fever, there are persons, especially those who are still young and
able-bodied who can engage in some normal human activities, even if they have a
headache.  Hence, there was no physical
impossibility for Ernesto Aseñas to be at the Canaway river in the early
morning of August 26, 1990."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that during the trial of the case,
Delia Ellurig, on two separate occasions, pointed at accused-appellant and his
co-accused as the two (2) persons who had attacked and raped her.</p>

<p class="BODY">We quote, in the proceedings in the court below:</p>

<blockquote>"During the trial on October 10,
