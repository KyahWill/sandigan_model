of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Seventh
Judicial District, Branch III, in Civil Case No. 3518, dismissing appellant's
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, the antecedent facts of the case are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1955">January 14, 1955</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas executed their Articles of
Co-Partnership (Exhibit "A") called <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises (EDE) with only the two of them as partners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partnership <st1:city><st1:place>EDE</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="BODY">One of the purposes of the duly-registered partnership was to
“apply or secure timber and/or minor forests products licenses and concessions
over public and/or private forest lands and to operate, develop and promote
such forests rights <span style="">and concessions.” </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 114)</p>

<p class="BODY">A duly registered Articles of Co-Partnership was filed together
with an application for a timber concession covering the <span style="">area </span>located at <span class="SpellE">Cateel</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baganga</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
with the Bureau of Forestry which was approved and Timber License No. 35-56 was
duly issued and became the basis of subsequent renewals made for and in behalf
of the duly registered partnership <st1:city><st1:place>EDE</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the said Articles
of Co-Partnership, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
shall manage the business affairs of the partnership, including marketing and
handling of cash and is authorized to sign all papers and instruments relating
to the partnership, while appellant Rojas shall be the logging superintendent
and shall manage the logging operations of the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is <span style="">also p</span>rovided in the said articles of co-partnership that all
profits and losses of the partnership shall <span style="">be divided share and share alike between the partners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the period from </span><st1:date month="1" day="14" year="1955"><span style="">January

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Because </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the difficulties encountered, Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
decided to </span><span style="">avail </span><span style="">of the services of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
as industrial partner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="3" day="4" year="1956"><span style="">March 4,
 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, Rojas and Agustin <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
executed their Articles of Co-Partnership (Exhibit "B" and Exhibit

purpose of the second </span><span style="">partnership
</span><span style="">which is to hold and </span><span style="">secure </span><span style="">renewal of timber license instead of to secure the license as in the
first partnership and the term of </span><span style="">the
</span><span style="">second partnership is fixed to
thirty (30) years, everything else is the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="GramE">partnership
formed by <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
and Rojas started operation on </span></span><st1:date year="1956" day="1" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="">May 1, 1956</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, and was able to ship logs

the logs in the sum of P643<span class="GramE">,633.07</span> (Decision, R.A.
919).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On October 25, 1956, <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas
executed a document entitled "CONDITIONAL SALE OF INTEREST IN THE
PARTNERSHIP, EASTCOAST DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISES" (Exhibits "C"
and "D") agreeing among themselves that <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
and Rojas shall purchase the interest, share and participation </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the Partnership of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> assessed in the
amount of P31,501.12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also agreed
in the said instrument that after payment of the sum of P31,501.12 to <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> including the amount of loan secured by <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> in favor of the partnership, the two (<span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas) shall become the owners of all equipment
contributed by <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> and the EASTCOAST
DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISES, the name also given to the second partnership, be
dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
was paid in full on August 31, 1957.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
other rights and obligations accrued in the name of the second partnership
(R.A. 921).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>, the partnership was continued by <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas without the benefit of any written
agreement or reconstitution of their written Articles of Partnership (Decision,
R.A. 948).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 28, 1957, Rojas entered into a management contract with
another logging enterprise, the CMS Estate, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left and abandoned the partnership
(Decision, R.A. 947).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 4, 1957,
Rojas withdrew his equipment from the partnership for use in the newly acquired
area (Decision, R.A. 948).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The equipment withdrawn
were </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">supposed contributions to the first
partnership and was transferred to CMS Estate, Inc. by way of chattel mortgage
(Decision, R.A. p. 948).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 17, 1957, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> wrote Rojas reminding the latter of his obligation
to contribute, either in cash or in equipment, to the capital investments of
the </span>partnership as well as his obligation to perform his duties as
logging superintendent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Two weeks after March 17,
1957, Rojas told <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> that he will not be able to
comply with the promised contributions and he will not work as </span>logging <span style="">superintendent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> then told
Rojas that the latter's share will just be</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">20% of the net
profits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Such was the sharing
from 1957 to 1959 without complaint or dispute (Decision, R.A. 949).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, Rojas took
funds from the partnership more than his contribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in a letter dated February 21, 1961
(Exhibit “10”) <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> notified Rojas that he
dissolved the partnership (R.A. 949).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 7, 1961, Rojas
filed an action before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> for the recovery of properties,
accounting, receivership and damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 3518 (Record
on </span>Appeal, pp. 1-26).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Rojas’ petition for
appointment of a receiver </span><span style="">was </span>denied
(R.A. 894).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon motion of Rojas on
May 23, 1961, Judge Romero appointed commissioners to examine the long and
voluminous accounts </span>of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises </span>(<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
<span style="">894-895).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The motion to dismiss the
complaint filed by <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> on June 21, 1961 (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 102-114) was denied by Judge Romero for want of merit (<u>Ibid</u>., </span><span style="">p. </span><span style="">125).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Romero also required
the inclusion of the entire year 1961 in the report to be submitted by the
commissioners (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 138-143).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the commissioners started examining the records and supporting
papers of the partnership as well as the information furnished them by the
parties, which were compiled in three (3) volumes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 11, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> filed his motion for leave of court to amend his
answer with counterclaim attaching thereto the amended answer (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 26?336), which was granted on May 22, 1964 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 336).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On May 27, 1964, Judge
M.G. Reyes approved the submitted Commissioners’ Report (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 337).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On June 29, 1965, Rojas filed
his motion for reconsideration of the order dated May 27, 1964 approving the
report of the commissioners which was opposed by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 19, 1964,
appellant's motion for reconsideration was denied (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 446-451).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A mandatory pre-trial was
conducted on September 8 and 9, 1964 and the following issues were agreed upon </span><span style="">to be </span><span style="">submitted to the </span><span style="">trial </span><span style="">court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nature of partnership and the legal
relations of <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas after the dissolution
of the second partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their sharing basis:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether in proportion to their contribution
or share and share alike;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ownership of properties bought <span style="">by </span><span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> <span style="">in his </span>wife’s name;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The damages suffered and who should be liable
for them; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal effect of the letter dated February
23, 1961 of <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> dissolving the partnership
(Decision, R. A. pp. 895-896).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered its decision on March <span style="">11, </span>1968, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the above facts and issues duly considered,
judgment is hereby rendered by the Court declaring that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the partnership and the legal
relations of <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas after <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> retired from the second partnership, that is,
after August 31,<span style=""> </span>1957, when <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> was finally paid his share - the partnership of
the defendant and the plaintiff is one of a <u><span style="">de</span></u><span style=""> <u>facto</u></span>
and at will;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the sharing of partnership profits
should be on the basis of computation, that is the ratio and proportion of
their respective contributions, or on the basis of share and share alike - this
covered by actual contributions of the plaintiff and the defendant and by their
verbal agreement; that the sharing of profits and losses is on the basis of
actual contributions; that from 1957 to 1959, the sharing is on the basis of
80% for the defendant and 20% for the plaintiff of the profits, but from 1960
to the date of dissolution, February 23, 1961, the plaintiff's share will be on
the basis of his actual contribution and, considering his indebtedness to the
partnership, the plaintiff is not entitled to any share in the profits of the
said partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to whether the properties which were
bought by the defendant and placed in his or in his wife's name were acquired
with partnership funds or with funds of the defendant and - the Court declares
that there is no evidence that these properties were acquired the partnership
funds, and therefore the same should not belong to the partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to whether damages were suffered and, if
so, how much, and who caused them and who should be liable for them - the Court
declares that neither parties is entitled to damages, for as already stated
above it is not a wise policy to place a price on the right of a person to
litigate and/or to come to Court for the assertion of the rights they believe
they are entitled to;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to what is the legal effect <span style="">of </span>the letter of defendant to the
plaintiff dated February 23, 1961; did it dissolve the partnership or not - the
Court declares that the letter of the defendant<span style=""> to </span>the plaintiff dated February 23, 1961, in effect dissolved
the partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Court relative to the canteen,
which sells foodstuffs,<span style=""> supplies, </span>and
other merchandise to the laborers and employees of the <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span>
Development Enterprises, - the COURT <span style="">DECLARES
TH</span>E<span style=""> SAME </span>AS NOT BELONGING
TO THE PARTNERSHIP;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the alleged sale of forest concession
Exhibit '9-B' executed by Pablo Angeles David - is VALID AND BINDING UPON THE
PARTIES AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF MAGLANA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE
PARTNERSHIP;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the Court orders and directs
plaintiff Rojas to pay or turn over to the partnership the amount of P69,000.00
the profits he received from the CMS Estate, Inc. operated by him;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim that plaintiff Rojas should be
ordered to pay the further sum of P85,000.00 which according to him he is still
entitled to receive from the CMS Estate, Inc. is hereby denied considering that
it has not yet been actually received, and further the receipt is merely based
upon an expectancy and/or still speculative;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court also directs and orders plaintiff
Rojas to pay the sum of P62,988.19 his personal account to the partnership;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“11.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court also credits the defendant the
amount of P85,000.00 the amount he should have received as logging
superintendent, and which was not paid to him, and this should be considered as
part of <span class="SpellE">Maglana's</span> contribution likewise to the
partnership; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complaint is hereby dismissed with costs
against the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.” (Decision, Record on Appeal, p<span style="">p. 9</span>85-989).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rojas interposed the instant appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is the nature of the partnership and
legal relationship of the <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>-Rojas after <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> retired from the second partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court is of the view that the second partnership
superseded the first, so that when the second partnership was dissolved there
was no written contract of co-partnership; there was no reconstitution as
provided for in the <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> partnership contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the partnership which <span style="">was </span>carried on by Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> after the dissolution of the second partnership was
a <u>de</u> <u><span style="">f</span></u><u><span style="">acto</span></u><span style=""> </span>partnership and at will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="">was </span>considered as a
partnership at will because there was no term, express or implied; no period
was fixed, expressly or impliedly (Decision, R.A. pp. 962-963).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Rojas insists that the registered partnership
under the firm name of <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development
Enterprises (EDE) evidenced by the Articles of Co-Partnership dated January 14,
1955 (Exhibit "A") has not been <span class="SpellE">novated</span>,
superseded and/or dissolved by the unregistered articles of co-partnership
among appellant Rojas, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
and Agustin <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>, dated March 4, 1956 (Exhibit
“C”) and accordingly, the terms and stipulations of said registered Articles of
Co-Partnership (Exhibit "A") should govern the relations between him
and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon withdrawal of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> from the
unregistered partnership (Exhibit "C"), the legally constituted partnership
EDE (Exhibit "A") continues to govern the relations between them and
it was legal error to consider a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> partnership between
said two partners or a partnership at will.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the letter of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">MagIana</span> dated February 23, 1961, did not legally dissolve
the registered partnership between them, being in contravention of the
partnership agreement agreed upon and stipulated in their Articles of
Co-Partnership (Exhibit "A").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, appellant is entitled to the rights enumerated in Article 1837
of the Civil Code and to the sharing profits between them of "share and
share alike" as stipulated in the registered Articles of Co-Partnership
(Exhibit "A").</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the records as against the conflicting
claims of Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, it appears evident that
it was not the intention of the partners to dissolve the first partnership,
upon the constitution of the second one, which they unmistakably called an
“Additional Agreement” (Exhibit "9-B") (Brief for Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, pp. 24-25).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Except for the fact that they took in one industrial partner;<span style=""> </span>gave him an equal share in the profits
and fixed the term of the second partnership to thirty 30 years, everything
else was the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they adopted
the same name, EASTCOAST DEVELOPMENT ENTERPRISES, they pursued the same
purposes and the capital contributions of Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
as stipulated in both partnerships call for the same amounts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as important is the fact that all
subsequent renewals of Timber License No. 35-36 were secured in favor of the
First Partnership, the original licensee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To all intents and purposes therefore, the First Articles of Partnership
were only amended, in the form of Supplementary Articles of Co-Partnership
(Exhibit “C”) which was never registered (Brief for Plaintiff-Appellant, p.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, even during the
existence of the second partnership, all business transactions were carried out
under the duly registered articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the trial court, it is an admitted fact that even up to now, there are
still subsisting obligations and contracts of the latter (Decision, R.A. pp.
950-957).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No rights and obligations
accrued in the name of the second partnership except in favor of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> which was fully paid by the duly registered
partnership (Decision, R.A., pp. 919-921).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is no dispute that the second
partnership was dissolved by common consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said dissolution did not affect the first partnership which continued to
exist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> and Rojas agreed to purchase the interest, share
and participation in the second partnership of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
and that thereafter, the two (<span class="SpellE"><span style="">M</span>aglana</span> and Rojas) became the owners of equipment
contributed by <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even more convincing, is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> on March 17, 1957, wrote Rojas, reminding the
latter of his obligation to contribute either in cash or in equipment, to the
capital investment of the partnership as well as his obligation to perform his
duties as logging superintendent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
reminder cannot refer to any other but to the provisions of the duly registered
Articles of Co-Partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier
stated, Rojas replied that he will not be able to comply with the promised
contributions and he <span style="">will </span>not
work as logging superintendent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such
statements, it is obvious that <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> understood what <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> was referring to and left no room for doubt that
both considered themselves governed by the articles of the duly registered
partnership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, the relationship of Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> after the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>
can neither be considered as a <u>De</u> <u>Facto</u><span style=""> </span>Partnership, nor a Partnership At Will, for as stressed, there
is an existing <span style="">partnership, </span>duly
registered.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
can unilaterally dissolve the partnership in the case at bar, the answer is in
the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, as there are only two parties when <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
notified Rojas that he dissolved the partnership, it is in effect a notice of
withdrawal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 1830, par. 2 of the Civil Code, even if there is a
specified term, one partner can cause its dissolution by expressly withdrawing
even before the expiration of the period, with or without justifiable
cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, if the cause is not
justified or no cause was given, the withdrawing partner is liable for damages
but in no case can he be compelled to remain in the firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his withdrawal, the number of members is
decreased, hence, the dissolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
in whatever way we<span style=""> </span>may view the
situation, the conclusion is inevitable that Rojas and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>
shall be guided in the liquidation of the partnership by the provisions of its
duly registered Articles of Co-Partnership:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that is, all profits and losses of the partnership shall be divided
"share and share alike" between the partners.</p>

<p class="BODY">But an accounting must first be made and which in fact was
ordered by the trial court and accomplished by the commissioners appointed for
the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the Commissioners' Report, the corresponding
contribution of the partners from 1956-1961 are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eufracio</span> Rojas who
should have contributed P158,158.00, contributed only P18,750.00 while <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> who should have contributed P160,984.00,
contributed P267,541.44 (Decision, R.A. p. 976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a settled rule that when a partner who
has undertaken to contr<span style="">i</span>bute a
sum of money fails to do so, he becomes a debtor of the partnership for
whatever he may have promised to contribute (Article 1786, Civil Code) and for
interests and damages from the time he should have complied with his obligation
(Article 1788, Civil Code) (Moran, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, 133 SCRA 94
[1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being a<span style=""> </span>contract of partnership, each partner must share in the profits
and losses of the venture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
essence of a partnership (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 95).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus<span style="">,</span> as reported
in the Commissioners' Report, Rojas is not entitled to any profits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their voluminous reports which was
approved by the trial court, they showed that on 50-50% basis, Rojas will be
liable in the amount of P131,166.00; on 80-20%, he will be liable <span style="">for </span>P40,092.96 and finally on the
basis of actual capital contribution, he will be liable for P52,040.31.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, except as to the legal relationship of the partners
after the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span> which is
unquestionably a continuation of the duly registered partnership and the sharin<span style="">g</span> of profits and losses which should be
on the basis of share and share alike as provided for <span style="">in </span>the duly registered Articles of Co-Partnership, no plausible
reason could be found to disturb the findings and conclusions of the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> is liable for
damages because of such withdrawal, it will be recalled that after the
withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">Pahamotang</span>, Rojas entered into a
management contract with another logging enterprise, the CMS Estate, Inc., a
company engaged in the same business as the partnership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He withdrew his equipment, refused to
contribute either in cash or in equipment to the capital investment and to
perform his duties as logging superintendent, as stipulated in their partnership
agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records also show that
Rojas not only abandoned the partnership but also took funds in an amount more
than his contribution (Decision, R.A., p.<span style="">
</span>949).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the given situation <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> cannot
be said to be <span style="">in </span>bad faith nor
can he be liable for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the assailed decision of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Branch III, is hereby
MODIFIED in the sense that the duly registered partnership of <span class="SpellE">Eastcoast</span> Development Enterprises continued to exist<span style=""> </span>until liquidated and that the sharing
basis of the partners should be on share and share alike as provided for <span style="">in </span>its Articles of Partnership, in
accordance with the computation of the commissioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also hereby AFFIRM the decision of the
