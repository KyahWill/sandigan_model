approached the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told the
latter that he was being called by Maj. <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span>,
the Police Station Commander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused inquired (why) and the policemen answered that he would know the reason
from Maj. <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span> himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused said he was not able to finish his snack because
the policemen held and told him that they were in a hurry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused boarded on the tricycle and
brought to the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Police Station but he was not
presented to Maj. <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Instead, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> took out
dried marijuana leaves wrapped in a newspaper from his wallet and told the
accused to admit possession thereof which the accused denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of his denial the accused was placed
inside the jail.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused-admitted that he was not manhandled by the
policemen nor was any form of physical violence applied on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he learned on that same day that
he was being charged for selling marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused further admitted that prior to the incident there
was no quarrel between him and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>; or Pat.

<p class="BODY">From the judgment of conviction, accused-appellant interposed
this appeal raising the following assignment of errors allegedly committed by
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote><b><span style="">I.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in giving weight and
credence to the contradicting and improbable testimony of prosecution witness
Pfc. Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> and disregarding the defense of
the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">II.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in admitting in
evidence the dried marijuana fruiting tops wrapped in a newspaper (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D") which was obtained in violation of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> constitutional rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">III.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in not holding that the
prosecution miserably failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a
reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the accused-appellant, self?contradiction
tainted the testimony of the prosecution witness Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>.
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>On direct examination, he testified that
he did not know yet the name of the person whom he approached to buy the
prohibited stuff but that his informer pointed to the accused as the person
from whom he can buy the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
asked by the court, however, he said that nobody pointed to the accused as a
pusher of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's brief
also pointed out the contradicting testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> testified that the initials on the P10.00 bill
used as buy-bust money was placed after the arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony, however, was contradicted by <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Jaeda</span>, the
"officer-in-the-case," who testified also on cross-examination that
the initials and other markings on the same P10.00 bill was placed before the operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his brief, opined that when Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> said he did not know the subject of their
buy-bust, he actually meant that <u>he</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>know</u> <u>his</u>
<u>name</u> <u>yet</u> but knew him to be appellant because of the way he was
dressed; that his confidential informer was able to describe him before the
buy-bust but was not able to tell his name and that neither was the informer at
the scene where the buy bust operation was conducted to point accused-appellant
to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue before Us boils down to the credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule that findings of the trial court on the
issue of credibility of <span class="SpellE">witnessess</span> and their
testimonies are entitled to great respect and accorded the highest
consideration by appellate courts (People v. <span class="SpellE">Lati</span>,
G.R. No. 70393, April 17, 1990, 184 SCRA 336 citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No. 81520, February 21, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule however, is not without exceptions,
as when:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) the conclusion is a finding
grounded entirely on speculations, surmises and conjectures; 2) the inference
made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; 3) there is grave abuse of
discretion; 4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; and 5) the
court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same
are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (Gomez v. IAC, 135 SCRA 620; Republic v. CA, 132
SCRA 514; Carolina Industries Inc. v. CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. 97 SCRA 734,

<p class="BODY">We have gone through the record and the <span style="">transcript of stenographic notes of the trial court and We believe that
the prosecution on failed </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">establish the guilt of the accused-appellant

<p class="BODY">While Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> testified that
they conducted a surveillance a week before they actually conducted the buy
bust operation, they had not identified any body as their subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his direct testimony, he said that he did
not yet know from whom they were going to buy marijuana and it was his informer
who pointed to the accused-appellant as a pusher of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, however, Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> testified that <span style="">the </span>only reason why he picked on the accused-appellant was
because he was the only person in the hall wearing <span class="SpellE">maong</span>
pants and sleeveless T-shirt.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no indication nor information that prior to the arrest
of the accused-appellant he was a known drug-pusher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, there was no indication that after
a surveillance of the target area was conducted by the police officers, the
accused was already identified and marked as a person peddling marijuana and
whose arrest was sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In buy-bust
operations, a surveillance is usually conducted to identify a drug-pusher who
would be the subject of the entrapment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other cases of buy-bust operations, the police team who conducts the
operation does so after a reliable informant point to a particular place where
the sale of the prohibited drugs by notorious drug pusher is rampant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the police team who allegedly
entrapped the accused-appellant went to the billiard hall and accosted the
latter because of the clothes he was wearing and as an afterthought, because he
was allegedly pointed to by a police informer as being <span style="">a</span> drug pusher.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is aware that the commission of the offense of illegal
sale of marijuana requires merely the consummation of the selling
transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important that the
poseur-buyer received the marijuana from the accused (People v. <span class="SpellE">Dekingco</span>, G.R. No. 87685, Sept. 13, 1990, 189 SCRA 512,
People v. Fernandez, et al., G.R. No. 80481, June 27, 1990; People v. De la
Cruz and Beltran, G.R. No. 83260, April 18, 1990, 184 SCRA 416).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, courts should not accept <span class="SpellE">hookline</span> and sinker, the testimony of the alleged
poseur-buyer that he was able to buy the prohibited drug from the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the very nature <span style="">of </span>anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment
procedures, the use of shady characters as informants, the ease with which
sticks of marijuana or grams of heroine can be planted in pockets or hands of
unsuspecting provincial hicks and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug
deals, the possibility of abuse is great (People <span style="">v. </span>Ale, G.R. No. L-70998, <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1986</st1:date>, 145 SCRA 50).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the gravity of the penalty for
this offense, courts should be careful in receiving and believing the testimony
of the alleged poseur-buyer especially when none of his teammates were
presented to corroborate his story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have in many cases (People v. <span class="SpellE">Fernanda</span>, 145 SCRA 151;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Lati</span>, G.R. No. 70393, April 17, 1990, 184
SCRA 336; People v. <span class="SpellE">Yatuc</span>, 188 SCRA 1) expressed Our
reservations on the propriety of buy-bust operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We held in these cases that the common <u>modus</u>
<u>operandi</u> of [anti]-narcotic agents of utilizing poseur-buyers does not
always commend itself as the most reliable way to go after violators of the
Dangerous Drugs Act as it is susceptible to mistake, harassment, extortion and
abuse.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worthy to note that on direct examination Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> testified that the markings on the ten peso
(P10.00) bill were written by the officer-on-the case, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jeada</span> (TSN, p. 18), <u>after</u> the arrest of the
accused-appellant (TSN, p. 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
<span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Jeada</span>, testified on
direct examination that the markings on the bill were written by the arresting
officer, Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> (TSN, p. 24) before the
buy-bust operations (TSN, p. 25).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inconsistency in the testimony of two (2) principal prosecution witnesses had
not been explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Jeada</span> is important to corroborate <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>
testimony, at least, to confirm the latter's claim that the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>
Police Force had in fact planned and set out the details of the buy-bust
operation where the accused?appellant was allegedly caught <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out however, <span class="SpellE">Jeada's</span>
testimony tended to cast a cloud on the veracity of the material witness'
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In several cases, We held that the testimony of a single witness,
if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court as to the guilt of the
accused beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict (People v. Consuelo,
184 SCRA 406; People v. Javier, G.R. No. 70997, February 28, 1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, We are not convinced
of the veracity of the testimony of Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>
that the accused-appellant was caught <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony was characterized by
inconsistencies, indirectness and sometimes uncertainties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense witnesses were more direct and
straight-forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellant
testified that on that same afternoon, he was in a store about 70-80 meters
away from their house, taking a snack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
tricycle ridden by two (2) policemen <span style="">arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they alighted, they approached the
accused-appellant and asked him to go with them because a certain Major <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Police
would like to talk to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
brought to the police station but he was not presented to Major <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span> took out marijuana
from his wallet, presented it to the accused and asked him to admit ownership
of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, he did not admit
ownership of the marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further
testified that he was not allowed to go home but instead, he was locked up in
jail at the third floor of the police building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was not investigated until the next day, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="8"><span style="">August 18, 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> before Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Franchito</span>
Diamante.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">He </span><span style="">was able to identify
one </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the policemen who brought him to the police
station as Jose <span class="SpellE">Apruebo</span> because the latter was once a
"standby" in their place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the accused that he was merely taking a snack in
a sari-sari store when the police officers invited him to the police station
was corroborated by the store owner, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Tumambing</span>,
also the <span class="SpellE">Kagawad</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Lupong</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagapamayapa</span> in the place
(TSN, p. 56).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tumambing</span>
also testified that he did not see that the police officer search the body of
the accused.</p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, did you learned (sic) why Jerome was
there?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did you come to know the reason
why he was detained in the municipal jail of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>
Police on <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1988</st1:date>?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was also from the police <span style="">at </span>the gate of the jail who told me
that Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span> was really detained because of
marijuana, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was there anything recovered from Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span>
during that time that the two (2) policemen approached him at your store on
August 17, 1988 while the accused Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span> was
taking his snack at your store?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Up to now, I am still asking myself <span style="">why </span>the police would detain him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because why (sic) they approached Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span> at my store, they did not search his body and they
did not tell to Jerome that he was being arrested <span style="">for </span>any violation of law and that is what I also tell (sic) <span style="">to </span>the wife of Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span> upon reaching back home from the police station,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You mean to say, at the time the police
approached him, nothing was said to him<span style=""> </span>except
that Major <span class="SpellE">Montefalcon</span> was inviting him and he also
wanted to see and talk to Jerome?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And, did they show Jerome any warrant of
arrest or search warrant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing was shown to him, sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They never searched his body, the meeting was
very casual." (p. 57, TSN)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is a common presumption applied in cases involving
violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act of regular performance of duty by police
officers conducting buy-bust operations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the police officers had no motive in testifying falsely against the
accused or when no physical violence or harm was applied to the accused, courts
are bent on upholding the presumption of regularity of performance of duty by
police officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, We also held
in People v. Ale, G.R. No. 708998, October 14, 1986, 145 SCRA 60 that the
presumption that official duty (is) regularly performed cannot, by itself,
prevail against the constitutional presumption of innocence accorded an accused
person.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the lone testimony of Benny <span class="SpellE">Iglesias</span>
as regards what actually happened during the alleged buy-bust was belied not
only by the accused but also by the owner of the store where the accused was,
according to both of them (accused and storeowner), taking a snack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The store owner who was also a <span class="SpellE">Lupon</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagapamayapa</span>
had no reason to favor the accused or perjure himself to shield an alleged
drug-pusher, if it were true.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
is REVERSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant,
Jerome <span class="SpellE">Honrada</span> is ACQUITTED of the crime charged on
grounds of reasonable doubt.</p>
