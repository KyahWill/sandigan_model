This is an appeal by Malayan Insurance Company, Inc.  (MALAYAN) from a 
decision of Court of First Instance of Manila ordering it to pay the 
insured under a car insurance policy issued by MALAYAN to Daniel Stephen
 Adolfson against own damage as well as third party liability.
<p>
The facts are not in dispute.  Adolfson had a subsisting MALAYAN car 
insurance policy with the above coverage on November 23, 1969 when his 
car collided with a car owned by Cesar Poblete, resulting in damage to 
both vehicles.  At the time of the accident, Adolfson's car was being 
driven by James Stokes, who was authorized to do so by Adolfson.  
Stokes, an Irish citizen who had been in the Philippines as a tourist 
for more than ninety days, had a valid and subsisting Irish driver's 
License but without a Philippine driver's license.
</p><p>
After the collision, Adolfson filed a claim with MALAYAN but the latter 
refused to pay, contending that Stokes was not an authorized driver 
under the "Authorized Driver" clause of the insurance policy in relation
 to Section 21 of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.
</p><p>
Under the insurance policy, "authorized driver" refers to –
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(a)  The insured </p>
  <p> "(b)  Any person driving on the insured's order or with his permission. </p>
  <p> "PROVIDED that the person driving is permitted in accordance with 
the licensing or other laws or regulations to drive the motor vehicle 
and is not disqualified from driving such motor vehicle by order of a 
court of law or by reason of any enactment or regulation in that 
behalf."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The cited Section 21 of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "<em>Operation of motor vehicles by tourists</em>.  - Bona fide 
tourists and similar transients who are duly licensed to operate motor 
vehicles in their respective countries may be allowed to operate motor 
vehicles during <em>but not after  ninety days of then sojourn in the Philippines</em>. </p>
  <p align="center">
    x        x         x          x
  </p>
  <p> "After ninety days, any tourist or transient desiring to operate 
motor vehicles shall pay fees and obtain and carry a license as 
hereinafter pro­vided." (Italics supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Unable to convince MALAYAN to pay, Stokes and Adolfson brought suit 
before the Court of First Instance of Manila and succeeded in getting a 
favorable judgment, although Stokes had ceased to be authorized to drive
 a motor vehicle in the Philippines at the time of the accident, he 
having stayed therein as a tourist for over 90 days without having 
obtained a Philippine driver's license.  The Court held that Stokes' 
lack of a Philippine driver's license was not fatal to the enforcement 
of the insurance policy; and that MALAYAN was estopped from denying 
liability under the insurance policy because it accepted premium payment
 made by the insured one day after the accident.  It said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Defendant cannot evade liability under the policy by virtue of 
the above provision of the Land Transportation and Traffic Code.  This 
is an insurance case.  The basis of insurance contracts is good faith 
and trust between the insurer and the insured.  The matter of the 
failure on the part of Stokes to have a Philippine driver's license is 
not such a defect that can be considered as fatal to the contract of 
insurance, because the fact is that Stokes still had a valid and 
unexpired Irish license.  As a matter of fact, the traffic officer who 
investigated the incident gave Stokes a traffic violation receipt and 
not a ticket for driving without license. </p>
  <p> "Then the Court believes that defendant is in estoppel in this 
case because it allowed the plaintiff to pay the insurance premium even 
after the accident occurred.  Admitting for the sake of argument that 
there was a violation of the terms of the policy before the incident, 
the admission or acceptance by the insurance company of the premium 
should be considered as a waiver on its part to contest the claim of the
 plaintiffs."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this appeal, the two issues resolved by the court a quo are raised anew.  We find the appeal meritorious.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.   A contract of insurance is a contract of indemnity upon the 
terms and conditions specified therein.  When the insurer is called upon
 to pay in case of loss or damage, he has the right to insist upon 
compliance with the terms of the contract.  If the insured cannot bring 
himself within the terms and conditions of the contract, he is not 
entitled as a rule to recover for the loss or damage suffered.  For the 
terms of the contract constitute the measure of the insurer's liability,
 and compliance therewith is a condition precedent to the right of 
recovery. (Young vs. Midland Textile Insurance Co., 30 Phil. 617.)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Under the "authorized driver" clause, an authorized driver must not only be <em>permitted </em>to
 drive by the insured.  It is also essential that he is permitted under 
the law and regulations to drive the motor vehicle and is <em>not disqualified</em> from so doing under any enactment or regulation.
</p><p>
At the time of the accident, Stokes had been in the Philippines for more
 than 90 days.  Hence, under the law, he could not drive a motor vehicle
 without a Philippine driver's license.  He was therefore not an 
"authorized driver" under the terms of the insurance policy in question,
 and MALAYAN was right in denying the claim of the insured.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    2.   Acceptance of premium within the stipulated period for payment 
thereof, including the agreed period of grace, merely assures continued 
effectivity of the insurance policy in accordance with its terms.  Such 
acceptance does not estop the insurer from interposing any valid defense
 under the terms of the insurance policy.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The principle of estoppel is an equitable principle rooted upon natural 
justice which prevents a person from going back on his own acts and 
representations to the prejudice of another whom he has led to rely upon
 them.  The principle does not apply to the instant case.  In accepting 
the premium payment of the insured, MALAYAN was not guilty of any 
inequitable act or representation.  There is nothing inconsistent 
between acceptance of premium due under an insurance policy and the 
enforcement of its terms.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is reversed.  The complaint is dismissed.  Costs against the appellees.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
