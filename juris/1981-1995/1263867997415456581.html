<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as gleaned from the record, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> owned five (5) parcels of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Hecming</span>, <span class="SpellE">Virac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
lots were designated as Lot No. 1661-A, Lot No. 1661-C, Lot No. 1661-D, Lot No.
1662, and Lot No. 1663.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

181,035 square meters.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The couple was childless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, when Francisco died on <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="2">February
 16, 1950</st1:date>, his entire estate, including his share of the five
aforementioned parcels of land, was inherited by his widow, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter however, had just one surviving relative
in the person of her nephew <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Abada</span>, whom she appointed as administrator of her property
in <span style="">1956.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span>
also had just one household helper named Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span>,
who had served her and her husband for many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dolores continued to stay with <span style="">h</span>er even after her husband's
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During her years of service with
the <span class="SpellE">Liankos</span>, Dolores bore two illegitimate children
by <span class="SpellE">Felicisima's</span> nephew, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>

<p class="BODY">The instant dispute took root when <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> purportedly donated one of her lots, namely
Lot No. 1661-D, to Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span> and her children,
as evidenced by a deed of donation dated <st1:date year="1950" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Dolores allegedly accepted the donation for herself and her
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of <span style="">the donation, the five lots of <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> were yet <span class="SpellE">unsurveyed</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only in 1959 when she caused the survey of her land, with the consent of both
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abada</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the evidence presented by private respondents before
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the 1959 survey delineated the property in the
following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot No. <span style="">1661-A, </span><span style="">Lot </span><span style="">No. 1661-C, Lot No.
1661-D and Lot No. 1662 went to <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Abada</span>, and Lot No. 1663 to Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Private respondents further contend that, as
a consequence of said survey, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> executed an affidavit dated </span><st1:date year="1963" day="6" month="2"><span style="">February
 6, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, wherein she
defined the boundaries of the lot she donated to Dolores, which is Lot No.
1663.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on the other hand, have a different version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that the aforementioned affidavit
is proof of a donation separate and distinct from the 1950 donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Petitioners
contend that the </span>lots <span style="">donated,
as well as the <span class="SpellE">donees</span>, are different in each
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the donation of 1950, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> donated Lot No.
1661-D to Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span> and her children, whereas in
the donation evidenced by the 1963 affidavit, it was Lot No. 1663 which <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> donated, and to
Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To bolster their claim, petitioners presented a certification by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span> that OCT No. 178
Vol. </span>III <span style="">covering Lot No. 1663 </span>was
issued to Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span> <span style="">on August 16, 1963, pursuant to Free Patent No. 203497 issued by the
Bureau of Lands on June 4, 1962.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In addition, petitioners presented evidence
showing that after the death of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span>, OCT
No. 178 was cancelled by virtue of an extrajudicial settlement of Lot No. 1663
in favor of the heirs of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span>
(petitioners), under TCT No. 103 issued on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="6" month="12"><span style="">December 6, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, petitioners purchased Lot No. 1661-D (the very same
piece of land covered by the deed of donation of 1950) from <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> for the sum of P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">transaction
was evidenced by a deed of sale dated </span><st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="11"><span style="">November 23, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The description of Lot No. 1661-D in the
deed of sale is exactly the same description of the property covered by the
deed of donation of 1950.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
testified before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that they purchased the lot in
question in order to "reinforce" their ownership thereof, as they
believed that the donation of said lot to them and their mother did not convey
full ownership to them.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Nevertheless, it was conceded by petitioners
that Lot No. 1661-D remained titled, and declared for taxation purposes in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But they claimed to have possession of the
land from 1950 to 1972, and that after the sale, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> tried to take possession and administration of
the lot, but was prevented from doing so by <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abada</span>, who eventually inherited the entire estate of <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> when she died
intestate on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="3"><span style="">March 31, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioners filed a complaint for possession and
quieting of title over Lot No. 1661-D against their father <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abada</span> before the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Catanduanes</span>, Branch 1, docketed as Civil Case No. 987.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Abada</span> died and was substituted as party defendant by
his wife Virginia and his thirteen legitimate children.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered a
decision in favor of petitioners, declaring them to be the lawful owners of the
lot in question, and ordered private respondents to <span style="">vacate the same and surrender possession thereof to petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, respondent court reversed <span style="">the </span>decision of the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The appellate court found that based
on the evidence presented before the lower court, the land under litigation,
Lot No. 1661-D, was not satisfactorily proven by <span style="">petitioners to be the same land subject matter </span>of <span style="">the deed of donation and the deed of sale
presented by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition for<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>review,
wherein petitioners raise three assignments of error, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>3. RESPONDENT COURT
OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OF JURISDICTION IN
REVERSING AND SETTING ASIDE THE APPEALED DECISION AND DECLARING
DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS THE OWNERS OF THE LAND IN QUESTION."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All these assigned errors may be put together into a single
issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not Lot No 1661-D was
duly proved by petitioners to be the same land subject of the deed of donation
and the deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the record reveals that Our answer must be in
the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is fundamental in the correct resolution of this case lies
in the interpretation of the sketch plans<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
depicting the property of <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> which were presented by the parties before the trial
court, as well as the deeds presented by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are the only substantial pieces of
evidence in the record which would enable the determination of the identity of
the land under <span style="">litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style=""> n</span>oted that as stated in the deed of <span style="">donation, the adjoining land south of the land described therein is
stated to be that of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The five lots were previously titled in the
name of <span class="SpellE">Felicisima's</span> late husband.) Consequently, the
lower court postulated that this southern boundary could at present be Lot No.
1662 and Lot No. 1663 in the sketch plans, as there is no land owned by
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span> south of Lot No. 1663.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it concluded that based on the
southern boundary, the property described in the deed of donation could only
refer to Lot No. 1661-D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was likewise observed by the trial court that Lot No. 1661-D
as stated in the sketch plans<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
contains an area of 171,051 square meters, or more than 17 hectares, which is
closer to the land area of the lot described in the deed of donation, unlike
Lot No. 1663 which has an area of only six (6<span style="">) </span>hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>held that Lot No. 1663
could not possibly be the land subject of the deed of donation and the <span style="">deed of sale, contrary to the contention of
private respondents, because if the original certificate of title covering Lot
No. 1663 was based on the deed of donation of 1950, then the same should have
been issued in the name not only of Dolores <span class="SpellE">Buitre</span>
but also of her children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is plain to the eye that the foregoing findings of the trial
court in support of its award of Lot No. 1661-D to <span style="">petitioners are at best weak and based largely on conjecture.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, based its reversal of the
lower court decision on the evidence presented and on established
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A summary of said
decision would be proper at this juncture in order to show that denial of the
instant petition is called for.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the appellate court, the sketch plans presented by
both parties show that Lot No. 1661-D is bounded on the north by the properties
of <span class="SpellE">Leonarda</span> Vargas, Albino <span style="">Taller, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Vargas and Juan <span class="SpellE">Sorra</span>; on the east by <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dionisia</span> de <span class="SpellE">Lumbao</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Papango</span> and <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Taller; on the south by a road; and on the west by
Lot No. 1661-A and Lot No. 1661-B.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the land in question is described in the deed of
donation and deed of sale as being bounded on the north by the properties of
Felix <span class="SpellE">Abundo</span>, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Zafe</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Zafe</span>; on the
east by Maria <span class="SpellE">Arcilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
Posada; on the south by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Lianko</span>; and on the
west by <span style="">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tablate</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Alipio</span> Benavides.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court observed that the boundaries as set out in
the sketch plans cannot be reconciled with the land descriptions as set forth
in the deeds of donation and sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
gross inconsistency can only lead to the inescapable conclusion that the land
described in the deeds of donation and sale do not pertain to Lot No. 1661-D,
as described in the sketch plans of both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And because petitioners failed to explain the
discrepancy or present other evidence to prove with certainty the location and
area of the land they seek to recover, respondent court correctly applied the
invariable rule that a person who claims ownership of real property is
duty-bound to clearly identify the land being claimed, in accordance with the
title on which he anchors his right of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the record does not show that the land
subject matter of the action for recovery of possession has been exactly
determined, such action cannot prosper,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
as in the case of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In sum,
proof of ownership coupled with identity of the land is the basic rule.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, the rule is likewise
well-settled that in order that an action for recovery of possession may
prosper, it is indispensable that he who brings the action fully proves not
only his ownership but also the identity of the property claimed, by describing
the location, area and boundaries thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>As the appellate court succinctly
stated, "he who claims to have a better right to the property must clearly
show that the land possessed by the other party is the very land that belongs
to him."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly noted that the boundaries as
set out in the sketch plans cannot be reconciled with the land descriptions as
set forth in the <span style="">deed of donation and
in the deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incompatibility
is much too glaring to be ignored, such that the property described in the
deeds of donation and sale and the land in question cannot possibly pertain to
one and the same parcel of land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, respondent court also found that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
erroneously identified the land in question as Lot No. 1661-D simply on </span><span style="">t</span><span style="">he
basis of the southernmost boundary of the land, and on its land area, which, as
stated in the aforementioned deeds, is more proximate to the land area of Lot
No. 1661-D than to that of Lot No. 1663 as stated in the sketch plans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We uphold the finding of the appellate court
that the exact location and identity of the land under litigation cannot be
determined on the mere basis of the southernmost boundary without giving the
least consideration to the other boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In like manner, the land in question cannot be determined as Lot No.
1661-D simply because the land area of the property donated as stated in the
deeds of donation and sale is "very close" to the land area of Lot
No. 1661-D as stated in the sketch plans.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">finding can never approximate the standard
set by the law t</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">at the land being claimed should be clearly
identified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we cite <span style="">with a</span>pproval
several material <span style="">inconsistencies
considered by the Court of Appeals to further militate against the cause of
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the latter admitted
that the land descriptions set forth in the deed of donation was based on old
boundaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that the
land was later surveyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet the
deed </span>of <span style="">sale contained the very
same land description as that found in the deed of donation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, only Lot No. 1663 was turned </span><span style="">over </span><span style="">to petitioners by virtue of an extrajudicial settlement,
notwithstanding that they were at the time in possession of the deed o</span>f <span style="">donation, thus giving them every reason to
include the lot purportedly covered by said donation in the extrajudicial settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>But <span style="">they did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lastly, it took
petitioners four years from the execution of the deed of sale in 1973 before
taking formal and positive action to claim Lot No. 1661-D.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners would not have committed, or
omitted, to do all the foregoing if they truly and honestly believe that Lot
No. 1661-D belongs to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, however, invoke the general rule that findings of
fact of the trial court which tried the case and heard the witnesses are not to
be disturbed on appeal, unless <span style="">substantial
</span>facts <span style="">and circumstances have
been overlooked which, if properly considered, might affect the outcome of </span><span style="">the</span><span style=""> case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> We have no objection to the rule
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, its application to the
instant case would be improper as the rule is usually more appropriate for
criminal cases wherein testimonies </span>of <span style="">witnesses are often the key to conviction or acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say, however, that it finds no
application in civil cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> rule cannot be
applied to the resolution of the case at bar as the latter falls squarely
within the exception to said rule, as above-stated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court clearly <span class="SpellE">misappreciated</span>
the evidence thereby warranting </span>a <span style="">reversal
by the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, We

<p class="BODY">Still grasping at straws, petitioners aver in the instant
petition that the disparity in the names of the owners of the lots adjoining
the land in question as described in the deeds <span style="">of donation and sale and the sketch plans is most likely due to the
probability that these names may have changed over time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a claim without the benefit of any hard
evidence to support it with is nothing but mere conjecture, much like the
decision of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span> <span style="">in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it
to say that to the very end, petitioners have miserably failed in proving their
ownership of Lot No. 1661-D.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
