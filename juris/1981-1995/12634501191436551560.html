<p class="BODY"><span style="">It appears from the

 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negotiations were held thereafter between the

nevertheless continued their negotiations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 </span><span style="">3, </span><span style="">1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, the private respondent and petitioner
concluded and signed a collective bargaining agreement which, among other
things, provided for a 3-stage wage increase for all rank and file
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms of the agreement on
wage increase, which were retroactive to </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, follow:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Meanwhile, on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="4"><span style="">April
 21, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, P.D. 1123
was enacted to take effect on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5"><span style="">May 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> providing for an increase by P60.00 in the
living allowance ordained by P.D. 525.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This increase was implemented effective </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5"><span style="">May 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> by the respondent company, as shown by
Memorandum No. 6-77 of the respondent company's General Manager to all employees
dated </span><st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="4"><span style="">April 23, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">
(p. 12, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The controversy arose
when the petitioner union sought the implementation of the negotiated wage
increase of P0.80 as provided for in the collective bargaining agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent company alleges that it has opted
to consider the P0.80 daily wage increase (roughly P22 per month) as partial
compliance with the requirements of said decree, so that it is obliged to pay
only the balance of P38 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect, the payment of the additional P60 covers both the requirements of the
decree and the negotiated wage increase of P0.80 daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company asserts that since there
was already a meeting of the minds between the parties as early as </span><st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="4"><span style="">April 2,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> about the wage
increases which were made retroactive to </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, it fell well within the exemption provided
for in the Rules Implementing P.D. 112, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Coverage.</span> - These
rules shall apply to all employers except the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.25in; text-indent: -0.35in;">"(<span class="GramE">k</span>)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those that have
granted in addition to the allowance under P.D. 525, at least P60.00 monthly
wage increase on or after <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1977</st1:date>, provided that those who paid less than this amount shall pay
the difference."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand,
petitioner maintains that the living allowance under P.D. 1123 (originally P.D.
525) is distinct and separate from the negotiated wage increase of P0.80 daily
[pp. 6 &amp; 96, rec.].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it
adds, when the CBA was signed by the parties on September 3, 1977, the
respondent company was fully aware of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of P.D. 1123 and had already been paying the increased allowance provided
therein [</span><span style="">p. </span><span style="">94, rec.].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the respondent company acted in bad faith when it refused to pay
the negotiated wage increase in violation of the collective bargaining
agreement and the respondent company is guilty of unfair labor practice,
pursuant to the following provisions of the Labor Code:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Article 248.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Unfair Labor Practices of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="2"><span style="">February
 13, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
petitioner filed a complaint dated </span><st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="2"><span style="">February 10, 1978</span></st1:date><span style=""> for unfair labor practice and violation of
the CBA against the respond­ent company [pp. 13-16, rec.].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, an Order [p. 18, rec.] was issued by Labor
Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, and by authority of Article
263 of the Labor Code as amended, let this case be, as it is hereby, DISMISSED
and the same is referred to the parties or disputants for them to resolve their
<span style="">disputes, grievances or matters arising
</span>from the implementation, application or interpretation of their Collective
Bargaining Agreement in accordance with the Machinery established in the
CBA."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From this order, both
parties appealed to the respondent Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed its appeal on June 28, 1978 [pp. 31-34, rec.]
assailing the order of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Maglaya</span> as
contrary to law and the evidence adduced during the hearing, which constitutes
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It avers that the matter had already been
taken up on grievance but the respondent company refused to implement the P0.80
wage increase under the <span style="">CBA, </span>and
that it further refuses to submit to voluntary arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it prays for the setting aside of the
Labor Arbiter's Order and for the parties to submit to voluntary arbitration as
provided for in their CBA and the provisions of the Labor <span style="">Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent company filed on July 5, 1978 a
partial appeal [pp. 19-27, rec.], accepting the dismissal of the complaint but
assail­ing that portion of the Labor Arbiter's Order declaring the subject
matter as <span class="SpellE">grievable</span> and therefore <span class="SpellE">threshable</span>
under the parties' CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its prayer was
for <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the dismissal, reversal of the
referral to the parties for threshing out under their CBA, and for a
declaration that it has not committed an unfair labor practice nor violated the
CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1978</st1:date>,
the respondent Commission (Second Division) promulgated its decision, setting
aside the order appealed from and entering a new one dismissing the case for
obvious lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal is
predicated on the opinion [<span style="">p. </span>45,
rec.] of the Undersecretary of Labor when he said:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If as you said, management and labor had agreed on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1977</st1:date> to grant an amount of
P22.00 (roughly) per month to its employees retroactive to <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1977</st1:date>, then the exemption is squarely in
point, notwithstanding that the CBA was signed in May or June.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be so for reason that on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1977</st1:date>, there was already the
meeting of the minds of the parties and for legal <span class="GramE">purposes,
the contract was</span> already perfected as of said date."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said the respondent Commission:</p>

<blockquote>"We fully subscribe to this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It needs no further elaboration to
demonstrate that by the facts and the terms of the law, the respondent has to
pay each of the employees concerned a total of P60.00 monthly for it to satisfy
payment of both the wage increase and the allowance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In resume, we find the refusal of the respondent to submit to
voluntary arbitration to be validly grounded and, therefore, not constitutive
of unfair labor practice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We further
find to be untenable the complainant's claim for full payment of both the P0.80
daily wage increase under the CBA and the P60 allowance under P.D. 1123"
[pp. 45-46, rec.].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner then filed its
motion for reconsideration but the NLRC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dismissed the
same in its resolution of February 8, 1979 [pp. 48-54, </span><span style="">rec.], </span><span style="">pursuant to Section 7, Rule </span><span style="">II </span><span style="">of the Rules and </span><span style="">Regulations </span>Implementing <span style="">P.D. No. 1391, which became effective on
September 15, 1978 and provides thus --<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 7.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Decisions of the Commissions</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There shall henceforth be no appeal from such
decisions to the Minister of Labor except as provided in P.D. 1367 and its
implementing rules concerning appeals to the Prime Minister, and the decisions
of the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> or any of its Decisions shall be final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
the instant petition.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that private respondent violated the CBA and
committed an ULP when it refused to pay the negotiated wage increase of P0.80
daily effective <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1977</st1:date>,
to the employees within the bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents, however, contend that there was no violation of the
CBA and that its application of the negotiated wage increase as partial
compliance with P.D. 1123 is well within the provisions of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the CBA shows that it was made and entered into on
the 3rd day of September, 1977 by and between the parties herein (p1. see p. 1
of Annex "B" at p. 7 of NLRC rec.) although the first year of its
increase was retroactive to <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April 1,
 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time it was
perfected and signed by the parties, P.D. 1123 was already in force and
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A sample pay advice [p. 11 -
insert, rec.] and the Memorandum No. 6-77 dated <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1977</st1:date> [p. 12, rec.] signed by the General Manager
of respondent company show that the said P.D. was implemented by respondent
company on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is nothing in the records to indicate
that the negotiated wage increases were granted or paid before May, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it cannot be said that the respondent
Company falls within the exceptions provided for in paragraph (k) of the rules
implementing P.D. 1123.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time <span style="">the said P.D. took effect, there was neither
a perfected contract nor an actual payment of the said increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was therefore no grant of said
increases as yet, despite the contrary opinion expressed in the letter of
Undersecretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The said letter dated <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1977</st1:date> [p. 33, NLRC rec.] of Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
is based on a wrong premise and misrepresentation on the part of respondent
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was alleged in the letter of
respondent company that the wage increases were "<u>agreed upon by the
company and the bargaining union on April 2, 1977</u> in recognition of the
imperative need for employees to cope up with inflation brought about by, among
others, another increase in oil price" [p. 31, NLRC rec.].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not, however stated that<span style=""> at the time the said letter was written,
negotiations were still being held "on other unresolved economic and
non-economic bargaining items and it was only on September 3, 1977 when they
reached agreement thereon" [p1. see p. 7 of private respondent's
Memorandum, p. 107, rec.].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There was therefore no binding contract between the parties
before <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For "if any essential item is left open
for future consideration, there is no binding contract, and an agreement to
reach an agreement imposes no obligation on the parties thereto" [17 Am. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jur</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> 2d
362].</p>

<p class="BODY">Such being the case, and without actual payment of the agreed
P0.80 wage increase, there could have been no "grant" of wage increases
within the contemplation of paragraph K, Section 1 of the Rules implementing
P.D. 1123 to place the respondent company within the purview of the exemption
provided for in the said rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, its refusal to implement the P0.80 wage increase for
the first year of the CBA constitutes a violation thereof and makes the
respondent company guilty of unfair labor practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent company is also guilty of bad faith when it signed
the CBA on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date>
without in any way letting the petitioner union know that it was going to apply
part of the allowances being paid under P.D. 1123 to the wage increases
provided for <span style="">in </span>the CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the time of the implementation of
P.D. 1123 on <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1977</st1:date> and
the signing of the CBA on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3,
 1977</st1:date>, nothing was said between the parties about the wage increase
despite the fact that negotiations were still going on between the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exchange of letters <span style="">between the respondent company and Labor
Undersecretary</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> appears to have been concealed from the union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">According to the respondent
Commission, "the wage increase (however) was not immediately implemented
because Mr. Alfred <span class="SpellE">Flug</span> who was to bring home funds
was still in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">United

increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point the CBA was
already per­fected and signed by the parties, so that its terms and stipulations
have the force of law between them.</p>

intention of the parties (17 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. <span class="GramE">2d.,</span> 631).</p>

<p class="BODY">What was the intention of the parties relative to the wage
increases?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory reading of the CBA
indicates that the benefits provided therein are not exclusive of other
benefits, as may be gleaned from the provisions of its Section 4, Article XIV
[p. 42 of the CBA at p. 6, NLRC rec.], which speaks of "any other benefits
or privileges which are not expressly provided in this Agreement, even if now
accorded or hereafter accorded to the employees and workers, shall be deemed
purely acts of grace x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, in the accompanying Memorandum of Understanding [pp.
82-83, NLRC rec.] dated <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September <span style="">3, </span>1977</st1:date>, the parties have
agreed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as it does not contravene the law and
its implementing rules and regulations the COMPANY agrees to effect a uniform
and indiscriminate wage increase in the salaries of its employees within the
bargaining unit represented by the UNION regardless of their position and pay
rates, in the event that the government shall direct another increase(s) <span style="">in the statutory minimum wage fixed under
P.D. 928 within the period of three years from the signing of this
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The uniform increase
contemplated in this instrument will be equivalent to the amount of the statutory
wage increase or adjustment."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The bases of the dissent
of Madame Justice Herrera are that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><b><span style="">I.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
P0.80 per day increase was already granted as early as <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1977</st1:date> when the company agreed to give wage
increases to its employees effective <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, such grant
should be credited against the emergency cost of living allowance (ECOLA)
provided for by P.D. 1123.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">II.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Department's (Labor) view on the matter of exemptions from
P.D. 1123 should be given weight since it was not interpreting or construing a
statute but explaining the extent of its own rule.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">III.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is inequitable that an employer who has granted increases in pay
to his employees on a given day is further ordered to give additional increases
one, two or three days thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">IV.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Social justice requires that the broader requirements of a stable

fulfilled; to accord; to bestow or confer; and is synonymous with 'concede'
which means to agree on the idea of bestowal or acknowledgment especially of a
right or privilege" (Woods vs. Reilly, 211 S.W. 2d 591, 597).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, the "grant"
could be said to have been made at the time of the agreement, although there

from the self-serving statements of the company in its various communications

possible that the company's decision to give the P0.80 daily increase effective
April 1, 1977 was influenced by the knowledge that it could be absorbed by the
additional ECOLA provided for by P.D. 1123, and that such decision was
definitely made after receipt of the letter dated July 15, 1977 of then
Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> (p. 130, rec.)?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also conceded that the Department of Labor had the right to

misapprehension of facts, but also unlaw­ful because it goes beyond the scope

<p class="BODY">The CBA entered into between the parties on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date> created certain obligations

<p class="BODY">A cursory reading of the CBA dated <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date> reveals the following intentions of the
parties:</p>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the wage increases <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
should be staggered for a 3-year period retroactive to <span style="">April 1, 1977 (see page 2 of Private Respondent's Memorandum, p. 102,
rec.); and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That such wage increases are exclusive of
any statutory increase in the minimum wage, obliging the company to effect a
uniform and indiscriminate wage increase equivalent to the increase or
adjustment in the minimum wage that may be decreed within a period of three years
from the signing of the instrument on September 3, 1977 <span style="">(see </span>par. 1 <span style="">of the Memorandum of Understanding, p. 83, NLRC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The staggered wage
increase will not be achieved if the same were to be absorbed by the
P60-increase in the </span>ECOLA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">For a computation of the NWI under the CBA
will approximately amount to the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">First year -------- P0.80 daily or
approximately P22/mo.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Second year ---<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>.50 daily or approximately<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>13.75/mo.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Third year -------<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>.50 daily or approximately<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>13.75/</u>mo.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Monthly <u>total</u> for 3 years . . . . .
. . . .<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P49.50</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, it will be seen
that because the resultant total in the monthly-wage increase over the 3-year
period under the CBA is less than P60.00, the same will always be covered by
the </span>ECOLA, <span style="">and there will be no
occasion for a staggered increase during the period other than what the law may
provide -- which is not the intention of the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is submitted that had
the parties intended that to be the end, they should have incorporated the same
in their CBA or in their Memorandum of Understanding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also apparent that
the </span><span style="">crediting </span><span style="">of the NWI in the </span>ECOLA <span style="">was an afterthought on the part of the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not, then the company was in
bad faith when it did not mention its plan to credit the </span><span style="">NWI </span><span style="">to the </span>ECOLA <span style="">during the
negotiations prior to the signing of the CBA on September 3, 1977, as soon as
it received the opinion of then Under-Secretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
in his letter of July 13, 1977 (p. 130, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>IV</u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is submitted that the
principle of social justice will be better served by upholding the protection
to labor policy guaranteed by the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Honorable Chief
Justice Enrique M. Fernando, in explaining the concept of social justice,
wrote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"What is thus stressed is that a fundamental principle as
social justice, identified as it is with the broad scope of the police power,
has an even more basic role to play in aiding those whose lives are spent in
toil, with destitution an ever-present threat, to attain a certain degree of
economic well-being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, through
the social justice coupled with the protection to labor provisions, the
government is enabled to pursue an active and militant policy to give reality
and substance to the proclaimed aspiration of a better life and more decent
living conditions for all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in that
spirit that in 1969, in Del Rosario vs. Delos Santos (L-20586, March 21, 1969,
22 SCRA 1196), reference was made to what the social justice concept signifies
in the realistic language of the late President <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'He who has less in life should have more in
law.' After tracing the course of decisions which spoke uniformly to the effect
that the tenancy legislation, now on the statute books, is not vitiated by
constitutional infirmity, the Del Rosario opinion made clear why it is easily
understandable 'from the enactment of the Constitution with its avowed concern
for those who have less in life, [that] the constitutionality of such
legislation has been repeatedly upheld.' What is sought to be accomplished by the
above fundamental principle is to assure the effectiveness of the community's
effort to assist the economically underprivileged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For under existing conditions, without succor
and support, they might not, unaided, be able to secure justice for themselves"
(Fernando, Enrique M., Constitution of the Philippines, pp. 80-81 [1974]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More than elusive justice, survival is the daily problem of the
worker and his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The employer is
not faced with such a problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
often than not, <span style="">the employer dissipates part of his income or profit in pleasures of the
flesh and gambling aside from luxuries, fabulous parties and conspicuous
consumption.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
stability of the economy does not depend on the employer alone, but on
government economic policies concerning productivity in all areas and not only
in the clothing or textile industries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is not even an intimation that the company is losing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the living wage of the workers which is
the basis of a stable economy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
company cannot pay a living wage, it has no business operating at the expense
of the lives of its workers from the very start.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
preservation of the lives of the citizens is a basic duty of the State, more
vital than the preservation of the profits of the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the State is engaged in a life-and-death
struggle, like war or rebellion, it is the citizen worker who fights in defense
of the State and for the preservation of the existence of corporations and
businesses within its territorial confines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the life of the State is threatened from within and without, it is
the citizen, not the corporation or business enterprise, that mans the weapons
of war and <span class="GramE">march</span> into battle.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To
invoke the nebulous term "stable economy" to justify rejection of the
claims of the workers as against the assets of the <span class="GramE">employer,</span>
is to regard human life as more expendable than corporate capital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the Constitution that
expressly guarantees the viability of business enterprises much less assuring
them of profits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><u>V<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover,
it must be pointed out that the Secretary of Labor has exceeded his authority
when he included paragraph (k) in Section 1 of the Rules Implementing P.D.
1123.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section
1 of said decree spells out the scope of its benefits, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the Private Sector.</span>
- In the private sector, an across-the-board increase of sixty pesos (P60.00)
in emergency allowance as provided in P.D. 525 shall be paid by <u>all</u>
employers to their employees effective <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">1
 May 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
monthly emergency allowance under P.D. 525 is hereby amended as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“a) <span class="GramE">For</span> workers being paid P50.00 --
P110</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b) For workers being paid P30.00 --<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>90</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“c) For workers being paid P15.00 --<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>75."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To implement the same, the then Secretary of Labor was authorized
in Section 4 of the same decree to issue appropriate rules and
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such authority is quoted
hereunder:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Labor and the Commissioner
of the Budget shall issue appropriate rules and regulations to implement this
Decree for their respective sectors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Under such rules and regulations, distressed employers whether
public or private may be exempted while in such condition in the interest of
development and employment."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of such rule-making authority, the Secretary of Labor
issued on May 1, 1977 a set of rules which exempts not only distressed
employers (see paragraph 1, Section 1 as well as Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9 of said
rules) but also "those who have granted in addition to the allowance under
P.D. 525, at least P60.00 monthly wage increase on or after January 1, 1977,
provided that those who paid less than this amount shall pay the difference
(see paragraph <u>k</u> of said rules).</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the inclusion of paragraph <u>k</u> contravenes the
statutory authority granted to the Secretary of Labor, and the same is
therefore void, as ruled by this Court in a long line of cases, among which
are:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. <span class="SpellE">Teozon</span> vs. Members of the Board of
Administrators, PVA (33 SCRA 585, 588-589):</p>

<blockquote>"The recognition of the power of administrative officials to
promulgate rules in the administration of the statute, necessarily limited to
what is provided for in the legislative enactment, may be found in the early
case of United States vs. Barrios decided in 1908.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came in a 1914 decision, <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span>
Molina (29 Phil. 119) delineation of the scope of such competence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'Of course the regulations adopted under legislative authority by a
particular department must be in harmony with the provisions of the law, and
for the sole purpose of carrying into effect its general provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By such regulations, of course, the law
itself cannot be extended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long,
however, as the regulations relate solely to carrying into effect the provisions
of the law, they are valid.' In 1936, in People vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
this Court expressed its disapproval of an administrative order that would
amount to an excess of the regulatory power vested in an administrative
official.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reaffirmed such a doctrine
in a 1951 decision, where we again made clear that where an administrative order
betrays inconsistency or repugnancy to the provisions of the Act, 'the mandate
of the Act must prevail and must be followed.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice Barrera, speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Victorias</span>
Milling Inc. vs. Social Security Commission, citing Parker as well <span style="">as </span>Davis
did tersely sum up the matter thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A
rule <span style="">is </span>binding
on the Courts so long as the procedure fixed for its promulgation is followed
and its scope is within the statutory authority granted by the legislature,
even if the courts are not in agreement with the policy stated therein or its
innate wisdom x xx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">On the other hand, administrative
interpretation </span>of the law is </u><u><span style="">at best merely advisory, for it is the courts that finally determine
what the law </span>means</u>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It cannot be otherwise as the Constitution limits the
authority of the President, in whom all executive power resides, to take care <span style="">that the laws be faithfully executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No lesser administrative executive office or
agency then can, contrary to the express language of the Constitution, assert
for itself a more extensive prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, it is bound to observe the constitutional mandate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be strict compliance with the
legislative enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its terms must be
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statute requires adherence
to, not departure from its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No deviation is allowable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
terse language of the present Chief Justice, an administrative agency 'cannot
amend an act of Congress.' Respondents can be sustained, therefore, only if it
could be shown that the rules and regulations promulgated by them were in
accordance with what the Veterans Bill of Rights provides" (underlining

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The meaning of the rule
is that when an employer had "<u>granted</u>" increases to his
employees after </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="1"><span style="">January 1, <span class="GramE">1977</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">,</span></span><span style=""> such increases shall be credited against the
P60.00 ECOLA provided in PD 1123.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the Secretary of Labor could exempt distressed
employers from complying with </span>PD <span style="">1123,
it is believed that the regulation to debit the P60.00 ECOLA with wage
increases granted to employees after </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="1"><span style="">January 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> was within the authority of the Secretary to
make.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Giving credit to
employers for increases granted to employees within a short period before an
ECOLA becomes effective is a sound rule.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is inequitable that an employer, who has granted increases in pay to
his employees on a given day, is further ordered to give additional increases
one, two or three days thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
arrangement or <span class="GramE">policy,</span> was followed by the Secretary
in regards to PD 1614 which became effective on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Increases granted to employees after </span><st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="12"><span style="">December 1, 1978</span></st1:date><span style=""> could be credited against the ECOLA provided
in that Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policy was expressly
followed in PD 1634 which itself provided that the P60.00 ECOLA, effective
September 1, 1979, could be lessened by the increases granted to employees on
or after August 1, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In PD 1678, the
ECOLA which became effective </span><st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="2"><span style="">February 20, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> was credited with increases in wages granted
on or after </span><st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="2"><span style="">February 8, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In

gave its employees the P60.00 ECOLA provided in PD 1123.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 13, 1977, the COMPANY wrote to the
Department of Labor asking if </span>the wage increase <span style="">of P0.80 a day agreed upon on April 2, 1977 between the COMPANY and the
UNION, retroactively to April 1, 1977, could be credited against the ECOLA
provided in PD 1123 (p. 31, NLRC Record).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reply of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> was in the affirmative, the Department
stating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

April 1 increase of P0.80 a day to the May 1 ECOLA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The matter was taken up in grievance procedure,
but on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="1"><span style="">January 21, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the COMPANY took the definite stand in favor of the creditability (p.
2, NLRC Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, the </span><st1:place><span style="">UNION</span></st1:place><span style=""> filed a complaint with the Department of
Labor against the COMPANY for unfair labor practice in regards to the
creditability question, and asked that a voluntary arbitrator be agreed
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">UNION</span></span></st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">'s</span></span><span style=""> complaint, and said that the issue should be
resolved through further proceedings under the grievance machinery established
in the CBA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the Labor
Arbiter was appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which,
on September 1, 1978, set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed
the complaint of the UNION finding "to be untenable the complainant's
claim for full payment of both the P0.80 daily wage increase under the CBA and
the P60.00 allowance under PD 1123" (p. 46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is this Order of the NLRC which has been

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be relevant to

op. cit., 195-197).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
administrative interpretation of the law is at best merely advisory, for it is
the courts that finally determine what the law <span class="GramE">means</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 1(k) of the Rules
and Regulations for the implementation of PD 1123 is part of the
"law" </span><span style="">binding on
Courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the P0.80 per day increase
had actually been paid to the employees on April 1st, the conclusion should be
unquestionable that such increase was deductible from the May 1st ECOLA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The problem in this case has arisen because
that P0.80 increase, </span><span style="">de</span><span style="">finitely promised on April 2nd to be given as
of April 1st, was not given until it was absorbed by the ECOLA which began to
be payable on May 1st.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
Department's reply to the COMPANY of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, the matter of the P0.80 per day increase became
dormant until it was resuscitated with the execution of the CBA on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9"><span style="">September
 3, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It will be seen that in
the Department's letter to the COMPANY of July 15, 1977, it had construed the
word "granted" in section 1 (k) as not necessari­ly requiring</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">an
accomplished fact. "The word </span><u>grant</u> <span style="">is used therein in its broader meaning so as to be all embracing, </span>and
<span style="">includes both the creation of the
obligation and the actual extension, enjoyment of the wage increase." A
definite agreement to increase within the time frame should already be deemed
as a "granted" increase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Oxford English Dictionary </span><span style="">(Vol. </span><span style="">IV) defines "grant" and
"granted" as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Grant"-(grant), sb.<span style="">1</span>
Forms: see the vb. (f. the vb.) The action <span style="">of granting; the thing granted.<span style="">&nbsp;

senses of <span style="">the vb. 1.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Bestowed</u>,
<u>allotted</u>." <span style="">(p. </span><span style="">356).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Underscoring supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Woods v. Reilly, Tex. <span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. App., <span class="GramE">211</span> S.W. 2d 591, 597,
it was said, in reference to "grant" and "granted", that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Grant" means to agree or assent to; to allow <span style="">to </span>be fulfilled; <span style="">to </span>accord; to bestow or confer; and is
synonymous with<span style=""> 'concede' which means
to agree in the idea of bestowal </span>or <span style="">acknowl</span><span style="">edgment,
especially of </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">right or </span><span style="">privilege."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Granted" within provision of Teacher's Retirement Act de<span style="">fining 'retirement' as withdrawal from active
service with a </span>retirement <span style="">allowance
'granted' under </span>provisions of the Act, was not intended to mean
'immediately payable'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One thing is for sure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Department had the right to construe the word "granted", as used in
Section 1(k).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The construction it had
adopted cannot be viewed as so wrong as to allow us to reverse <span style="">it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
rule followed in this jurisdiction since Madrigal vs. Rafferty (38 Phil. 414 [1918])
is that great weight shall be given to the <span style="">interpretation or construction given </span>to <span style="">a statute </span>by the Government agency called upon to implement the
statute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, the weight in
favor of the Department of Labor should be greater, because the Department is
not interpreting or construing a statute, but it had explained the extent of
its own rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it is rather evident that the Department's
construction of the word "granted" as used in Section 1(k), as well as
the NLRC Order dis­missing the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">UNION</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> complaint, is reasonable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As previously explained, the objective of
Section 1(k) is to give equitable treatment to employers who have granted
"voluntary" increases to their employees on a given date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should not be subjected to further
"compulsory" increases one, two or three days thereafter. <span style="">"Voluntary" increases which the </span>employers
had granted within a reasonable period previous to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the "compulsory" increases should be credited against such
"compulsory" increases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
can be no <u>substantial</u> difference between "voluntary" increases
actually paid, and "voluntary" increases definitely agreed to be paid
and which would have been actually paid were it not for its absorption by the
"compulsory" increases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rationale of Section 1(k) is applicable to both situations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, it is well to remember that economic matters, such as
wages, are imbued with public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The broader requirements for the maintenance of a stable economy should
also be taken into account in resolving conflicts between labor and management.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be pertinent to
recall herein Justice Laurel's classic definition of social justice, a
fundamental principle enshrined in both the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> Social justice means the promotion of the
welfare of <i style=""><span style="">all </span></i><i><span style="">the people</span></i><span style="">, </span>the
adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability <span style="">of </span><i><span style="">all the competent elements of society</span></i><span style="">, </span>through the maintenance of a <i><span style="">proper economic and social equilibrium</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">in the interrelations of the members of the
community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally
justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise </span>of powers
underlying the existence <span style="">of all
governments on the time-honored principle of </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">salus</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">populi</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">suprema</span> <span class="SpellE">lex</span></span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of
the necessity of interdependence <i>among divers and diverse units </i><i><span style="">of </span>a society</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">of the protection that
should </span><i>be equally and evenly extended to </i><i style=""><span style="">all </span><span style="">groups as a combined force in our social and
economic </span></i><i><span style="">life</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">consistent with the fundamental and paramount
objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, </span>and quiet of <i style=""><span style="">all</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">persons</span></i><span style="">, </span>and of
bringing about 'the greatest good <span style="">to
the greatest number'." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Calalang</span>
vs. Williams, 70 Phil. pp. 726, 734-735 (1940) (Emphasis supplied).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is in view of the
foregoing considerations that I vote for the dismissal of the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the Court's judgment holding that contrary to
respondents' stand, the P60. - ECOLA (emergency cost of living allowance)
increase provided in P.D. 1123 issued on April 21, 1977 to take effect May 1,
1977 is not creditable to nor deductible from the negotiated wage increases
(NWI) negotiated and agreed by the parties in their collective bargaining
agreement (CBA) executed on September 3, 1977 (providing for staggered wage
increases for the workers for the three year period of the CBA in the
"munificent" total of P49. 50 per month, much less than the P60.
-ECOLA increase effective immediately, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>80 centavos daily or approximately P22.00
increase per month for the 1st year, 50 centavos daily or around P13.75/month
increase for the 2nd year and 50 centavos daily or around P13.75/month increase
for the 3rd year.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Even conceding that the parties had arrived at a partial
agreement on April 2, 1977 that the employees would be given the 80-centavo
daily wage increase retroactive to April 1st, 1977, still the memorandum of
understanding dated September 3, 1977 as signed by the parties (pp. 82-83, NLRC
record) clearly shows the intent of the parties that such negotiated staggered
wage increases were <u>exclusive</u> of any statutory increase in the minimum
wage and that the respondent employer obliged itself to effect a uniform and
indiscriminate wage increase equivalent to the increase or adjustment in the
minimum wage that may be decreed within a period of three years from the
signing of the CBA on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The ECOLA is after all, in effect, another increase means of <span class="GramE">effecting</span>
an increase in the minimum wage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conduct of the parties before and after the signing on
September 3, 1977 of the CBA bear out the parties' clear understanding and
agreement that the P60. -ECOLA increase effective <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1977</st1:date> was not to be taken into account or to be
deducted from the negotiated wage increases amounting to a total of P49.50 for
the third year of the CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reason and
experience rebel against the contrary assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If after all, the
negotiated wage increases in such a "munificent'' total of P49.</span> 50
for the third year of the CBA (and for a total of only P35.75/month for the 2nd
year of the CBA) were to be charged against the P60. -ECOLA increase, the long
negotiations for the staggered wage increases for the three-year duration of
the CBA would be of no use or meaning, for the workers were already receiving
the total P60. -increase from <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5">May 1,
 1977</st1:date>, without need of the CBA.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CBA then would work against instead of enhancing the very
interests of the workers, as witness the posture taken by respondent?<span style="">employer some months after its execution that
implementation of the CBA wage increases meant that the agreed P22./month wage
increase won by the workers in the CBA was to be set off against the ECOLA so
that it had to pay only a balance of P38./month for the ECOLA on the basis of
the opinion it had <u>unilaterally</u> secured from the Undersecretary of Labor
on July 15, 1977 that such wage increase had been "granted" by it on
April 1, 1977 and could be deducted from the ECOLA as against the undisputed
fact that it has not up to now paid a centavo of the agreed wage increase, even
of P22./month for the 1st year of the CBA from September 3, 1977 it had
supposedly granted since April 1, 1977 nor a centavo of the stipulated
staggered increases for the last 2 years of the CBA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the 3-year period of the CBA expired
last Septem­ber 3, 1980 without the workers having received the negotiated wage
increases stipulated in the CBA due to respondent employer's success so far in
tying up the payment thereof by reason of the erroneous opinion of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="7"><span style="">July 15,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style=""> it had
unilaterally secured from the Undersecretary of Labor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
beginning </span><st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="5"><span style="">May 1, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent-employer commenced paying the
workers the P60. -ECOLA increase <u>without any qualification or condition</u> that
would tie it up or make deductible <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the wage
increases that it was then negotiating with </span>the workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after it had <u>unilaterally</u>
obtained on <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1977</st1:date>
Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong's</span> favorable (to it) opinion,
it never divulged nor apprised the workers thereof during the negotiations that
they were still conducting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, even if
we were to be kind and not im­pute bad faith to the company and say that its
non-disclosure of Undersecretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong's</span> opinion
resulted in some ambiguity concerning the negotiated wage increases, this was
attributable to <span class="GramE">itself</span> alone and therefore must be
resolved against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is basis for the majority judgment's holding that the
implementing rule of the then Secretary of Labor in crediting the NWI against
the ECOLA is void for being in excess and contravention of the statutory
authority which exempted only distressed employers from the ECOLA, but I do not
deem it necessary to concur in such ruling due to my conclusions above stated
that the parties clearly understood and intended that the P60. -ECOLA increase
which respondent-employer had been paying to the workers since May 1, 1977
would not be charged against the staggered NWI in the September 3, 1977 CBA
which amounted to a "munificent" total of P49.50 for the three years
of the CBA which expired last September 3, 1980 and which the workers have yet
to be paid, due to the one-sided and oppressive stand adopted by
respondent-employer.</p>

The pertinent provision of the Memorandum of Understanding, as reproduced in
the judgment (at page 8) reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As long as it does not contravene the law and
its implementing rules and regulations the COMPANY agrees to effect a uniform
and indiscriminate wage increase in the salaries of its employees within the
bargaining unit represented by the UNION <span style="">regardless
of their position and pay rates, </span>in the event that the government shall
direct another increase(s) in the statutory minimum wage fixed under P.D. 928
within the period of three years from the signing of this instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The uniform increase contemplated in this
instrument will be equivalent to the amount of the <span style="">statutory wage increase or adjustment.</span></p>
