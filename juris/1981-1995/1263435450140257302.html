<blockquote>and to pay the costs in both cases."
(Decision, pp. 7-8; Rollo, pp. 21-22)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We accept as correct the operative facts as found by the trial
court and as stated by the appellee in his brief.  These facts are:</p>

<blockquote>"A barrio dance was held in the evening of February 17, 1990
at Barangay Cabaluay, Zamboanga City.  Among those present were private complainant Artemio Fernando and his
cousin Armando Marcos.  The appellants
Lucilo Bernardo and Antonio Fabor were also present in the said dance.  Around midnight, Artemio Fernando and
Armando Marcos left the dance and proceeded to go home.  After walking for about 100 meters from the
dance place, they were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">taken </span>aback
as they were waylaid by Lucilo Bernardo and Artemio Fabor whom Fernando easily
recognized.  Bernardo and Fabor, for no
reason at all, hurled sharp stones at them and Fernando was instantly hit at
his lower back portion.  Noticing that
Fabor was armed with a bladed weapon, Fernando ran but Fabor chased him and
stabbed him hitting the lower left portion of his nape.  When he turned, he saw his cousin Armando
Marcos being held by Bernardo pleading for his life.  He ran as fast as he could until he reached a billiard hall where
he sought help.  Afterwhich he proceeded
to a doctor for treatment.  (TSN, May
16, 1990, pp. 7-16)</blockquote>

<blockquote>PFC Quiterio Cuatrocruz, an investigator stationed in Manicahan
Police Sub-Station was also presented by the prosecution.  He testified that immediately after
receiving reports regarding the stabbing incident he proceeded to the scene of
the crime.  They found thereat the body
of Armando Marcos with stab wounds on different parts of his body.  He then had the body taken for a post-mortem
examination.  Thereafter, he proceeded
to the place of Lucilo Bernardo having been earlier tipped that Bernardo was
responsible for the crime.  Cuatrocruz
was able to talk to the mother of the accused but she refused to surrender her
son to him.  Cuatrocruz therefore sought
the assistance of the Barangay Captain of that place (TSN, May 17, 1990, pp.
3-7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Barangay Captain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Hipolito </span>Solis
for his part testified that he was able to convince Bernardo's mother to
surrender his son to him.  When he spoke
to Bernardo, the latter admitted having stabbed Marcos with a knife.  He voluntarily turned over the knife to
Solis.  Having named Antonio Fabor as
his companion, Bernardo accompanied Solis to the house of Fabor.  Solis spoke to Fabor who at first denied
participation in the crime but when he saw Bernardo, he finally admitted to
Solis that he was indeed with Bernardo during the incident.  Solis then asked Fabor to dress up and if
possible for him to use the same t-shirt he had on during the incident.  When Fabor returned, he informed the
Barangay Captain that he could not wear the same shirt as it was soaked with
blood.  They then proceeded to the
Manicahan Police Sub-Station.  (TSN, May
17, 1990, pp. 30-38)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lastly, the prosecution presented Assistant City Health Officer
Efren Apolinario who conducted the post-martem examination on the body of
Armando Marcos.  He testified that
Marcos’ death was caused by internal hemorrhage secondary to multiple stab
wounds.  He further stated that the
deceased sustained twelve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">stab </span>wounds."
(Appellee's Brief, pp. 5-8; Rollo, pp. 83-86)</blockquote>

<blockquote>X X X IN FINDING THE EXISTENCE OF
CONSPIRACY BETWEEN THE ACCUSED IN THE INSTANT CASE." (Appellant's Brief pp.
1-2; Rollo, pp. 35-36)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We shall first discuss the last three assignments of errors,
which all deal with the credibility of the complaining witness, Artemio
Fernando.</p>

<p class="BODY">To discredit the testimony of Artemio Fernando, the defense
pointed out before the trial court that in his affidavit, Exhibit
"1," executed before the police, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Fernando stated that he saw Armando
Marcos being chased by appellant Bernardo while in open court, he testified
that Marcos was held by said appellant.  The defense also contended that Fernando reported to the police
investigator, Quiterio Cuatrocruz that it was appellant Bernardo who killed
Marcos but in his sworn statement, Exhibit 2, he stated that it was appellant
Fabor who was the assailant.  (Appellants’ Brief, pp. 12-14; Rollo, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">pp. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">46-48) The trial court dismissed as “not crucial” the alleged
inconsistency between Fernando's testimony in open court on one hand and his
affidavit, Exhibit 1, and </span>the police report, Exhibit 2, on the other
hand, attributing it to the inaccuracy of the translation of Fernando's
testimony in the <u>Chavacano</u> dialect to English.  (Decision, p. 7; Rollo, 21) Besides, Fernando's statement in the
affidavit that he saw Marcos being chased by appellant Bernardo and his
statement in open court that he saw Marcos being held by said appellant, can be
reconciled inasmuch as it referred to sequential actions, <u>i.</u> <u>e</u>.
the victim was chased first and after being overtaken, was held by appellant
Bernardo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also makes capital out of the allegation in the
information that the two accused were "armed with a Batangas knife,"
meaning that there was only one weapon used in the killing.  So the defense argues, in an apparent
attempt to get appellant Fabor exculpated, that if appellant Fabor chased
Fernando while Marcos was being held by appellant Bernardo and appellant Fabor
gave up the chase when he was about 40 meters from the place where appellant
Bernardo was holding Marcos, appellant Fabor could not have been the one who
inflicted the fatal wound on Marcos.  The defense reasons out that Fernando was able to get the help of
several persons inside the billiard hall, who forthwith chased appellant Fabor,
and that the latter could not have inflicted the 12 wounds sustained by Marcos
while he was running away.  (Appellants'
Brief, pp. 16-18; Rollo, pp. 50-52)</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no need for the prosecution to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">pinpoint </span>who of the two appellants inflicted the fatal wounds on
Marcos after it was established by evidence that a conspiracy existed between
appellants to inflict the injuries on the victims.  Appellants waited for their victims, in a place which the latter
would pass on their way home.  Appellants started throwing stones simultaneously after the victims
passed by the place where appellants were waiting.  Each of the appellants performed his part to carry out the
criminal enterprise.  While appellant
Bernardo held on to Marcos, appellant Fabor chased Fernando.  The trial court, after hearing the testimony
of the prosecution witness, found that the appellants acted in concert to achieve
a common purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their first and second assigned errors, appellants seek to
negate the attendance of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">alevosia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span>which the trial court used to
qualify the offenses charged to murder and frustrated murder.  (Appellant's Brief, pp. 3-11; Rollo, pp.
38-45)</p>

<p class="BODY">Entrenched in our jurisprudence is the rule that the
circumstances which would qualify the killing to murder must be indubitably
proven as the crime itself (People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v. </span>Vicente,
146 SCRA 347 [1986]).  In <u>alevosia</u>,
it must first be proven that the offender consciously adopted the particular
means and methods to ensure the execution of the crime without risk to himself
(People v. Mabuhay, 185 SCRA 675 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, appellants initiated their attack on their
victims by throwing stones at them.  The
stoning therefore forewarned the victims of the impending attack and gave them
the chance to either prepare and defend themselves or to run away.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Fernando testified that he was confident <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>he and Marcos could outrun their
aggressors and that they were not in any danger.  (TSN, May 16, 1990, p. 14)</p>

<p class="BODY">As testified to by Dr. Efren Apolinario, a medico?legal
expert, the wounds sustained by Marcos were on the front portion of his body
except for the wound sustained in his right forearm and right deltoid
region.  (TSN, May 16, 1990, pp. 3-5) </p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that Fernando testified that the stoning came from
behind them and the wounds sustained by Marcos were inflicted frontally, it can
be deduced that Marcos stopped on his tracks and turned about to face his
assailant, instead of running away.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the wound sustained by Fernardo, it appears that
the same did not incapacitate him for more than one day as he was able to
report the incident to the Manicahan Police Station shortly after being treated
at the Zamboanga General Hospital.  (TSN, May 16, 1990, p. 12) If the wound was serious, Fernando could not
have run as fast and as far as he had described.  Likewise, if appellant Fabor intended to kill Fernando, he could
have stabbed the latter more than once or could have pursued him with more
vigor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of the qualifying circumstance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">alevosia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>appellants
can only be convicted of homicide and slight physical injuries.  The penalty for homicide under Article 249
of the Revised Penal Code is <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.  There being no mitigating nor aggravating
circumstance present, the maximum penalty to be imposed on the appellants
should be within the range of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its medium
period or 14 years, 8 months and 1 day to 17 years and 4 months.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
minimum period shall be within the range of the penalty next lower to that
prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for homicide which is <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>
or 6 years and 1 day to 12 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for slight physical injuries under Article 266 of the
Revised Penal Code is <u>arresto</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">menor</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The indemnity of P30,000 should be increased to P50,000 (People
v. Yeban, 190 SCRA 409 [1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds appellants guilty only of
homicide and sentences them to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">indeterminate
