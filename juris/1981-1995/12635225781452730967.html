Some years back, petitioner, a policeman of Malilipot, Albay, was 
suspended by respondent Mayor Marciano Bitara because of four criminal 
cases filed against him in the Municipal Court of Tabaco, Albay, to wit:
  assault upon an agent (another policeman) of a person in authority 
with homicide; less serious physical injuries thru reckless imprudence; 
illegal possession of firearm; and alarm and scandal.
<p>
Before the cases could be tried on the merits, the prosecution moved for
 their provisional dismissal on account of the desistance of the 
offended parties who had been paid by petitioner.  The motion was 
granted by the court.  Petitioner later sought a modification of the 
provisional dismissal to an absolute dismissal, which was also granted 
by the court.
</p><p>
Petitioner then filed with the Civil Service Commission a petition for 
reinstatement and payment of the salaries he failed to receive during 
his suspension, invoking the second paragraph of Section 16, Republic 
Act No. 4864, otherwise known as the Police Act of 1966, which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "When a member of the police force or agency is accused in court 
of any felony or violation of law x x x, the city mayor or municipal 
mayor concerned, shall immediately suspend the accused from office 
pending the final decision by the court, and <em>in case of acquittal, 
the accused shall be entitled to immediate reinstatement and the payment
 of the entire salary he failed to receive during his suspension</em> x x x." (Italics supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Civil Service Commission referred the matter to the Malilipot Mayor,
 who replied with a firm expression of his refusal to reinstate 
petitioner for the reason that there was actually no acquittal which 
could be the basis of petitioner's reinstate­ment with back salaries.  
While the matter was pending in the Commission, petitioner filed an 
action for mandamus in the Court of First Instance of Albay to compel 
reinstatement and payment of back salaries.  The court dismissed the 
action.  Hence this petition seeking reversal of the said decision.
</p><p>
The petition has no merit.  The law predicates reinstatement with 
entitlement to back salaries on "acquittal".  The dismissal of the 
criminal cases filed against petitioner after he had paid the offended 
parties, without trial on the merits, was not an acquittal.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is obvious that when the statute speaks of the suspended 
officer being 'acquitted' it means that after due hearing and 
consideration of the evidence against him the court is of the opinion 
that his guilt has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.  Dismissal 
of the case against the suspended officer will not suffice because 
dismissal does not amount to acquittal.  As aptly stated in People vs. 
Salico, 84 Phil. 722, 732-733 [1949]: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 'Acquittal is always based on the merits, that is, the defendant
 is acquitted because the evidence does not show that defendant's guilt 
is beyond a reasonable doubt; but dismissal does not decide the case on 
the merits or that the defendant is not guilty.  Dismissal terminates 
the proceeding, either because the court is not a court of compe­tent 
jurisdiction or the evidence does not show that the offense was 
committed within the territorial jurisdiction of the court, or the 
complaint or information is not valid or sufficient in form and 
substance, etc.  The only case in which the word dismissal is commonly 
but not correctly used, instead of the proper term acquittal, is when, 
after the prosecution has presented all its evidence, the defendant 
moves for the dismissal and the court dismisses the case on the ground 
that the evidence fails to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the 
defendant is guilty; for in such case the dismissal is in reality an 
acquittal because the case is decided on the merits.  If the prosecution
 fails to prove that the offense was committed within the territorial 
jurisdiction of the court and the case is dismissed, the dismissal is 
not an acquittal, inasmuch as if it were so the defendant could not be 
again prosecuted before the court of competent jurisdiction; and it is 
elemental that in such case the defendant may again be prosecuted for 
the same offense before a court of competent jurisdiction.' " (Malanyaon
 vs. Lising, 106 SCRA 237 at 239.) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is also noted that as regards the charge of assault upon an agent of a
 person in authority with homicide, the case was before the municipal 
court only for preliminary investigation.  Certainly, the petitioner 
could not have been acquitted therein.
</p><p>
Apart from the foregoing, petitioner has failed to exhaust 
administrative remedies before seeking judicial relief.  When he filed 
with the court a quo the case subject of the instant petition, his 
petition for reinstatement was pending in the Civil Service Commission, 
as it still is.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Melencio-Herrera, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
