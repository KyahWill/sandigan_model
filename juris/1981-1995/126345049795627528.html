				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two questions, as yet unresolved at the time of the filing of
this petition as well as at the time of its submission, called for its being
given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are (1) whether
the then Acting Secretary of Labor acted according to law in referring back an
appeal from an order of the Director of Labor Relations, requiring the holding
of a certification election to such official for him to decide and (2) whether
an employer has an interest cognizable in law to appeal from such order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second question had since then been
resolved, but the first has not as yet been given a definitive answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner as the employer filed this <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding assailing the actuation of the then Acting Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He referred back to the then Director of
Labor Relations, <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the appeal interposed by petitioner against an order declaring an existing
collective bargaining agreement as suspended subject to the outcome of the
certification election, required to be held within twenty days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis for such appeal was the existence
of a certified collective bargaining agreement which, in the opinion of petitioner,
should be given full force and effect rather than being suspended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a motion <span style="">for </span>reconsideration was denied, an appeal was taken to the then
Acting Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
contention of petitioner that there should be a decision by the Secretary or
Acting Secretary, instead of the appeal being sent to the very same official
who issued the order sought to be nullified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the answer filed on behalf of public respondents, such a procedure
was sought to be justified on the basis of one of the implementing rules
providing that the decision of the Bureau of Labor Relations in certification
matters should be final and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The then Acting Secretary <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, so it is argued,
"was completely justified in referring the case back to the Director of
Labor Relations for the latter to treat the same as a motion for reconsideration."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must be dismissed not in accordance with the above
view which raises a procedural due process question, but in accordance with
previous authoritative rulings (1) on the lack of interest of
petitioner-employer cognizable by law and (2) the necessity for the holding of
a certification election.</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
question of the assailed order of the then Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> reads as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Without waiving any of
our powers and duties under the Administrative Code [to] review any decision by
subordinate officials of this Depart­ment, it is our policy that this Office
will intervene in Med-Arbitration cases only where there is an imminent threat
to public order and stability or when, impelled by urgent public
considerations, the Secretary of Labor at his own initiative decides to review
decisions of the Bureau of Labor Relations."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The introductory phrase is correct insofar as it states categorically that the
Secretary of Labor then, the Minister of Labor now, is vested with the power of
reviewing "any decision by subordinate officials" and is free from
any objection when it was made clear that there was no waiver of such power,
with this qualification that a duty cannot be waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then came the statement of the policy of
non-intervention except in cases of "imminent threat to public order and
stability or when, impelled by urgent public considerations," such power
to review decisions of the Bureau of Labor Relations would be exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a limitation as a matter of policy may
be acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is this flaw,
however, from which it suffers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
appeal having been taken from an order of the Bureau of Labor Relations, there
was a duty cast upon the then Acting Secretary to pass on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could have affirmed what was done by his
subordinate, modified it, or reversed it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The tenor of his order being obviously the lack of an "imminent threat
to public order and stability" as well as of "urgent public
considerations," an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the appealed
decision was indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When, instead,
the matter was referred anew to the very same official, even if in the guise of
treating it as a motion for reconsideration, there was an affront to the concept
of procedural due process. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Considering
that the then Acting Secretary of Labor called on the Director of Bureau of
Labor Relations to review his own determination, the objection based on <span style="">due process ground cannot be brushed
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is impressed with merit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As is so well put in an oft-quoted legal
maxim:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Nemo</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>debet</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>esse</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judex</u></span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>propria</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As pointed out in the
opening paragraph of this opinion, this Court has authoritatively laid down the
controlling doctrine as to when an employer may have an interest sufficient in
law enabling him to contest a certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is relevance to this excerpt from
Consolidated Farms, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>"The record of this proceeding
leaves no doubt that all the while the party that offered the most obdurate
resistance to the holding of a certification election is manage­ment,
petitioner Consolidated Farms, Inc., II.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That circumstance of itself militated against the success of this
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a matter that should be the
exclusive concern of labor, the choice of a collective bargaining
representative, the employer is definitely an intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His participation, to say the least, deserves
no encouragement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court should be
the last agency to lend support to such an attempt at interference with a
purely internal affair of labor."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Reference was likewise made in the above decision to the earlier case of <span class="SpellE">Monark</span> International, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is true that there may be
circumstances where the interest of the employer calls for its being heard on
the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An obvious instance is where
it invokes the obstacle interposed by the contract-bar rule."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
There is nothing in its thirteen-page appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
to the Acting Secretary of Labor clearly indicative that the main reliance was
on the contract-bar rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All it alleged
was that there was an existing collective bargaining agreement and therefore it
would be "untimely" to hold a certification election.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
That clearly does not suffice to take this case out of <span style="">the operation of the authoritative doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the time that had elapsed since
1976 would make it manifest that</span><span style="">
a </span><span style="">certification election </span><span style="">is long overdue.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is equally
indubitable that the doubt sought to be cast on the authenticity of the signa­tures
appearing in the petition for certification election cannot be a bar to its
being granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption
that the evidence is clearly insufficient and the number of signatories less
than 30% that cannot militate against the favorable response to such petition
for certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far back
as Phil. Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU) v. Bureau of Labor Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1976 decision, this Court categorically held: "Petitioner's contention
to the effect that the 30% requirement should be satisfied suffers from an even
graver flaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It fails to distinguish
between the right of a labor organization to be able to persuade 30% of the
labor force to petition for a certification election, in which case respondent
Bureau is left with no choice but to order it, and the power of such
governmental agency precisely entrusted with the implementation of the
collective bargaining process to determine, consi­dering the likelihood that
there may be several unions within a bargaining unit to order such an election
precisely for the purpose of ascertaining, which of them shall be the exclusive
collective bargaining representative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of respondent Bureau of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1975</st1:date> was intended for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was why not only petitioner but also the
Philippine Federation of Labor, the National Labor Union, the National
Federation of Labor Unions and the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Kawani</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> AG&amp;P were
included in the list of labor unions that could be voted on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To reiterate a thought already expressed,
what could be more appropriate than such a procedure if the goal desired is to
enable labor to determine which of the competing organizations should represent
it for the purpose of a collective bargaining contract?"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
