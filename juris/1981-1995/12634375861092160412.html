<p class="BODY">When arraigned, Eddie Apawan and Ruben Sause pleaded not guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
They underwent trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that FE PALMON is a married woman and a mother
of five children.  She resides with her
family in Crossing Sulit, Polomolok, South Cotabato.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of September 19, 1985, Fe was at home looking after
her children.  That night, her mother,
Candelaria Junsay, and her younger brother's wife, Seremia Junsay, stayed with
her as her husband and younger brother were in Banga to harvest palay.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At around 10:00 P.M., Seremia heard someone forcing to open the
door leading to the kitchen.  She went
to the kitchen and saw that the kitchen door was being opened with a
knife.  Seremia hurriedly woke up Fe and
Candelaria.  They heard voices
downstairs.  The intruders were
saying:  "We are members of the <i><span style="">walay sapatos, abrehe kami." </span></i>Someone
<span style="">said </span>further:  "Allow us to go upstairs because we
want to eat." The intruders commanded the women to switch off the lights.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Fe followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) of the intruders, later identified as accused Ruben Sause
and Eddie Apawan, entered the kitchen.  Ruben was holding a flashlight.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
beam coming from the flashlight illuminated the area, allowing Fe, Candelaria,
and Seremia to see the faces of Ruben and Eddie.  Ruben's head was shaved, while Eddie, who was in fatigue uniform,
had long hair.  Armed with a knife,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Eddie immediately grabbed Fe, poked the knife at her neck and demanded fifty
thousand pesos (P50,000.00) from her.  When she denied having that sum of money, Eddie ordered her to open the <i><span style="">"aparador" </span></i><span style="">(cabinet), </span>but the latter only found
P100.00.  Upon searching the house,
Eddie and Ruben managed to take several items, <i><span style="">viz:</span></i><span style=""> a </span>wrist
watch, a cassette, <span style="">a </span>bag, a
blanket, a half sack of rice, some grocery items, and five hundred pesos
(P500.00) cash from Candelaria.  The
loot, valued at approximately five thousand two hundred five pesos (P5,205.00),
was gathered in the kitchen.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Eddie led Fe to the kitchen, saying he would tell her
about the "<i>way sapatos." </i>Apparently, Eddie had other sinister
intent in mind.  He made Fe sit on a
stool and threatened her to let him have sexual intercourse with him,
otherwise, he would kill her child.  Appalled, Fe was unable to speak.  Eddie then laid her on the floor and took her panty off.  He lifted her skirt and, without much ado,
mounted her.  They had coitus.  Fe was too nervous to remember for how long
Eddie stayed on top of her as his threat, that he would kill her child,
lingered on her mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> She
did not shout or resist, fearful that Eddie would kill her if she did.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
She could see Seremia and Candelaria, who were in the adjoining room barely two
(2) meters from her, but Ruben Sause was guarding them.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the rape, Ruben indiscriminately focused the flashlight
towards the kitchen, thus, albeit there was a "transparent" curtain
covering the door between the kitchen and the room where Candelaria and Seremia
had been kept at bay, they saw the bestial act.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Fifteen minutes later, Eddie and Fe emerged from the kitchen.  Fe was crying as she told Seremia and Candelaria
that she was raped.  They cried as they,
too, saw what happened.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the robbery and rape, accused-appellants left but warned
the three (3) women not to report the incident to the authorities, otherwise,
they would be killed.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That same evening, Candelaria, Seremia, Fe, and her children
proceeded towards the house of Fe's mother-in-law.  There, Fe recounted her ordeal to her mother in-law who advised
her not to immediately divulge her misfortune to her husband, Errol Palmon, as
he might take some drastic action on the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning, September 20, 1985, Fe reported the
robbery to the authorities but withheld the rape from them since her husband
had yet to be informed about it.  On
September 24, 1986, Fe, accompanied by her husband and her mother in-law,
reported the rape to the authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policeman Rodolfo Buenavidez investigated the case.  Among those he investigated <span style="">was </span>Eddie's wife, Jovelyn Apawan.  Upon Buenavidez’ request, Jovelyn handed to
Buenavidez <span style="">a </span>solo black and
white photograph of Eddie who was then in military uniform.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, said photograph was shown to Fe and she recognized Eddie as the
rapist.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants hoisted the defense of denial and alibi.  Eddie Apawan and Ruben Sause, both residents
of Barangay Sulit (proper), Polomolok, South Cotabato, claimed they were in
their respective houses when the incident happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruben averred he was sleeping in his house the night the robbery
and rape were committed <span style="">as </span>it <span style="">was already </span>late.  The following day, he <span style="">was </span>arrested by the authorities.  He denied knowing the complainant, Fe
Palmon, prior to the incident.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Eddie, for his part, alleged he stayed in his house, from 6:00
P.M. of September 19, 1985 until 6:00 A.M. the following morning, as his child
was sick.  He admitted having a fatigue
uniform, claiming he was a former member of the army.  In the early morning of September 20, 1985, he allegedly went to
the 3rd Infantry Battalion, in Polomolok.  He averred he was in the company of some CHDF members from said date
until his arrest on September 24, 1985.  At the police station, he met the victim for the first time, and the
victim cried upon seeing him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eddie's wife, Jovelyn, corroborated the testimony of her husband
that he stayed in their house the whole evening <span style="">of September 19, 1985 and left for the 3rd Infantry Battalion the
following morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court, in its Decision dated August 2,
1988, convicted Eddie Apawan and Ruben Sause of the complex crime of Robbery
with Rape.  The dispositive portion of
the Decision<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
of the trial court reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, finding the accused Eddie Apawan and Ruben Sause
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of robbery with rape
attended by the aggravating circumstances of nocturnity and abuse of superior
strength without being off-set (sic) by any mitigating circumstance, they are
both sentenced to suffer the supreme (sic) penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to
jointly and severally pay the aggrieved parties Fe Palmon and Candelaria Junsay
compensatory damages of P5,000.00, (and) moral damages to <i>(sic) </i>the rape
victim in the amount of P5,000.00 (sic) plus costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">These are the assigned errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT TAKING INTO
ACCOUNT THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT EDDIE APAWAN WAS NOT PUT IN A POLICE LINE-UP FOR
IDENTIFICATION BY THE OFFENDED PARTY BUT WAS INSTEAD IDENTIFIED THROUGH HIS
PICTURE SHOWN BY THE POLICE TO THE OFFENDED PARTY PRIOR TO HIS ARREST.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE
GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANTS FOR THE CRIME CHARGED WAS PROVEN (SIC) BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the judgment of conviction.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants claim they were not properly identified by
prosecution witnesses, <i><span style="">viz:  </span></i>Fe, Seremia, and Candelaria, as
there was no police line-up conducted before they were pinpointed as the
culprits.  Specifically, the defense
assails Eddie's identification, claiming that the act of Pat. Buenavidez, <i>i.e.</i>,
in borrowing Eddie's photograph and showing it to the victim, Fe, prior to Eddie's
arrest, was pointedly suggestive.  The
defense, <span style="">further alleges, that using
Eddie's picture for identification purposes departs from the standard police
procedure of placing the suspects in a police line-up to test the accuracy of
the offended party in identifying the real culprit.  We are not persuaded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no rule requiring that before a suspect can be
identified as the culprit, he should first be placed in a police line-up and
then pinpointed by the victim.  What is
important, is the positiveness of the victim that the persons charged were the
malefactors.  Such identification goes
to the credibility of the witness which was tested at the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have examined the records of this case and we agree with the
findings of the trial court on the positive identification of the
accused-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that accused-appellants stayed in the victim's
house for almost an hour.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
While searching for some valuables to rob, the flashlight held by Ruben Sause
was on, thus allowing prosecution witnesses Fe, Candelaria, and Seremia to see
the faces of accused-appellants.  Moreover, Eddie Apawan constantly held Fe close to him, particularly
during the rape, thus giving her enough time to take a good look at him.  As regards Ruben Sause, his shaved head left
a distinctive mark in the minds of the witnesses, not to mention that he, too,
was seen at close range by witnesses Seremia and Candelaria, while he was
keeping an eye on them during the rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have ruled that it is the most natural reaction for victims of
criminal violence to strive to see the appearance of their assailants and
observe the manner in which the crime was committed.  Most often, the face and body movements of the assailants create
a lasting impression which cannot be easily erased from their memory.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records are bereft of any evidence that the prosecution
witnesses have improper motives to falsely point to accused-appellants <span style="">as </span>the culprits.  Significantly, accused-appellants were not
known to these women prior to the incident.  Thus, we adhere to the established rule that in the absence of any
evidence to show that the witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by any
improper motive, <span style="">their identification
of the accused-appellants as the assailants should be given full faith and
credit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of Fe Palmon that she <span style="">was </span>raped by Eddie Apawan inspires belief as it <span style="">is </span>unlikely for her, a married woman
with five children, to contrive such a painful experience.  Her failure to resist during the carnal act
is of no moment since the rapist had already intimidated the victim with his
continued threats on the victim's life and children.  In this jurisdiction, the testimony of a woman, whose morality is
beyond dispute, carries a lot of weight.  For no decent Filipina would publicly admit that she has <span style="">been abused and ravished unless it </span>is <span style="">the truth.  Her natural instinct </span>is <span style="">to
protect her honor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Fe's conduct immediately after the assault, particularly, (1) in immediately
telling her sister in-law, Seremia, that she was raped, and (2) consulting her
husband's family on whether or not to inform her husband of the incident,
bolters her claim that the robbery was accompanied by rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the denial and alibi interposed by
accused-appellants fail to persuade us that they are innocent of the crime
imputed against them.  Alibi is a weak
defense, particularly, when it is not physically impossible for accused to be
at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bench, it was not physically impossible for accused-appellants
to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission as their houses
were only about one and one-half kilometers away from the residence of Fe
Palmon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court's conclusion that
accused-appellants are liable as co-conspirators considering these
circumstances:  (1) accused-appellants
acted in unison and cooperated with each other during the robbery; (2) while
Eddie was raping Fe, Ruben kept Seremia and Candelaria at bay, and he was
nonchalant; and (3) accused-appellants left together and warned the three (3)
women not to report the incident to the authorities.  Since conspiracy had been established, all the conspirators are
liable as co-principals regardless of the extent of their participation because
in contemplation of law, the act of one is the act of all.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All </span>things
considered, we hold that accused-appellants Ruben Sause and Eddie Apawan are
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with Rape, as defined in
Article 294 (2) of the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering the presence of aggravating circumstances of dwelling, nighttime,
and abuse of superior strength, without any mitigating circumstance to offset
the same, accused-appellants should be sentenced to death penalty.  In view, however, of the constitutional
prohibition on the imposition of death penalty,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
