seeks to annul and set aside the respondent Court of Appeals' April 29, 1980
decision and August 15, 1980 resolution in CA-G.R. No. 10081-SP, entitled
"Republic of the Philippines versus Hon. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, et al." -- a special action for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> -- sustaining the lower court's action in
dismissing petitioner's appeal as not having been perfected on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The root case is an expropriation proceedings initiated by the
petitioner over a 15,000 square meter lot of private respondents situated in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tikay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, docketed in the lower court as Civil Case No. 525,
entitled "Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Turandot</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldaba</span>, et

permanent site for the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Area Shop, Bureau of
Equipment, Department of Public Highways, a public purpose authorized by law to
be undertaken by the Ministry of Public Highways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="3">March
 2, 1978</st1:date>, the lower court issued a writ of possession placing the <span style="">petitioner in possession of the land in
question, upon its deposit of the amount of P7<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>
as provisional value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 31, 1978,
counsel for private respondents filed a motion praying for the creation of a
three (3) -man committee in accordance with Section 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of
Court, to study and submit a report as to the just and reasonable compensation
for the parcel of land subject of expropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="7"><span style="">July 31, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the lower court issued an order naming the

joint report to the lower court, recommending that the just compensation of the
expropriated land be fixed at P50.00 per square meter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this petition, the Solicitor General
claims that he was not served copies of the aforementioned March 31, 1978
motion of <span style="">private </span>respondents,
July 31, 1978 order of the respondent lower court and the November 17, 1978
report of the three-man committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records reveal that the Solicitor General authorized the provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> to represent him in <span class="GramE">that proceedings</span>
(pp. 11-12, <st1:country-region><st1:place>C.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, private
respondents in their comment to this <span class="GramE">petition,</span> alleged
"that the Provincial Fiscal, being duly authorized by the office of the
Solicitor General to represent the latter in this case, the court merely
furnished the office of the Provincial Fiscal with all the pleadings and other
papers of the case" (p. 53, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1978</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General received a copy of the lower court's order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>"The joint report filed by the three-man committee charged
with the determination of the just compensation of the property herein sought
to be condemned is hereby APPROVED, such that the just compensation of the land
described in Paragraph II of the Complaint is fixed at Thirty Pesos (P30.00)
per square meter.</blockquote>

Bank, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, Branch, the sum of P7,200.00 deposited

amount of P450,000.00 (15,000 square meters at P30.00 per square meter), which
the Department of Public Highways, Third Regional Equipment Services, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, shall,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1978</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General filed through the mail a <u>notice of appeal</u>, as well
as a <u>first motion for extension of time of 30 days</u> from <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1979</st1:date> within which to file

for was granted by the lower court in its order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 13, 1979, the lower court, acting upon petitioner's
manifestation filed on January 9, 1979 and motion filed on February 8, 1979,
allowed the Solicitor General to borrow the records of the expropriation case
"under proper receipt, the Clerk of Court taking the necessary steps to
index and number the pages thereof and to ensure its integrity; and granted a
second extension of thirty (30) days from February 17, 1979, within which to
file the record on appeal of the Republic of the Philippines" (p. 79, <span style="">C.A. </span>rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1979</st1:date>,
the lower court granted petitioner's third motion for an extension of thirty
(30) days from <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1979</st1:date>
within which to file its record on appeal (p. 80, C.A. rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the lower court, in an order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1980</st1:date>, acted favorably upon
petitioner's motion for a fourth extension of thirty (30) days from <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="4"><span style="">April </span>19,
 1979</st1:date> within which to file its record on appeal and petitioner's
request that the records of the expropriation case be forwarded to the
Solicitor General (p. 81, C.A. rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1979</st1:date>, the petitioner, invoking heavy pressure of work, asked
for a fifth extension of thirty (30) days from <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1979</st1:date> or <span style="">until

when its motion for a fifth extension has not yet been acted upon by the lower
court, petitioner filed its record on appeal (p. 13, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 15, 1979, eight (8) days after petitioner had filed its
record on appeal, private respondents filed an opposition to the aforesaid
fifth motion for extension (pp. 85-87, C.A. rec.), and an objection to
petitioner's record on appeal (pp. 88-89, C.A. rec.), on the ground that the
same was filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period,
because petitioner's motion dated May 17, 1979 for extension to file record on
appeal was mailed only on May 21, 1979 (pp. 13-14, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1979</st1:date>,
petitioner filed its opposition to the aforesaid objection to its record on
appeal, contending that the said <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1979</st1:date> motion for extension of time was actually mailed on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1979</st1:date>, which was the last day

lower court's order of </span><st1:date year="1979" day="24" month="4"><span style="">April 24, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> (p. 14, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an order dated August
13, 1979 but received by the Solicitor General only on September 10, 1979, the
lower court dismissed the appeal of petitioner on the ground that <u>the fifth
motion for extension </u></span><u>of time </u><u><span style="">dated May 17, 1979 within which to file the record on appeal</span></u><span style=""> and the record on appeal were filed </span>out
<span style="">of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court found that the said fifth
motion for extension of time was actually mailed on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="5"><span style="">May 21, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> and not on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> as claimed by petitioner (pp. 14, 34-35, <span class="GramE">rec</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of
dismissal reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Upon consideration of the approval of the record on appeal
filed by the Republic and acting on the manifestation filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1979</st1:date> by the defendants thru
counsel, the Court finds no merit in the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The last motion of the Office of the Solicitor General for
extension of time to file record on appeal was on May 17, 1979, seeking for an
additional extension of <span style="">thirty (30)
days from </span><st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="4"><span style="">April 18, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

expired on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this last request for extension was not
acted upon by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had therefore only up to <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1979</st1:date>,

</span>The record on appeal was filed only on <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1979</st1:date> (should be June 7), which is well beyond the
period to file record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the last motion for extension which was not acted upon by the
Court had only been filed on May 21, 1979 as shown by the stamp of the Manila
Post Office, the date of the mailing which should be reckoned with in computing
periods of mailed pleadings, and received by the Court on June 22, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both the motion for extension filed on May
21, 1979 and the record on appeal filed on June 11, 1979 (should be June 7),

period of 30 days from April 18, 1979, or up to May 18, 1979. </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1979, petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration
claiming that "1) there is merit in plaintiff's appeal from this Honorable
Court's order of December 8, 1978, a copy of which was received on December 18,
1978; 2) plaintiff's May 17, 1979 motion for 30 days extension from May 17,
1979 to file Record on Appeal, was actually filed on May 18, 1979; and 3) the
Honorable Court denied plaintiff's appeal without first resolving plaintiff's
motion for a 30-day extension, from May 18, 1979 to file Record on Appeal"
(pp. 14-15, rec.; pp. 52-66, C.A. rec.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Relative to the timeliness of the filing of its fifth motion for
extension of time, petitioner submitted a certification of the Postmaster of
the Central Office of the Bureau of Posts, Manila, that registered letter No.
3273 containing the aforesaid motion addressed to the Clerk of Court of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> was received by this Office late Friday afternoon, <span style="">May </span><span style="">18, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The letter was not included in the only morning dispatch of May 19 to <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and was dispatched </span><st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="5"><span style="">May 21, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, Monday (May 20 being a Sunday) under the
Manila-<span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> Bill No. 202, page 1, line 15"
(p. 66, C.A. rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the merits of the dismissed appeal, petitioner stressed that
the creation of a three-man committee to fix the just compensation of the expropriated
lot was without legal basis, because Section 5, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court
upon which the same was anchored had already been repealed by the provisions of
Presidential Decree No. 76 which took effect on December 6, 1972 -- under which
the court has no alternative but to base the just compensation of expropriated
property upon the current and fair market value declared by the owner or
administrator, or such market value as determined by the assessor, whichever is
lower.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1979</st1:date>,
the lower court denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration for lack of
merit (pp. 36-40, rec.; pp. 28-32, <st1:country-region><st1:place>C.A.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
rec.), thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The grounds advanced by the <st1:place><st1:placename>plaintiff</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Republic</st1:placetype></st1:place> of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
have been fully taken into account by the Court in its order of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1979</st1:date>, particularly the
late filing of the record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's counsel should not have assumed that the motion for
extension of the period for filing of the record on appeal would be granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff's counsel's belief that their May 17, 1979
motion would be granted cannot be the basis for the plaintiff to be absolved of
the effect of late filing of the record on appeal, considering that the<span style=""> </span>Court had
liberally extended for five times **, each for thirty (30) days, the filing of
said record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court considers said
extensions as sufficient time for the counsel for plaintiff to prepare its
record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's counsel,
with all the resources it has, to protect its client's interests, should have
been vigilant enough not to assume and should not expect that their motion for
extension would be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
correct therefore that only three days had elapsed after the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to perfect appeal because the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period ended not on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1979</st1:date>, but on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1979</st1:date>, because the last motion for
extension was not granted by the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court deplores the insinuation of plaintiff's counsel
that it took hook, line and sinker, defendant's allegation about the fact of
mailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has carefully gone over the
record and found that the date of mailing of the motion for extension is May
21, 1979, as shown by the stamp 'Registered, Manila, Philip­pines, May 21,
1979’ appearing on the covering envelope containing the motion for
extension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the explanation
contained in Annex B of the motion for reconsideration to the effect that
registered Letter No. 3273, addressed to the Clerk of Court, Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
was received by the Manila Post Office late Friday afternoon, May 18, 1979, but
was not included in the 'only' morning dispatch of May 19 to <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and was dispatched May 21, 1979, Monday (May 20
being a Sunday), under the Manila-<span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> Bill No.
202, page 1, line 15', can not overturn the fact of date of actual mailing which
is May 21, 1979, because it is of judicial knowledge that a registered letter
when posted is immediately stamped with the date of its receipt, indicating
therein the number of the registry, both on the covering envelope itself and on
the receipt delivered to the person who delivered the letter to the post
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four (4) times only; 5th
extension was not acted upon by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The letter Annex B of the motion
therefore lacks sufficient weight and persuasiveness to prove the fact that the
letter asking for another extension was actually filed on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="5"><span style="">May 18,
 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, and not </span><st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="5"><span style="">May 21,
 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Regarding the creation of a three-man committee which
according to plaintiff the Court sorely lacked the prerogative to create
pursuant to Sec. 5, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court because it has been
superseded by the provisions of PD 76 which definitely fixed the guidelines for
the determination of just compensation of private property acquired by the
State for public use, the Court had to resort to this old method of determining
fair market value, which is defined as:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The "current and fair market value" shall be understood
to mean the "price of which a willing seller would sell and a willing
buyer would buy neither being under abnormal pressure',</p>

show evidence thereof as declared by the owner or administrator of the property
under the provisions of PD 76, or the valuation or assessment of the value as
determined by the assessor, whichever is lower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, for all intents and purposes, the findings of the three-man
committee have become the basis of the valuation, Paragraph III of the
complaint notwithstanding, because <span class="GramE">allegation in the complaint,

dismissed herein petitioner's appeal on the bases of the foregoing provisions
upon its finding that the record on appeal of petitioner was filed out of time

the last day of the appeal period as extended; petitioner's fifth extension of

implication of the questioned orders of the Court of First Instance is that
since the fifth extension of time was filed out of time, no action may be taken

letter was not included in the only morning dispatch of May 19, to <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and was dispatched <st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1979</st1:date>, Monday (May 20 being a Sunday) under the
Manila-<span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> Bill No. 202, page 1, line 15."</p>

<p class="BODY">But the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
opined that said certification cannot override the prevailing practice in post
offices "that a registered letter when posted is immediately stamped with
the date of its receipt, indicating therein the number of the registry, both on
the covering envelope itself and on the receipt delivered to the person who
delivered the letter to the office" of which it took judicial notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE entertain grave doubts that the aforesaid post office practice
is a proper subject of judicial notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Rule 129 on judicial notice provides that "The
existence and territorial extent of states, their forms of government and
symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts
of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the
Philippines, the official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments of the Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, the
geographical divisions and political history of the world and all similar
matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable
demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial
functions, shall be judicially recognized by the court without the introduction
of proof; but the court may receive evidence upon any of the subjects in this
section stated, when it shall find it necessary for its own information, and
may resort for its aid to appropriate books or documents or reference."</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the post office practice of which the Court of First
Instance took judicial notice is not covered by any of the specific instances
cited <span style="">above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Neither can it be classified under
"matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable
demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial
functions x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." For
a matter to be taken judicial notice of by the courts of law, it must be a
subject of common and general knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, judicial notice of facts is measured by general
knowledge of the same facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fact is
said to be generally recognized or known when its existence or operation is
accepted by the public without qualification or contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test is whether the fact involved is so
notoriously known as to make it proper to assume its existence without
proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a belief is not
universal, however, is not controlling for it is very seldom that any belief is
accepted by everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that
the matters are familiarly known to the majority of mankind or those persons
familiar with the particular matter in question (20 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>
49-50; Martin, Rules of Court 37, Second Edition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, a matter may be personally known
to the judge and yet not be a matter of judicial knowledge and vice versa, a
matter may not be actually known to an individual judge, and nevertheless be a
proper subject of judicial cognizance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The post office practice herein involved is not tested by the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> considerations, a proper matter of judicial
notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the certification
issued by the very postmaster of the post office where the letter containing
the questioned motion for extension of time was posted, is a very clear
manifestation that the said post office practice is not of unquestionable
demonstration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the doctrine of
judicial notice rests on the wisdom and discretion of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to take judicial notice is to be
exercised by the courts with caution; care must be taken that the requisite
notoriety exists; and every reasonable doubts upon the subject should be
promptly resolved in the negative (31 CJS 522; Martin, Rules of Court 38,
Second Edition).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore manifest from the foregoing that the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> committed a palpable error
amounting to a grave abuse of discretion in relying on the alleged post office
practice aforementioned over the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
certification of the postmaster earlier referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That being so, the
dismissal of petitioner's appeal therefore lacks factual basis.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should have acted on petitioner's fifth
motion for extension of time which <span style="">WE </span>find
to have been filed on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that a favorable action on the aforesaid fifth
motion for extension of time is warranted by the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the record on appeal was filed by
petitioner even before the lower court could consider the questioned motion for
extension of time; and private respondents objected to the said motion only
after petitioner had filed the record on appeal; (2) the order of the lower
court granting the fourth extension of time did not contain any <u>caveat</u>
that no further extension shall be allowed; (3) the fact that the CFI records of
the case were sent to the Solicitor General only on May 3, 1979 and ostensibly
handed to the Solicitor assigned to the case only on May 16, 1979 or barely two
(2) days Wore the expiration of the extended appeal period; and (4) pressure of
work in the undermanned Office of the Solicitor General who is the counsel of
the National Government and all other governmental agencies <span style="">and instrumentalities; and (5) and the
unconscionable amount of P450,000.00 for a parcel of 1.5 hectares </span>situated
in a barrio of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
with only a provisional value of P7,200.00 obviously based upon its assessed
value appearing on its tax declaration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No sugar, rice or coconut land of only 15,000 square meters could
command such a fabulous price.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE therefore rule that the respondent Court of Appeals gravely
abused its discretion in affirming the disputed orders of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<blockquote>II. But even assuming that the motion for extension to file record
on appeal dated May 17, 1979 was filed not on May 18, 1979 but on May 21, 1979
as claimed by private respondents, which is a delay of only one (1) working
day, May 19 and 20 being Saturday and Sunday, respectively, that circumstance
alone would not justify the outright dismissal of the appeal of petitioner Republic
of the Philippines, especially so in the light of the undisputed fact that
petitioner had already filed with the lower court the record on appeal at the
time the questioned dismissal order was issued by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, as ruled in one case, "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
the delay of four days in filing a notice of appeal and a <u>motion for an
extension of time to file a record on appeal can be excused on the basis of
equity and considering that the record on appeal is now with the respondent
judge</u>" (Ramos vs. <span class="SpellE">Bagasao</span>, et al., G.R. No.
51552, February 28 1980, Second Division; emphasis supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, WE have already liberalized in a
number of cases the jurisprudence on the matter of perfection of appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, in De <span class="SpellE">las</span>
Alas vs. Court of Appeals (83 SCRA 200-216 [1978]), WE ruled that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
litigation should, as much as possible, be decided on their merits and not on
technicality, and under the circumstances obtaining in this case, WE said in
the case of Gregorio vs. Court of Appeals (L-43511, July 23, 1976, 72 SCRA 120,
126), thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> Dismissal of appeals purely on
technical grounds is frowned upon where the policy of the courts is to
encourage hearing of appeals on their merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rules of procedure ought not to be applied in a very rigid, technical
sense; rules of procedure are used only to help secure, not override,
substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a technical and
rigid enforcement of the rules is made, their aim would be defeated.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE"><span style="">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>III. Moreover, a special circumstance which is the subject of one
of the main issues raised by petitioner in its appeal warrants US to exercise
once more OUR exclusive prerogative to suspend OUR own rules or to exempt a
particular case from its operation as in the recent case of Republic of the
Philippines vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (83 SCRA 459, 478-480 [1978]), thus:
"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The Rules have
been drafted with the primary objective of enhancing fair trials and expediting
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a corollary, if their
application and operation tend to subvert and defeat instead of promote and
enhance it, their suspension is justified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the words of Justice Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in <span class="GramE">his concurring</span> opinion in Estrada vs. <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Domingo, '(T<span class="GramE">)his</span> Court, through the revered and
eminent Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, found occasion in
the case of C. <span class="SpellE">Viuda</span> de <span class="SpellE">Ordoverza</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, to lay down for recognition in holding
that ‘ “<u>it is always in the power of the court (Supreme Court) to suspend
its own rules or to except a particular case from its operation, whenever
the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>purposes of justice require it</u>
…… <span class="GramE">' "</span> (underscoring ours).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As emphasized by the Solicitor General, if
the questioned orders are not annulled and set aside, its enforcement and
implementation will result to the prejudice of, and irreparable injury to, public
interest." This is so because the Government would lose its opportunity to
assail the order of the lower court dated <st1:date month="12" day="8" year="1978">December 8, 1978</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads, as follows:</blockquote>
