Judge Francisco C. <span class="SpellE">Pedrosa</span>, convicted Vicente <span class="SpellE">Managbanag</span>, appellant herein, of the crime of Rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, this Court renders
judgment finding the accused, VICENTE MANAGBANAG, GUILTY beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of Rape, as defined and penalized under Article 335,
Paragraph 6 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, and sentences him to suffer
and undergo imprisonment of (RECLUSION PERPETUA).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused is further ordered to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">indemnify the offended party, MARIETA NOVAL,
in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and </span>to pay the
costs of this action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in arriving at the conviction, relied heavily on
the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> </span>testimony of the offended
party, <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Noval</span>, a
girl barely 14 years old at the time her humiliating and painful defloration
took place in the hands of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The date was <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="1">January 10,
 1982</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time>,
when the appellant <span class="GramE">requested</span> <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span>
to cover with soil the excrement of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
mother-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(A hole was carved on the
floor of the sick woman's room for her waste discharge which spilled underneath
the house).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span>
proceeded to perform the task, the appellant followed her beneath the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With a bolo in
one hand which he wielded to threaten the girl with death.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>("If you shout, I will stab you.") <span class="GramE">the</span> appellant drove the girl to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ground, then removed her clothing, covered her mouth with his left hand
and "even put a piece of cloth over her mouth," and forcibly had
carnal knowledge of her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Traumatized by the experience and fearful for her life, the girl
ran towards the town plaza where she concealed herself for two days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An elder sister finally brought the
bewildered girl to their aunt's house in <span class="SpellE">Batuan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marieta's</span> father,
as soon as he was informed of his daughter's sorry plight, reported the
incident to the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marieta</span> was also subjected to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a medical </span>examination on <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="1">January
 12, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereupon, a complaint for rape was filed by <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span>
on <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After tria<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">l</span>, the appellant was convicted of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the appellant assigns the following errors, to
wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE PROSECUTION EVIDENCE
STRONGLY AND SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THE COMMISSION OF THE CRIME CHARGED, BECAUSE
IT OVERLOOKED CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT AND MATERIAL CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THE
VERSION ADVANCED BY THE COMPLAINANT AND THE CORROBORATIVE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT ERRED IN ITS EVALUATION OF THE DEFENSE EVIDENCE,

THE EVIDENCE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE CRIME CHARGED WAS PROVEN
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is sufficient evidence on record pointing to the guilt
beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the
contention of the appellant, it was not impossible for the rape to have taken
place at the time and place mentioned by the offended party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The area beneath the appellant's house was
fenced by wooden slats which provided enough cover that made it improbable even
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for people standing a short distance a</span>way
to see through,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">much less for people who were just
passing by.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, were it possible to
look through the fenced area if one purposely did so, the offended party
affirmed that there was nobody in sight at the moment she was ravished, and
that the windows and doors of the neighboring houses were closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, we believe, for </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> is usually siesta time and people rarely go
to the beach (the house, under which the rape was committed, is along the way
to the beach) to swim at such an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, the presence of people in <span class="GramE">a certain</span>
vicinity does not preclude the commission of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime may be committed even at a place
where people usually pass by.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As regards the testimony
of the examining physician, we find no cogent reason to doubt its
veracity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The physician's declaration as
to the presence of</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lacerations
as well </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">spermatozoa in the
genitalia of the offended party need not be corroborated by the medical
technologist for it must be presumed that the doctor, in the performance of his
official duty, has verified the facts on which he testified in open court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as a medical practitioner, he must
also be presumed to be competent to testify on what he has actually
examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, we have held that
a medical certificate is not indispensable to prove the commission of rape.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> In many instances, a medical certificate has
been construed by courts to merely amplify the </span>case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for the prosecution especially where the
testimony of the offended party is highly credible, as in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of the
witnesses for the defense were correctly disregarded by the trial court:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

urge<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>upon this Court for the exculpation
of the accused do not meet the quantum of evidence necessary to overthrow the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evidence of the prosecution, which evidence
is beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The theory
of the defense is merely one of denial and further that the crime of rape could
not have been committed due to the fact that there were many persons present
allegedly at the time of the incident."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The allegations that <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span> fled because she was caught by the appellant's wife
stealing eggs and further, that the rape case was filed to cover up the
stealing incident were obvious concoctions by a man desperate to evade
punishment for his crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A rape charge is a
serious matter with pernicious consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It exposes both the accused and the accuser to humiliation, fear, and
anxieties, not to mention the stigma of shame that both have to bear for the
rest of their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore,
inconceivable for a chaste girl and her parents to devise a scheme which shall
cast a cloud upon the girl's honor if only for a trifling reason as stealing
eggs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court, in
giving credence to and relying mainly on the testimony of the offended party,
said:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the direct examination of the offended party, she spoke in
such a low voice, casting her eyes down to the floor and barely whispering her
answers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had to be prodded
constantly in order to elicit answers from her to questions of the Fiscal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The offended party, most of the time, had
downcast eyes and occasional bouts of crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But on cross-examination, in spite of a grueling cross-examination by
the learned counsel for the defense, the dam of remorse which had been held
back by the timidity of a girl 14 years of age finally broke, and her torrent
of answers almost overwhelmed the questions of the Cross-examiner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court noted that her answers on cross-examination were answers
which should have been given on direct examination, but were withheld by the
dam of timidity of a fourteen-year-old minor who had been deflowered of her
maidenhood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On cross-examination, she
engaged the Cross-examiner in a display of candor in answering the hardest
questions thrown at her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Conviction by the trial court of the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>rape cases based on the sole
testimony of the offended party has, in quite a number of instances, been
sustained by us on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court is in the best position to assess the demeanor of the witnesses and such
assessment has been accorded the highest respect by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Marieta</span>
was sufficiently corroborated by the testimony of the examining physician as
well as the blood-stained shorts and underwear, her injuries and the presence
of spermatozoa.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of all the foregoing, we can not find any reason to change
the decision of the trial court except to increase the indemnity adjudged to
P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from P12,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>decision
appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED with regard to the penalty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>RECLUSION PERPETUA but MODIFIED as
