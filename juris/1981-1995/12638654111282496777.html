<p class="BODY">In a lengthy and voluminous petition, dwelling largely on facts,
petitioner Union of <span class="SpellE">Filipro</span> Employees and 70 union
officers and a member (henceforth "UFE") maintain that public
respondent NLRC had acted with grave abuse of discretion in its <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the decisions of the Labor Arbiters <u>a quo</u>,
declaring illegal the strikes staged by UFE.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent NLRC premised its decision on the following sets of
facts:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>In</u></span><u>
NCR 12-4007-85 and NCR 1-295-86</u>:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">UFE filed a notice of strike on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1985</st1:date> (BLR-NS-11-344-85) with the Bureau of
Labor Relations against <span class="SpellE">Filipro</span> (now Nestle
Philippines, Inc., ["Nestle"]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On December 4, 1988, UFE filed a complaint for Unfair Labor Practice
(ULP) against Nestle and its officials for violation of the Labor Code (Art.
94) on Holiday Pay, non-implementation of the CBA provisions (Labor Management
Corporation scheme).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Financial
Assistance and other unfair labor practice (p. 381, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on <span class="SpellE">Nestle's</span> petition seeking
assumption of jurisdiction over the labor <span class="GramE">dispute <span style="">&nbsp;</span>or</span> its certification to the NLRC for
compulsory arbitration, then Minister of Labor and Employment <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> assumed
.jurisdiction over the dispute and issued the following order on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1985</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Office hereby assumes jurisdiction over the
labor dispute at <span class="SpellE">Filipro</span>, Inc. pursuant to Article

disrupt company operations, are strictly enjoined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let a copy of this Order be published in three (3) conspicuous
places inside company premises for strict compliance of all concerned."
(p. 381-382, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 20, 1985, UFE filed a petition for certiorari with
prayer for issuance of temporary restraining order, with this Court (G.R. No.
73129) assailing the assumption of jurisdiction by the Minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the automatic injunction
against any concerted activity, and an absence of a restraining order, the
union members, at the instigation of its leaders, and in clear defiance of
Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople's</span> Order of December 11, 1985, staged a
strike and continued to man picket lines at the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Administrative Office and all of <span class="SpellE">Nestle's</span> factories
and warehouses at <span class="SpellE">Alabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>,

</span>Likewise, the union officers and members distributed leaflets to
employees and passersby advocating a boycott of company products (p. 383, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1986, Nestle filed a petition to declare the
strike illegal (NCR-1-295-86) premised on violation of the CBA provisions on
"no strike/no lockout" clause and the grievance machinery provisions
on settlement of disputes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1986, then Labor Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>
issued another Order, with this disposition:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in line with the Order of December 11, 1985, this
Office hereby orders all the striking workers to report for work and the
company to accept them under the same terms and conditions prevailing before
the work stoppage within forty eight (48) hours from notice of this Order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Director of Labor Relations is designated to immediately
conduct appropriate hearings and meetings and submit his recommendations to
enable this Office to decide the issues within thirty (30) days." (p. 383,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite receipt of the second order dated January 30, 1986, and
knowledge of a notice caused to be published by Nestle in the Bulletin on
February 1, 1986, advising all workers to report to work not later than
February 3, 1986, the officers and members of UFE continued with the strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1986, the Minister B. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>
denied their motion for reconsideration of the return-to-work order portion as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the motion for reconsideration is hereby denied
and no further motion of similar nature shall be entertained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The parties are further enjoined from committing acts that
will disrupt the peaceful and productive relations between the parties while
the dispute is under arbitration as well as acts considered illegal by law for
the orderly implementation of this Order like acts of coercion, harassment,
blacking of public thoroughfares, ingress and egress to company premises for
lawful purposes or those undertaken without regard to the rights of the other
party.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Police and military <span class="GramE">authorities</span> site
requested to assist in the proper and effective implementation of this Order.”
(p. 384, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">UFE defied the Minister and continued with their strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestle filed criminal charges against those
involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 13, 1986, the new Minister of Labor and Employment, <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> B. Sanchez, issued a Resolution, the relevant
portions of which stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>"This Office hereby enjoins all striking workers to
return-to-work immediately and management to accept them under the same terms
and conditions prevailing previous to the work stoppage except as qualified in
this resolution. the management of Nestle Philippines is further directed to
grant a special assistance as suggested by this Ministry in an order dated 30
January 1986 to all striking employees covered by the bargaining units at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>, City in an amount equivalent to their weighted average
monthly basic salary, plus the cash conversion value of the vacation leave
credits for the year 1986, payable not later than five (5) days from the date
of the actual return to work by the striking workers." (p. 385, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On March 17, 1986, the strikers returned to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 31, 1986, we granted <span class="SpellE">UFE’s</span>
Motion to Withdraw its Petition for Certiorari (G.R. No. 73129) (p. 385, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 23, 1986, Minister Sanchez rendered a Decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Union charge for unfair labor practices is hereby
dismissed for want of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nestle
Philippines is hereby directed to make good its promise to grant an additional
benefit in the form of bonus equivalent to one (1) month's gross compensation
to all employees entitled to the same in addition to the one-month weighted
average pay granted by this office in the return-to-work Order." (p. 786, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 6, .1986, Minister Sanchez modified the foregoing
decision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, our 23 April 1986 Decision is hereby modified as
fallows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">NestIe</span> Philippines is directed to pay the Anniversary bonus
equivalent to one month basic salary to all its employees in lieu of the one

<p class="BODY">At the outset, UFE Questions the power of the Secretary of Labor
under Art. 263(g) of the Labor Code to assume jurisdiction over a labor dispute
tainted with national interests, or to certify the same for compulsory
.arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>UFE contends that Arts.
263 and 264 are based on the 1973 Constitution, specifically Sec. 9 of Art. II

<p class="BODY">UFF argues that since the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
provision of Sec. 9 is no longer found in the 1987 Constitution, Arts. 263 (g)
and 264 of the Labor Code are now unconstitutional and must be ignored."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
agree with the Solicitor General that on the contrary, both provisions are
still applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"Article 7 of the New Civil Code declares that:</blockquote>

(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) of Articles 263 of the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, it must be noted that Articles 263 (q) and 264

general welfare of society (People vs. Vera Reyes, 67 Phil. 190).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police power, together with the power of
eminent domain and the power of taxation, is an inherent power of government
and does not need to ' be expressly conferred by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is submitted that the argument of
petitioners that Articles 263 (g) and 264 of the Labor Code do not have any
constitutional foundation is legally inconsequential." (pp. 801-803, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of the legality of the strike committed, UFE seeks
to absolve itself by pointing out qualifying factors such as motives, good
faith, absence of findings on specific participation and/or liability, and
limiting the no-strike provision to economic strikes.</p>

<p class="BODY">UFE completely misses the underlying principle embodied in Art.
264(g) on the settlement of labor disputes and this <span class="GramE">is,</span>
that assumption and certification orders are <span class="SpellE"><u>executory</u></span><u>
in character</u> and are to be <u>strictly complied</u> with by the parties
even during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of any petition questioning
their validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This extraordinary
authority given to the Secretary of Labor is aimed at arriving at a peaceful
and speedy solution to labor disputes, without jeopardizing national interests.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regardless therefore of their motives, or the validity of their
claims, the striking workers must cease and/or desist from any and all acts
that tend to, or undermine this authority of the Secretary of Labor, once an
assumption and/or certification order is issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot, for instance, ignore
return-to-work orders, citing unfair labor practices on the part of the
company, to justify their actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the NLRC, in its decision, re-emphasized the nature of a return-to work order
within the context of Art. 264(g) as amended by BP Nos. 130 and 227:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"One other point that must be underscored is that the
return-to-work order is issued pending the determination of the legality or
illegality of the strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is not
correct to say that it may be enforced only if the strike is legal and may be
disregarded if the strike is illegal</u>, for the purpose precisely is to
maintain the status quo while the determination is being made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the workers who contend that their
strike is legal can refuse to return to work to their work and cause a standstill
on the company operations while retaining the positions they refuse to
discharge or allow the management to fill.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, they will also claim payment for work not done, on the ground
that they are still legally employed although actually engaged in activities
inimical to their employer's interest. (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is like eating one’s cake and having it too, and at the
expense of the management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
unfair situation surely was not contemplated by our labor laws and cannot be justified
under the social justice policy, which is a policy of fairness to both labor
and management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can this
unseemly arrangement be sustained under the due process clause as the order, if
thus interpreted, would be plainly oppressive and arbitrary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"

Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. 77567, 27 June 88, 162
SCRA 676).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The return to work order does not so much <u>confer a right
as it imposes a duty; and while as a right, it may be waived</u>, it must be
discharged as a duty even against the worker's will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Returning to work in this situation is not a
matter of option or <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> but of
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The worker must return to
his job together with his co-workers so the operations of the company can be
resumed and it can continue serving the public and promoting its
interest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We also wish to point out that an assumption and/or certification
order of the Secretary of Labor automatically results in a return-to-work of
all striking workers, whether or not a corresponding order has been issued by
the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
striking workers erred when they continued with their strike alleging absence
of a return-to-work order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
264(g) is clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once an
assumption/certification order is issued, <span class="GramE">strikes are
enjoined, or if one has</span> already taken place, all strikers <u>shall
immediately</u> return to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">A strike that is undertaken despite the issuance by the Secretary
of Labor of an assumption or certification order becomes a <u>prohibited</u> <u>activity</u>
and thus illegal, pursuant to the second paragraph of Art. <span class="GramE">264
of the Labor Code as amended (<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Wood
Products, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. 82088, October 13, 1989; 178 SCRA 482).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Union officers and members, as a result,
are deemed to have lost their employment status for having knowingly
participated in an illegal act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC also gave the following reasons:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The strike was staged in violation of the
existing CBA provisions on "No Strike/No Lockout Clause" stating that
a strike, which is in violation of the terms of the collective bargaining
agreement, is illegal, especially when such terms provide for conclusive
arbitration clause (Liberal Labor Union vs. Phil. Can Co., 91 Phil. 72; Phil.
Airlines vs. PAL Employees Association, L-8197, October 31, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main purpose of such an agreement is to
prevent a strike and it must, therefore, be adhered to strictly and respected
if their ends are to be achieved (pp. 397-398, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead of exhausting all the steps provided
for in the grievance machinery provided for in the collective bargaining
agreement to resolve the dispute amicably and harmoniously within the plant
level, UFE went on strike (p. 398, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prescribed mandatory cooling-off period
and then 7-day strike and after submission of the report of strike vote at <span class="SpellE">Nestle's</span> <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Offices and <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span> Plants
were not complied with (NLRC-NCR-12-4007-85 &amp; NCR-1-295-86), while no
notice of strike was filed by respondents when they staged the strike at <span class="SpellE">Nestle's</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Plant (RABX-2-0047-86) contrary to the pertinent
provision of Articles 263 and 264 of the Labor Code, emphasizing that "the
mandatory character of these cooling-off periods has already, been
categorically ruled upon by the Supreme Court" (National Federation of
Sugar Workers (NFSW) vs. <span class="SpellE">Ovejera</span>, et al., 114 SCRA
354) (p. 402, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In carrying out the strike, coercion, force,
intimidation, violence with physical injuries, sabotage, and the use of
unnecessary and obscene, language or epithets were committed by the respondent
officials and members of either UFE or WATU.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is well-settled that a strike conducted in this manner is illegal
(United Seamen's Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> <span class="SpellE">Shipowners</span>
Association, 20 SCRA 1226). In fact, criminal cases were filed with the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office (p. 402, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the NLRC correctly upheld the illegality of the strikes and
the corresponding dismissal of the individual complainants because of their
"brazen disregard of successive lawful orders of then Labor Ministers Blas
F. Ople, Augusto Sanchez and Labor Secretary Franklin Drilon dated December 11,
1985, January 30, 1986 and February 4, 1986, respectively, and the cavalier
treatment of the provisions of the Labor Code and the return-to-work orders of
the Minister (now Secretary) of Labor and Employment, or Articles 264 and 265
(now renumbered Arts. 263 and 264), providing in part as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the alleged lack of jurisdiction of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">lubaton</span>, NLRC has clarified that the question on the
legality of strike was properly resolved by the Labor Arbiter, not only because
the question is perfectly within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the
Labor Arbiter to adjudicate, but also because the issue was <u>not subsumed</u>
by the Order o-f Labor Minister Sanchez, dated December 23, 1986, certifying
the Notice of Strike dated December 4, 1986 for compulsory arbitration, further
clarifying that the issue of whether or not the strike staged on September 11,
1987 by UFE and its officials and members was illegal is a <u>prejudicial
question</u> to the issue of whether or not the complainants were illegally
dismissed. We shall not belabor the issue any further.</p>

<p class="BODY">ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DISMISSED, and the decision of
public respondent-NLRC, dated November 2, 1988, and its Resolution, dated March
7, 1989, are both AFFIRMED, in their entirety. No costs.</p>
