				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Sasi</span> was convicted of serious physical injuries by the
Municipal Court of San Joaquin, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
in Criminal Case No. 911.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was meted
"an indeterminate sentence of two (2) years and four (4) months to six (6)
years" and ordered to pay damages and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He applied for <span class="GramE">probation</span>
but his application was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went
to the Court of Appeals on <i>certiorari</i> alleging that the municipal judge
committed a grave <span style="">abuse of discretion
in denying his application for probation; he </span>prayed that he be admitted
to probation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
Court of Appeals in CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.</span> SP-10077-R
denied the petition for <i>certiorari</i>; hence the instant petition which
would have <span class="GramE">Us</span> reverse the decision of the Court of
Appeals and admit the petitioner to proÂ­bation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After receiving the comment of the Solicitor General on the
petition with the recommendation that the petition be dismissed for lack of
merit, <span class="GramE">We</span> received a letter from Municipal Judge David
A. <span class="SpellE">Alfeche</span>, Jr. of <st1:place>San Joaquin</st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, informing that the petitioner
had been granted parole by the Board of Pardons and Parole on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1980</st1:date>. As a result <span class="GramE">We</span> directed the petitioner to comment on the letter and to
state whether his appeal should be considered moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's counsel has filed a manifestation
which states in part:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> undersigned
counsel respectfully states that despite efforts exerted, he cannot contact the
petitioner anymore; that nevertheless under the circumstances the undersigned
feels that in view of the parole of the petitioner, it would now appear that
the issues involved in the present case have been rendered moot and
academic."</p>

<p class="BODY">We have noted, as above stated, that the petitioner was sentenced
to an indeterminate imprisonment of two (2) years and four (4) months, as
minimum, to six (6) years, as maximum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the certified true copy of the Receipt of Prisoner <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Sasi</span> in Criminal Case
No. 911 of the Municipal Court of San Joaquin, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
states that <span class="SpellE">Sasi</span> was given "an indeterminate
sentence of 4 months and 1 day to 3 years, 6 months and 20 days"
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 126.)</span> This is also the penalty stated in <span class="SpellE">Sasi's</span> Discharge on Parole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 127.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby dismissed for having
become moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
Municipal Judge of <st1:place>San Joaquin</st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>,
is hereby ordered to explain within ten (10) days from receipt the discrepancy
in respect of the penalty stated in the decision and that stated in the receipt
of prisoner.</p>
