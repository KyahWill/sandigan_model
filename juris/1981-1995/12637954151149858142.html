<p>Sometime in November 1969, Juan Bayang filed a complaint for quieting of 
title with damages against Benigno Biong in the Court of First Instance of 
Surigao del Norte, Branch I, docketed as Civil Case No. 1892.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In 1970, while the case was pending, Biong 
succeeded in dispossessing the plaintiff of the land in question and remained 
there until January 25, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> On 
February 21, 1972, the case was decided in favor of Biong, but the Court of 
Appeals on December 8, 1977, reversed the trial court, declaring in the 
dispositive portion of its decision:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is reversed and appellants 
are hereby declared owner of the property in litigation, and defendant-appellee 
are (<em>sic</em>) hereby ordered to pay appellant the sum of P56.40 as the 
latter's share in the proceeds from the sale of the copra derived from the third 
harvest of coconuts from the same land, and 1,000.00 as attorney's fees, and 
costs of litigation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>
<p>This decision became final on February 2, 1978.<br><br>On February 6, 1978, 
Bayang filed a second case, docketed as Civil Case No. 2589, with the CFI of 
Surigao del Norte, Branch II, seeking to recover from Biong the incomes earned 
from the same land from 1970 up to the quarterly incomes from 1978 until the 
said land was delivered to the plaintiff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> At the pre-trial conference held on July 
10, 1978, the counsel for Bayang admitted that as of January 25, 1978, Biong had 
already surrendered possession of the land in question to Bayang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [5]</sup> On August 16, 1978, Biong filed a motion 
for summary judgment, reiterating the affirmative defense of <em>res judicata 
</em>raised in his answer dated April 12, 1978, insofar as it related to the 
incidents concerning the case prior to January 25, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> An opposition to this motion was duly 
filed by Bayang.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The trial 
court, after considering the arguments of the parties, granted the motion and 
rendered a summary judgment on October 30, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The said decision was sustained by the 
Court of Appeals, and Bayang is now before us in this petition for review by 
<em>certiorari</em> under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<br><br>His assignment 
of errors raises two basic submissions, to wit: 
</p><ol><li>Civil Case No. 2589 should not have been decided by summary 
judgment.<br><br></li><li>The judgment in CA-G.R. No. 54720-R (appeal from judgment in Civil Case No. 
1892) did not constitute <em>res judicata</em> as to bar Civil Case No. 
2589.<br></li></ol>
<p>Both contentions are incorrect.&nbsp; We rule for the respondents.<br><br>In its 
decision, the Court of Appeals quoted the following excerpt from <em>Singleton 
v. Philippine Trust Co.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> on the 
nature and functions of the summary judgment:</p>
<blockquote>"Summary judgment is one of the methods sanctioned in the present 
Rules of Court for a prompt disposition of civil actions wherein there exists no 
serious controversy.&nbsp; The procedure may be availed of not only by claimants, but 
also by defending parties who may be the object of unfounded claims.&nbsp; A motion 
for summary judgment assumes that scrutinizing of the facts will disclose that 
the issues presented by the pleadings need not be tried because they are so 
patently unsubstantial as not to be genuine issues, or that there is no genuine 
issue as to any material facts or where the facts appear undisputed and certain 
from the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits." 
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>We hold that there was no genuine or triable issue of fact raised by the 
parties, in view particularly of the affirmative defense of <em>res 
judicata</em> invoked by the private respondent. That defense is 
sustained.<br><br>A long line of decisions has consistently held that for 
<em>res judicata</em> to apply:&nbsp; a) the former judgment must be final; b) it 
must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter 
and the parties; c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and d) there must be 
between the first case and the second case identity of parties, identity of 
subject matter and identity of cause of action.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The decision in Civil Case No. 
1892 became final and executory on February 2, 1978.&nbsp; There is no dispute that 
the trial court which rendered that decision had jurisdiction over the subject- 
matter and the parties to the proceeding.&nbsp; The case was tried on the merits.&nbsp; 
The parties to Civil Case No. 1892 and the subsequent Civil Case No. 2589 are 
the same petitioner and private respondent now before us.<br><br>The petitioner 
would draw a distinction between the land in dispute in Civil Case No. 1892 and 
the income from that land being claimed in Civil Case No. 2589.&nbsp; But that is in 
our view splitting hairs to split a cause of action.&nbsp; The subject-matter is 
essentially the same in both cases as the income is only a consequence or 
accessory of the disputed property.&nbsp; We cannot agree that there are involved 
here two causes of action calling for two separate cases.&nbsp; The claim for the 
income from the land was incidental to, and should have been raised by Bayang in 
his earlier claim for, ownership of the land.<br><br>We note that while the 
first case was pending, the private respondent, by the petitioner's own account, 
"succeeded in dispossessing" him of the disputed land<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and that at the pre-trial conference on 
Civil Case No. 2589, Bayang's counsel admitted that Biong had vacated the said 
property as of January 25, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> This 
means that from 1970 to the date the respondent surrendered the property in 
1978, Biong was presumably collecting and enjoying the income therefrom to the 
exclusion of the petitioner.<br><br>Civil Case No. 1892 was commenced in 
November 1969 and was finally decided only on February 2, 1978.&nbsp; The private 
respondent entered the disputed property in 1970 and left it only in 1978. For 
about seven years, therefore, the petitioner made no move at all to amend his 
complaint to include a claim for the income supposedly received by the private 
respondent during that period.<br><br>Under Rule 10, Section 6, of the Rules of 
Court: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sec. 6.&nbsp; Matters subject of supplemental pleadings.&nbsp; â€” Upon motion of a 
party the court may, upon reasonable notice and upon such terms as are just, 
permit him to serve a supplemental pleading setting forth transactions, 
occurrence or events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought 
to be supplemented.&nbsp; If the court deems it advisable that the adverse party 
should plead thereto, it shall so order, specifying the time therefor." 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of <em>Jalandoni v. Martin-Guanzon,</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> this Court declared through Justice 
J.B.L. Reyes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As to the value of the plaintiff's share in the products of the land during 
the time that the former action was pending (which are the damages claimed under 
the second cause of action), their recovery is now barred by the previous 
judgment.&nbsp; These damages are but the result of the original cause of action, 
<em>viz.</em>, the continuing refusal by defendants in 1941 to recognize the 
plaintiff's right to an interest in the property.&nbsp; In the same way that 
plaintiffs claimed for their share of the produce from 1941 to 1947, these later 
damages could have been claimed in the first action, either in the original 
complaint (for their existence could be anticipated when the first complaint was 
filed) or else by supplemental pleading.&nbsp; To allow them to be recovered by 
subsequent suit would be a violation of the rule against multiplicity of suits, 
and specifically of sections 3 and 4 of Rules 2 of the Rules of Court, against 
the splitting of causes of action, since these damages spring from the same 
cause of action that was pleading (<em>sic</em>) in the former case No. 573 
between the same parties (<em>Blossom &amp; Co., Inc. v. Manila Gas 
Corporation</em>, 55 Phil. 226; <em>Santos v. Moir</em>, 36 Phil. 350; 
<em>Pascua v. Sideco</em>; 24 Phil. 26; <em>Bachrach Motor Co. v. 
Icarangal,</em> 68 Phil. 287)." </p></blockquote>
<p>And in another case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the same 
jurist declared:</p>
<blockquote>"Urtula, as defendant in the expropriation case, could have raised 
the matter of interest before the trial court even if there had been no actual 
taking yet by the Republic and the said court could have included the payment of 
interest in its judgment but conditioned upon the actual taking, because the 
rate of interest upon the amount of just compensation (6%) is a known factor, 
and it can reasonably be expected that at some future time, the expropriator 
would take possession of the property, though the date be not fixed.&nbsp; In this 
way, multiple suits would be avoided.&nbsp; Moreover, nothing prevented appellee from 
calling the attention of the appellate courts (even by motion to reconsider 
before judgment became final) to the subsequent taking of possession by the 
condemnor, and asking for allowance of interest on the indemnity since that 
followed the taking as a matter of course, and raised no issue requiring remand 
of the records to the Court of origin.<br><br>"As the issue of interest could 
have been raised in the former case but was not raised, <em>res judicata</em> 
blocks the recovery of interest in the present case.&nbsp; (<em>Tejedor vs. Palet, 61 
Phil. 494; Phil Engineering Corp., et al. vs. Ceniza, etc., et al.</em>, 
L-17834, 29 Sept. 1962).&nbsp; It is settled that a former judgment constitutes a 
bar, as between the parties, not only as to matters expressly adjudged, but all 
matters that could have been adjudged at the time (Rule 39, sec. 49; <em>Corda 
vs. Maglinti</em>, L-17476, Nov. 30, 1961; <em>Rodriguez vs. Tan</em>, 48 Off. 
Gaz. 3330)." 
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, then, Civil Case No. 2589 is barred by the previous judgment in 
Civil Case No. 1892. This being so, it should follow that the trial judge 
committed no grave abuse of discretion in deciding the latter case by summary 
judgment.<br><br>We are not unmindful of the argument that affirmance of the 
challenged decision of the respondent court will result in the unjust enrichment 
of Biong at the expense of Bayang.&nbsp; This assumes, of course, that the petitioner 
could have proved his right to the income he now claims belatedly.&nbsp; The point is 
that he did not make the proper claim at the proper time and in the proper 
proceedings, and he cannot do it now.&nbsp; Whatever right he might have had is now 
deemed waived because of his neglect.<br><br><u><em>Nemo debet bis vexare pro 
una et eadem causa</em></u>.&nbsp; This has to be so if litigants are to be spared 
the annoyance, anxiety and expense that could otherwise be inflicted upon them 
endlessly by capricious, malicious or vindictive 
suitors.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is dismissed, and the 
appealed decision is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the petitioner. </p>
