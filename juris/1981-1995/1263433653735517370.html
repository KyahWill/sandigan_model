<p class="BODY">Specifically, on September 22, 1988, the accused Tom Chanas y
Pitan and a certain John Doe were charged in an Information which alleges -</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 2nd of August, 1988, at Km. 73, along
the Halsema National Highway, Amgaleyguey x x x Buguias x x x Benguet x x x the
above named accused conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding each other,
with intent of gain, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully, with the use
of firearms, apply force, violence and/or intimidation upon the persons of
MARINA BENOS y AWISAN, ALFONSO MALICDAN and EDWIN SAROL and, immediately
thereafter forcibly take, and carry away cash money amounting to TWENTY
THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000.00), Philippine Currency, original registration of a
vehicle and a driver's license, belonging to Marina Benos y Awisan, to her
damage and prejudice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That by reason of and on the occasion of the robbery, the
same accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually aiding each other, with
intent to kill, did then and there, wilfully and unlawfully shoot Alfonso
Malicdan on his jaw inflicting injuries on his person and likewise inflict
multiple gunshot wounds upon Edwin Sarol which caused the latter's death
immediately thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution is that on August 2, 1988, at
about midnoon, after having sold their vegetables at the public market of
Baguio City, the spouses Jaime and Marina Benos loaded their truck, an ELF
Mazda with Plate No. NJL-170, with groceries, fertilizers, cement and other dry
goods to be sold at Abatan, Bauko, Mt. Province.  Accompanied by their driver Edwin Sarol and neighbor Alfonso
Malicdan, Jaime Benos drove the truck after allowing his driver Edwin to rest
on top of their merchandise.  Marina sat
beside Jaime, while Alfonso stayed on the right of Marina.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Midway home, at Km. 50, they took dinner.  Before reaching Km. 73, Jaime, then feeling
sleepy and tired, transferred to the cargo side of the truck and asked Edwin to
take over the wheels.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At around 9:00 o'clock that evening, as they approached Km. 73,
Edwin stopped the truck as big stones blocked the highway.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Suddenly, two men appeared a few meters in front of the truck.  One of them was identified as appellant Tom
Chanas because the headlights of the truck were on.  Appellant Chanas then went to the left side with his face covered
with a handkerchief below his eyes and poked his gun at the head of Edwin
Sarol.  Chanas’ companion who was also
covering his face with a handkerchief, took to the right of the truck and
pointed his gun at Alfonso.  Both Chanas
and his companion simultaneously announced a holdup and demanded money from the
occupants of the truck.  When Alfonso
said that they had no more money as they spent it in the purchase of the goods
now loaded in their truck, the gunmen fired hitting driver Edwin on his right
eye and Alfonso on his jaw.  Horrified,
Marina immediately handed her bag containing P20,000.00 cash and personal
documents to Chanas.  After wresting the
bag, the holduppers fired again hitting Marina on her back before they fled on
foot.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When the highway robbers vanished from view, Jaime, who sought
cover at the back of the truck during the shooting, drove to the nearest
hospitals.  A few meters from the scene,
they passed by a parked International Loadstar freight truck with Plate No.
ABE-796 loaded with empty bottles of Coke.  Jaime stopped his vehicle but found no one inside the truck except cases
of empty bottles.  He then drove to Lutheran
Hospital in Buguias, Benguet.  Edwin was
pronounced dead on arrival, while Marina and Alfonso were treated for their
gunshot wounds.  Jaime then reported the
incident to the police at Buguias, Benguet.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Disavowing any knowledge of, much less participation in, the
fatal incident on the part of accused Tom Chanas, the defense through appellant
himself, together with Tirso Heron and Pedro Bestre, portrayed an ordinary and
innocuous night for Tom Chanas on August 2, 1988.  Appellant's story is that at around 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon
of that day, he and his helper Tirso Heron arrived at the Coca-Cola warehouse
at Abatan, Buguias, on board a truck driven by him and loaded with
softdrinks.  They came from Carlatan,
San Fernando, La Union.  After the unloading
which took about an hour, they piled cases of empty bottles into the
truck.  The manager of the warehouse
then invited them to a drinking party until 9:00 o'clock that evening.  Immediately after, appellant and his helper
left for Abatan, which is about a kilometer from the warehouse, where they took
dinner.  At about 9:30 that evening,
they left for Baguio City.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 9, 1988, while appellant was on a regular trip to
Abatan, the driver of an ELF truck flagged him down so he stopped and parked his
truck.  The driver asked him if he made
a trip on August 2, 1988, and he replied in the affirmative.  He gave his name and allowed his trip
tickets to be inspected by that driver.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 13, 1988, at about 11:30 in the morning, a policeman at
the Naguilian check point, Baguio City, stopped appellant.  After verifying his identity, appellant was
brought to the underground room of the "check point", while his three
companions were left outside.  A certain
Capt. Delson arrived with Jaime Benos.  While appellant was being questioned by Capt. Delson, Marina Benos and
Alfonso Malicdan arrived.  They were
asked whether it was appellant who attempted to kill them, but they remained
silent.  Later, however, after going out
of the room, the Benos spouses, Alfonso Malicdan and Capt. Delson returned and
said that appellant was the perpetrator of the fatal heist of August 2,1988.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro Bestre, a Municipal Councilor of Buguias, Benguet,
testified that on August 2, 1988, at about 9:20 in the evening, while on his
way home from church at Abatan, he passed by a restaurant some 350 to 400
meters away.  There he saw appellant
eating with a companion.  Bestre knew
appellant because the latter usually parked in front of the former's
house.  Bestre also testified that
travel time by vehicle from the scene of the incident at Km. 73 to Km. 85 at
Abatan, would take about an hour, and at that time the road was muddy because
of rain and the road widening.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i>a quo</i> sustained the version of the
prosecution and rendered judgment on October 30, 1989, finding appellant guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and sentenced him accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant Tom Chanas contends that the trial
court ERRED in (1) finding that he was positively identified; (2) rejecting his
defense of alibi and in not giving weight to the testimonies of his witnesses;
and, (3) giving credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses
despite inconsistencies and discrepancies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contentions of the defense are utterly without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first assigned error, Marina Benos categorically
and positively pointed to appellant as the person who, in the company of John
Doe, robbed her and fired successive shots at them resulting in physical
injuries to her and Alfonso Malicdan, and the death of Edwin Sarol.  While it may be true that the incident took
place at night, the headlights of the truck of the Benoses were however bright,
and appellant and his cohort were clearly visible as they approached the
victims.   Thus, Marina had a good chance
of looking particularly at the face of appellant Chanas.  On direct examination, she testified -</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Tom Chanas whom you mentioned, if you
see him again, will you be able to identify him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If he is in the courtroom can you point to
him? </blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Please point to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He is there sitting (witness pointing to a
person inside the courtroom who identified himself as Tom Chanas).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, when you heard the shots made by Tom Chanas,
what happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I just kept quiet and I said, ‘Kuarta,
adds ditoy' (The money is here).  And I
gave them my bag.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To whom did you give your bag?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To the person at my left side.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And you are referring to . . . ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tom Chanas."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross examination, Marina even made clearer her recollection
of the incident and her identification of appellant Chanas -</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Madam witness, are you saying that the
lights of the vehicle in front were on?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, the headlights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You were saying therefore that the two
persons came from the front of your vehicle, not from the side?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.  From the front.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How far were they from your vehicle the
first time you saw these two persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the block, about 10 to 20
meters.  They walked towards us.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can you tell us then how you were able to
recognize that the man with the handkerchief on his face one meter away from
you is (sic) Tom Chanas if his face, at least one-half of it was covered by a
handkerchief?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When they were approaching us, I looked at
his face.  As they were approaching us I
saw them already.  They did not have
their masks on yet.  As they were
nearing us, that was the time they put on their masks.”<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The positive identification of appellant Tom Chanas and his
companion as the perpetrators of the crime was consistently corroborated on all
material points by another prosecution witness, Alfonso Malicdan, who was
seated on the right of Marina during the robbery holdup.  Malicdan testified that Chanas and his conspirator
fired shots at them hitting him, Marina and Edwin.  Edwin died as a result.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus in full accord with the observations of the Solicitor
General -</p>

<blockquote>"For his part, accused-appellant Tom Chanas miserably failed to
cast doubt upon his being positively identified as one of the authors of the
crime charged.  True it is,
accused-appellant Tom Chanas raised questions on credibility of prosecution
witnesses, but nonetheless, he failed to discredit or impair the positive
testimonies made on him by Mrs. Marina Benos and Alfonso Malicdan.  For verily, their testimonies taken in their
entirety had not been shown to contain any material inconsistencies and
contradictions as to affect the reliability of their testimonies (People v. De
la Cruz, 148 SCRA, 582; People v. Narajos, 149 SCRA 99).  Equally noteworthy, no ulterior motives to
falsely testify against accused-appellant Tom Chanas were imputed to these
witnesses.  At bottom, the fact remains
that Mrs. Benos and Malicdan were both able to plainly recognize
accused-appellant as he was clearly focused and brightly illuminated by the
lights coming from the headlights as accused-appellant was approaching the
truck where Mrs. Benos and Malicdan were riding.  All these factors indubitably point to the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses' positive identification of accused-appellant as the
culprit (People v. Perez, 102 SCRA, 352; People v. Menzures, 113 SCRA
609)."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards his alibi, appellant Chanas maintains that at the time
of the incident he was in Abatan, Buguias, Benguet, which is about 12
kilometers from Km. 73 where the crime was committed.  But, it is well-settled that alibi cannot stand against the
positive identification of a credible witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Positive identification of the accused by the witnesses that he killed the
victim establishes the guilt of the accused to moral certainty.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In order to prosper, alibi must be convincing as to preclude any doubt that the
accused could not have been physically present at the place of the crime or its
vicinity at the time of the commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case before Us, We fully agree with the court <i>a quo</i> when it rejected
the defense of alibi, thus –</p>

<blockquote>"Even assuming that accused rested 1-1/2 hours after arriving
at 4:00 p.m. in Abatan warehouse and therefore started unloading the filled
bottles of Coke by 5:30 p.m., still, they, the accused and his companion, with
the help of the personnel in the warehouse, would have enough time to unload
their cargo, then load the empty bottles of Coke, eat supper, and proceed
thereafter with their truck to the place of the commission the crime.  This is (sic) not physically impossible
considering that Abatan, Buguias, Benguet, where the warehouse is located, is
only 12 kilometers away from Kilometer Post 73 where the crime was committed
and accused has (sic) almost 5 hours allowance from 4:00 p.m., when he arrived
in Abatan, to 9:00 p.m. when the crime was committed and a big truck to move
from one place to another."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second and third assigned errors deal principally with the
credibility of witnesses.  Appellant
faults the trial court for giving full credence to the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses.  But We find no
reason to distrust the holding of the court <i>a quo</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that when the main thrust of the appeal is
on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses, and appellant fails to
demonstrate why We should depart from the cardinal principle that findings of
fact of the trial court should not be disturbed, the same should be respected
on appeal due to the superior advantage of the lower court in observing the
conduct and demeanor of witnesses while testifying unless some fact or
circumstance which could affect the result of the case may have been
overlooked.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, We find no error in the conviction of appellant by the
trial court for Highway Robbery with Homicide under P.D. 532, otherwise known
as the "Anti-Piracy and Anti-Highway Robbery Law of 1974," the
pertinent provisions of which follow: </p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.  <b><i>Definition
of terms</i></b>. - The following terms shall mean and be understood as
follows:  x x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">c. <b><i>Philippine Highway</i></b>. - It shall refer to any road

in its minimum period shall be imposed.  If physical injuries or other crime are committed during or on the

shall be imposed</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the serious physical injuries inflicted on complaining
witnesses Marina Benos and Alfonso Malicdan, the court <i>a quo</i> is correct in
holding that said injuries are considered absorbed in the integrated crime of
Highway Robbery with Homicide in view of the imposition of <i>reclusion</i> <i>perpetua</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the civil aspect of the case, we advert to the policy
of the Court setting the indemnity for death of a person at P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
However, We sustain the award of P60,000.00 to the heirs of Edwin Sarol as We
find it reasonable under the attendant circumstances, aside from the fact that
the crime committed is a heinous one,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> and
the amount adjudged is not being disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the award of P20,000.00 to Marina Benos for actual
damages, We find the same sustained by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court further
awards to Marina Benos P20,000.00 "for her injuries" and to Alfonso
Malicdan P20,000.00 "as moral damages for his injuries".  While we perceive some inaccuracy in
designating these additional awards, and they are not even explained in the
decision appealed from, We nevertheless consider them appropriate under the
circumstances as moral damages for the physical sufferings of the offended
parties arising from the injuries sustained by them, conformably with Art.
