				<H3>COMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, PETITIONER, VS. HON. COURT OF TAX APPEALS, SMITH BELL & CO., INC., IN ITS CAPACITY AS AGENT OF SS "NORMAN", RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GANCAYCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><p align="justify">The Commissioner of Customs, the herein petitioner, elevated 
this case on certiorari to this Court for a review of the decision of the 
respondent Court of Tax Appeals reversing the decision of the petitioner, 
holding that petitioner misapplied certain sections of the Tariff and Customs 
Code.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Earlier, petitioner affirmed the 
judgment rendered by his subordinate, the Collector of Customs of 
Manila.<br><br>The legal provisions involved in this case are Sections 1005, 
2521, and 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code.&nbsp; Section 1005 lays down the 
indispensable requirement that every vessel coming from a foreign part must have 
on board a complete manifest of all her cargo, further stating therein the 
required contents of each manifest intended to be submitted to the customs 
authorities.&nbsp; It reads:</p>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 1005.&nbsp; Manifest Required of Vessel From Foreign Port.&nbsp; — 
Every vessel from a foreign port must have on board a complete manifest of all 
her cargo. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">All of the cargo intended to be landed at a port in the 
Philippines must be described in separate manifests for each port of call 
therein.&nbsp; Each manifest shall include the port of departure and the port of 
delivery with the marks, numbers, quantity and des­cription of the packages and 
the names of the consignees thereof.&nbsp; Every vessel from a foreign port must have 
on board complete manifests of passengers and their baggage, in the pres­cribed 
form, setting forth their destination and all particulars required by the 
immigration laws; and every such vessel shall have prepared for presentation to 
the proper customs official upon arrival in ports of the Philippines a complete 
list of all sea stores then on board.&nbsp; If the vessel does not carry cargo or 
passengers the manifest must show that no cargo or passenger, as the case may 
be, is carried from the port of departure to the port of destination in the 
Philippines.<br><br>A cargo manifest shall in no case be changed or altered 
after entry of the vessel, except by means of an amendment by the master, 
consignee or agent thereof, under oath, and attached to the original manifest:&nbsp; 
Provided, however, That after the invoice and/or entry covering an importation 
have been received and recorded in the office of the appraiser, no amendment of 
the manifest shall be allowed, except when it is obvious that a clerical error 
or any other discrepancy has been committed in the preparation of the manifest, 
without any fraudulent intent, discovery of which could not have been made until 
after examination of the importation has been completed."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Both Secs. 2521 and 2523 provide for the corresponding 
penalties in case Sec. 1005 is violated.<br><br>The facts of the case are 
substantially related in the decision of the respondent Court of Tax Appeals as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It appears that on July 20, 1966, the vessel SS "NORMAN", with 
Customs Registry No. 10 85, arrived at the port of Manila carrying, among 
others, a shipment of 1,400 Multiwall Paper Bags.&nbsp; The vessel's cargo manifest 
shows that the gross weight of said articles was 3,620 kilos, but based on the 
bill of lading and customs appraisal, the actual and correct weight thereof was 
36,197 kilos.&nbsp; Consequently, to correct the weight declared in the manifest, 
petitioner, in its capacity as ship agent, filed an amendment on July 27, 1966, 
which amendment was ap­proved by the Bureau of Customs without prejudice to any 
administra­tive action which might be taken against the vessel.<br><br>In 1969, 
the SS "NORMAN", represented by herein petitioner, was charged for violation of 
Section 1005, in relation to Section 2523, of the Tariff and Customs Code.&nbsp; 
However, on March 16, 1971, counsel for the Bureau of Customs sought the 
amendment of the charge to one for violation of Section 1005, in relation to 
Section 2521 of the Code.<br><br>On June 11, 1971, after hearing, the Collector 
of Customs rendered a decision imposing upon the vessel and/or petitioner herein 
a fine of P7,000.00 for violation of Section 1005, in relation to Section 2521, 
of the Tariff and Customs Code.<br><br>On November 20, 1972, said decision of 
the Collector was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs." x x 
x</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The main issue posed for this Court's consideration is — in 
case the weight of a cargo is inaccurately or incorrectly stated in the 
manifest, which provision of the Tariff and Customs Code should be applied to 
the situation, Section 2521 or Section 2523?<br><br>Sections 2521 and 2523 
provide — </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2521 - Failure to Supply Requisite Manifests, — If any 
vessel or aircraft enters or departs from a port of entry without submitting the 
proper manifests to the customs authorities, or shall enter or depart conveying 
unmanifested cargo other than as stated in the next preceding section hereof, 
such vessel or aircraft shall be fined an amount not less than ten thousand 
pesos (P10,000.00) but not exceeding thirty thousand (P30,000.00) 
pesos.<br><br>The same fine shall be imposed upon any arriving or departing 
vessel or aircraft if the master or pilot in command shall fail to deliver or 
mail to the Commission on Audit a true copy of the manifest of the incoming or 
outgoing cargo, as required by law.&nbsp; (As amended by P.D. No. 1258-A)" 
</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"SEC. 2523.&nbsp; Discrepancy Between Actual and Declared Weight of 
Manifested Article. — If the gross weight of any article or package described in 
the manifest exceeds by more than twenty <em>per centum</em> the gross weight as 
declared in the manifest or bill of lading thereof, and the Collector shall be 
of opinion that such dis­crepancy was due to the carelessness or incompetency of 
the master or pilot in command, owner or employee of the vessel or aircraft, a 
fine of not more than fifteen <em>per centum</em> of the value of the package or 
article in respect to which the deficiency exists, may be imposed upon the 
importing vessel or aircraft."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Petitioner opines that Sec. 1005 imposes upon every vessel the 
absolute obligation to have on board a complete manifest of her cargo.&nbsp; A 
failure to comply with said requirement is penalized with a fine under Sec. 2521 
since the latter provision requires that any vessel entering or departing from a 
port of entry must submit the <em>proper </em>manifest to the customs 
authorities.&nbsp; In other words, as in this case, when the weight of the cargo in 
question was incorrectly stated in the manifest, petitioner contends Sec. 2521 
is applicable because a manifest wherein the weight is not accurately indicated 
is not a “proper” manifest.<br><br>We disagree.<br><br>If the weight of the 
cargo is in issue, the provision of the Tariff and Customs Code properly 
applicable is Sec. 2523, not Sec. 2521.&nbsp; A special and specific provision 
prevails over a general provision irrespective of their relative position in the 
statute.&nbsp; <em>Generalia specialibus non derogant</em>.&nbsp; Where there is in the 
same statute a particular enactment and also a general one which in its most 
comprehensive sense would include what is embraced in the former, the particular 
enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect 
only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of 
the particular enactment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> It is a 
principle in statutory construction that where two statutes are of equal 
theoretical application to a particular case, the one specially designed for 
said case must prevail over the other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Clearly, Sec. 2523 is directly 
applicable to the case at bar since said provision specifically applies to the 
situation where there is a discrepancy between the actual gross weight of any 
article or package described in the manifest and the gross weight as declared in 
the manifest or bill of lading.<br><br>Public respondent Court of Tax Appeals in 
interpreting the scope of the provision of Section 2521 of the Tariff and 
Customs Code in this particular case made the following disquisition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In this case, there is neither a failure or an omission to 
submit the requisite manifest nor an omission to include any cargo in the 
manifest.&nbsp; <em>The article or cargo itself and its particulars, including the 
weight, are listed and described in the manifest, but the weight declared in the 
manifest is much less than the correct weight declared in the bill of 
lading.</em>&nbsp; Clearly, contrary to the opinion of respondent, Section 2521 of 
the Tariff and Customs Code has no application to the case at bar." 
(Underscoring Supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">We agree.<br><br>The said section penalizes the failure to file 
a proper manifest or when the cargo is unmanifested.&nbsp; In this case a manifest 
has been filed declaring the weight of the cargo.&nbsp; Although it appears to be 
undeclared, this cannot constitute a violation of said Section 2521 of the 
Tariff and Customs Code since for all legal purposes a proper manifest had been 
filed covering the cargo.&nbsp; The <em>proper manifest</em> as provided in Section 
2521 should be interpreted to mean a <em>complete manifest </em>as provided for 
in Section 1005 aforecited the pertinent portion of which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Each manifest shall include the port of departure and the port 
of delivery with the<em> marks, numbers, quantity and description of the 
packages </em>and the names of consignors thereof." (Underscoring 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The law does not even require the weight of the cargo to be 
specified.&nbsp; Thus, the inclusion of the weight of the cargo in the manifest in a 
lesser amount than its actual gross weight does not thereby render the manifest 
incomplete.&nbsp; There is no breach of Section 2521 aforesaid under these 
circumstances.<br><br>The failure to declare the correct weight in the manifest 
may however be penalized under Section 2523 which precisely contemplates such a 
situation.<br><br>To suggest as petitioner contends, that liability can be 
incurred under both Sections 2521 and 2523 aforestated in the instant case would 
render nugatory the principle against double jeopardy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At this juncture, the question is — 
can the private respondent be held responsible under Section 2523?<br><br>This 
must be answered in the negative.<br><br>In order to be liable under Section 
2523, two requisites must be satisfied, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1)&nbsp; the actual gross weight of any article or package described 
in the manifest exceeds by more than twenty <em>per centum</em> the gross weight 
as declared in the manifest or bill of lading thereof, and<br><br>2) the 
Collector shall be of opinion that such discrepancy was due to the careless­ness 
or incompetency of the master or pilot in command, owner or employee of the 
vessel or aircraft.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">While the first requirement is present, the second requirement 
is not.&nbsp; No evidence to that effect may be found in the records.&nbsp; The respondent 
court itself, in its decision, found that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"It appears that the cargo in question was declared in the 
manifest as weighing 3,620 kilos although the actual weight was 36,197 kilos.&nbsp; 
There is, however, no evidence that the under declaration in the weight of said 
cargo was due to the carelessness or negligence of the master, pilot, owner or 
employee of the vessel.&nbsp; In fact, the bill of lading covering the cargo in 
question reflects the correct weight x x x."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Indeed as above related<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, private respondent filed an amendment to 
the manifest to correct the weight declared on July 27, 1966 which amendment was 
approved the Bureau of Customs.&nbsp; It demonstrates the diligence and good faith of 
private respondent.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the Court 
of Tax Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED.&nbsp; No costs. </p>
