				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a petition for <i>cetiorari</i> questioning the legality
of the dismissal from employment of petitioners for allegedly mauling a fellow
employee within the private respondent company's premises in violation of a
company rule.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners Alfredo L. Oania, a welder, and Aurelio B. Caluza and
Santiago B. Biay, miners, were employed by respondent Philex Mining Corporation
in Pacdal, Tuba, Benguet.  They were
accused of mauling their co-worker, Felipe P. Malong, at the gasoline area
within the company compound at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of May 21,
1986.  Malong's injuries almost proved
fatal were it not for the immediate medical attendance given him, both at the
company clinic and at the Dr. Efraim Montemayor Medical Center in Baguio City.</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent conducted an investigation regarding the
incident.  On September 20, 1986, it
placed petitioners under preventive suspension.  After a formal hearing wherein petitioners were duly notified and
accorded the opportunity to be heard, the company arrived at the decision to
terminate their employment on the ground that petitioners violated Article I,
paragraph 1 of the company rules and regulations which states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily injury on the
job-site on company time or property for any reason, or attempting to inflict
or inflicting bodily injury anywhere at anytime, in any dispute involving one's
employment.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>On October 11, 1986, copies of the
decision were served upon petitioners but they refused to receive them.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thereupon, Malong instituted a criminal complaint against
petitioners before the provincial fiscal of Benguet.  In due <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>time, </span>petitioners
were charged with frustrated homicide before the Regional Trial Court of Baguio
City in Criminal Case No. 3681-R but later, Malong desisted from pursuing the
criminal case.</p>

<p class=BODY>Armed with Malong's affidavit of desistance, petitioners sought
reconsideration of their dismissal from employment, alleging that when the
incident occurred, they were asleep.  Because private respondent refused to take them back, petitioners filed
separate complaints for illegal dismissal before the labor arbiter in Baguio
City.  Their complaints were thereafter
consolidated.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>On August 31, 1988, Labor Arbiter Amado T. Adquilen rendered a
decision holding that petitioners had been illegally dismissed from employment
and directing private respondent to reinstate them to their former positions or
substantially equivalent positions and to pay each of them one year's
backwages.  The Labor Arbiter's
conclusion that the termination of employment of petitioners was not justified
was based on his finding that there was no proof that the mauling of Malong was
&quot;caused by a dispute involving their employment&quot; with private
respondent which, the Labor Arbiter believed, was the only dispute clearly
prohibited by the company rule.  He
considered as mitigating the circumstances that petitioners were &quot;either
on leave, enjoying his rest day, or simply off-duty.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondent appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC).  On October 31, 1989,
the NLRC rendered a decision<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
finding that &quot;there is prima facie evidence that the complainants injured
physically a co-employee under circumstance(s) which constitute an infraction
of specific company rules; and that the respondent had valid cause to terminate
their employment.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>The NLRC thus dismissed the cases for
lack of merit, thereby reversing the decision appealed from.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision
but on November 27, 1990, the NLRC issued a resolution<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
denying the said motion for lack of merit.  The NLRC ruled that since several witnesses saw the petitioners inflict
serious physical injuries upon Malong, their misconduct was &quot;serious
enough to warrant dismissal.&quot; It stressed that its interpretation of the
company rules and regulation was correct and &quot;to follow the argument of
complainants will result in absurdity and will render such rules
nugatory.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, the instant petition charging the public respondent with
grave abuse of discretion in interpreting the company rule too harshly,
unconscionably and contrary to the spirit of the Labor Code and the
Constitution, and in holding that the dismissal of petitioners was for a just
cause.</p>

<p class=BODY>A preliminary matter in the resolution of this case is the
interpretation of Art. I, paragraph 1 of the company rules and regulations
aforequoted which, petitioners admit, is a product of a collective bargaining
agreement.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The Labor Arbiter is convinced that the acts prohibited therein, i.e.,
inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily injury, should be applied only in
instances where there have been &quot;disputes involving their
employment.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the NLRC held that the same company rule applies even if the
mauling was not caused by &quot;disputes involving their employment&quot;
because it was committed within company premises.</p>

<p class=BODY>There is apparent conflict between the interpretation of the
Labor Arbiter and the NLRC of the provision of the collective bargaining
agreement in question.</p>

<p class=BODY>A close study of the provision involved reveals, however, the
absurdity of the Labor Arbiter's interpretation that the concluding phrase
&quot;any dispute involving one's employment&quot; is a continuation of the
phrase &quot;for any reason&quot; in the first clause of the sentence.  Such interpretation explains his position
that <u>all</u> physical injuries inflicted by a worker must be the result of a
&quot;dispute involving one's employment.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The provision in question obviously covers situations where any
company employee inflicts or attempts to inflict physical harm or injury upon
any person.  There are two separate
instances contemplated here.  The first
part of the sentence conceives of a situation wherein such injury was done
&quot;on the job site on company time or property,&quot; regardless of the
reason.  What is material is the
venue.  The second half of the sentence
deals with a situation where an employee attempts to inflict or actually
inflicts bodily injury upon another &quot;anywhere at anytime,&quot; regardless
of the venue, as long as it arose in connection with a dispute &quot;involving
one's employment.&quot; The site matters not; what is crucial is the subject
matter, i.e. it should have something to do with the employee's job.  Clearly, the commas in the sentence may be
dispensed with without sacrificing the intent behind the provision.</p>

<p class=BODY>Considering the foregoing, may the petitioners be deemed legally
dismissed for violation of the company rule against infliction of bodily harm?</p>

<p class=BODY>The issue may only be resolved upon an examination of the facts
supporting the dismissal of petitioners from employment.  In this regard, the NLRC's findings are
binding upon this Court if supported by substantial evidence.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, the findings of facts of the Labor Arbiter are accorded
great respect,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9' href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
particularly if the NLRC simply makes a general statement of the dismissed
employee's &quot;guilt&quot;, as in this case.</p>

<p class=BODY>Unfortunately, both the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC did not make
definitive findings on whether or not the incident in question was in fact
authored by petitioners.  However, we
proceed on the assumption that the incident did transpire, for petitioners
could not have been dismissed from employment after due investigation if it
were not so.  On the issue of the
legality of the dismissal, two requisites must concur to constitute a valid
dismissal:  (a) the dismissal must be
for any of the causes expressed in Art. 282 of the Labor Code, and (2) the
employee must be accorded due process, basic of which are the opportunity to be
heard and to defend himself.</p>

<p class=BODY>As regards the first requisite, Art. 282 of the Labor <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>”</span>ART. 282.  Termination by employer. - An employer may
terminate an employment for any of the following causes:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span><u>Serious</u> <u>misconduct</u> or willful
disobedience by the employee of the lawful orders of his employer or
representative in connection with his work;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>(b)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>Gross
and habitual neglect by the employee of his duties;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>Fraud or willful breach by the employee of the
trust reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>Commission of a crime or offense by the
employee against the person of his employer or any immediate member of his
family or his duly authorized representative; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>(e)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>    </span>Other
causes analogous to the foregoing.&quot; (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Violation of a company rule prohibiting the infliction of harm or
physical injury against any person under the particular circumstances provided
for in the same rule may be deemed analogous to &quot;serious misconduct&quot;
stated in Art. 282 (a) above.  To
repeat, however, there is no substantial evidence definitely pointing to
petitioners as the perpetrators of the mauling of Malong.  What is an established fact is that, after
investigation, private respondent dismissed them and, thereafter, a criminal
complaint was filed against petitioners.  Likewise, it is of record that Malong desisted from suing the
perpetrators before the regular courts.  Therein, Malong stated that he was bothered by his conscience in
implicating Santiago Biay, Ver Oania and Aurelio Calusa as the persons who
mauled him, the truth being that they were not the real perpetrators of the
said mauling but other persons whom he could not identify.  In criminal cases, an affidavit of desistance
may create serious doubts as to the liability of the accused.  At the very least, such affidavit calls for
a second hard look at the records of the case and the basis for the judgment of
conviction.  Thus, jurisprudence on the
effect of desistance notwithstanding, the affidavit should not be peremptorily
dismissed as a useless scrap of paper.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10'
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>In labor cases where technical rules of procedure are not to be
strictly applied if the result would be detrimental to the working man,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
an affidavit of desistance gains added importance in the absence of any
evidence on record explicitly showing that the dismissed employees committed
the act which caused their dismissal.  The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that petitioners' mauling of
Malong was not proved by substantial evidence and is, therefore, open to
question.</p>

<p class=BODY>In <u>Foodmine,</u> <u>Incorporated</u> <u>(Kentucky</u> <u>Fried</u>
<u>Chicken)</u> <u>v.</u> <u>NLRC</u><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12'
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which similarly involves fighting between employees, the Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;There is no dispute that fighting on company premises may be
considered as a valid ground for dismissal of an employee but in the case at
bar, the facts do not warrant the application of the same.  Firstly, because petitioner has miserably
failed to substantiate its allegations of serious misconduct.  Secondly, granting that the allegations of
the petitioner are true, the penalty of dismissal is not commensurate with the
misconduct allegedly committed.  Private
respondent had been a regular employee of petitioner for six (6) years and
apparently, the alleged incident is his first.  x x x.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The same considerations may be extended to this case where the
petitioners do not appear to have a previous record of the same or any
misconduct.  They, too, have served the
private respondent for a considerable length of time, thus:  Biay, 16 years; Oania, 15 years and Caluya,
7 years.</p>

<p class=BODY>As regards the second requisite for dismissal, i.e., that the
employee must be given the opportunity to be heard and to defend himself,
petitioners' allegation that they were not furnished by private respondent with
a copy of its decision to terminate them, in violation of Sec. 4, Rule XIV of
the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Batas Pambansa Blg. No. 130 is not
supported by the records.  After private
respondent initiated an investigation on the mauling incident and petitioners
were suspended thereafter, the matter was referred to the grievance machinery
outlined in the collective bargaining agreement.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13'
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Having notified the petitioners and given them an opportunity to be heard and
to defend themselves, the company arrived at its decision to terminate their
employment.  On October 11, 1986, copies
of the decision were served upon them but they refused to receive the same.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>While there is no proof
that private respondent was moved by ill motive or bad faith in dismissing the
petitioners, equity and the spirit of the Labor Code dictate that the
petitioners be reinstated to their respective former positions without loss of
seniority rights and paid their backwages.  Considering, however, that Republic Act No. 6715 entitling unjustly
dismissed employees </span>to &quot;his full backwages inclusive of allowances,
and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time
his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual
reinstatement&quot; which took effect on March 21, 1989, has no retroactive
