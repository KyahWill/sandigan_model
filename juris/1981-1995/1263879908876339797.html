				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking the reversal
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>of </span>the March 23, 1990 decision
of the Court of Appeals which ruled that the petitioner's purchase of a farm
tractor was not validly consummated and ordered a complaint for its recovery
dismissed.</p>

<p class=BODY>The facts <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>as </span>established by the records are as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>The petitioner, Perfecto <span class=SpellE>Dy</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span> are brothers.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometime in 1979, <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dy</span> purchased a truck and a farm tractor through
financing extended by Libra Finance and Investment Corporation (Libra).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both truck and tractor were mortgaged to Libra
as security for the loan.</p>

<p class=BODY>The petitioner wanted to buy the tractor from his brother so on
August 20, 1979, he wrote a letter to Libra requesting that he be allowed to
purchase from <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span>
the said tractor and assume the mortgage debt of the latter.</p>

<p class=BODY>In a letter dated August 27, 1979, Libra thru its manager, <span
class=SpellE>Cipriano</span> Ares approved the petitioner's request.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, on September 4, 1979, <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dy</span> executed a deed of absolute sale in favor of the
petitioner over the tractor in question.</p>

<p class=BODY>At this time, the subject tractor was in the possession of Libra
Finance due to <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy's</span>
failure to pay the amortizations.</p>

<p class=BODY>Despite the offer of full payment by the petitioner to Libra for
the tractor, the immediate release could not be <span class=GramE>effected</span>
because <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span> had
obtained financing not only for said tractor but also for a truck and Libra
insisted on full payment for both.</p>

<p class=BODY>The petitioner was able to convince his sister, Carol <span
class=SpellE>Dy</span>-Seno, to purchase the truck so that full payment could
be made for both.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On November 22, 1979,
a <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>PNB check was issued in the amount of
P22<span class=GramE>,000.00</span> in favor of Libra, thus settling in full
the indebtedness of <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span>
with the financing firm.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Payment having
been effected through an out-of-town check, Libra insisted that it be cleared
first before Libra could release the chattels in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>Meanwhile, Civil Case No.</span> R-16646
entitled &quot;<span class=SpellE>Gelac</span> Trading, Inc. v. <span
class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span>&quot;, a collection
case to recover the sum of P12<span class=GramE>,269.80</span> was pending in
another court in <span class=SpellE>Cebu</span>.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>On </span>the strength of
an alias writ of execution issued on December 27, 1979, the provincial sheriff
was able to seize and levy on the tractor which was in the premises of Libra in
Carmen, <span class=SpellE>Cebu</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The tractor was subsequently sold at public auction where <span
class=SpellE>Gelac</span> Trading was the lone bidder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Later, <span class=SpellE>Gelac</span> sold
the tractor to <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>one
</span>of its stockholders, Antonio Gonzales.</p>

<p class=BODY>It was only when the check was cleared on January 17, 1980 that
the petitioner learned about GELAC having already taken custody of the subject
tractor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Consequently, the petitioner
filed an action to recover the subject tractor against GELAC Trading with the
Regional Trial Court of <span class=SpellE>Cebu</span> City.</p>

<p class=BODY>On April 8, 1988, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of the
petitioner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The <span class=SpellE><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>dispositive</span></span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> </span>portion of the decision reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff and against the defendant, pronouncing that the plaintiff is the
owner of the tractor, subject matter of this case, and directing the defendants
<span class=SpellE>Gelac</span> Trading Corporation and Antonio Gonzales to
return the same to the plaintiff herein; directing the defendants jointly and
severally to pay to the plaintiff the amount <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>of P1,541.00 </span>as expenses for hiring a tractor; P50,000 for moral
damages; P50,000 for <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>exemplary damages;
and to pay the cost.&quot; (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 35-36)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the RTC
and dismissed the complaint with costs against the petitioner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Court of Appeals held that the tractor in
question still belonged to <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dy</span> <span class=GramE>When</span> it was seized and levied
by the sheriff by virtue of the alias writ of execution issued in Civil Case
No. <span class=GramE>R-16646.</span></p>

<p class=BODY>The petitioner now comes to the Court raising the following
questions:</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>A.<span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS MIS-APPREHENDED
THE FACTS AND ERRED IN NOT AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURT'S FINDING THAT OWNERSHIP
OF THE FARM TRACTOR HAD ALREADY PASSED TO HEREIN PETITIONER WHEN <span
class=GramE>SAID TRACTOR</span> WAS LEVIED ON BY THE SHERIFF PURSUANT TO AN
ALIAS WRIT OF EXECUTION ISSUED IN ANOTHER CASE IN FAVOR OF RESPONDENT GELAC
TRADING INC.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;WHETHER OR NOT THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS EMBARKED ON
MERE CONJECTURE AND SURMISE IN HOLDING THAT THE SALE OF THE AFORESAID TRACTOR
TO PETITIONER WAS DONE IN FRAUD OF WILFREDO DY'S CREDITORS, THERE BEING NO
EVIDENCE OF SUCH FRAUD AS FOUND BY THE TRIAL COURT,&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>C.<span style='font-weight:normal'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

MIS-APPREHENDED THE FACTS AND ERRED IN NOT SUSTAINING THE FINDING OF THE TRIAL
COURT THAT THE SALE OF THE TRACTOR BY RESPONDENT GELAC TRADING TO ITS
CO-RESPONDENT ANTONIO V. GONZALES ON AUGUST 2, 1980 - AT WHICH TIME BOTH
RESPONDENTS ALREADY KNEW OF THE FILING OF THE INSTANT CASE - WAS VIOLATIVE OF
THE HUMAN RELATIONS PROVISIONS OF THE CIVIL CODE AND RENDERED THEM LIABLE FOR
THE MORAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES SLAPPED AGAINST THEM BY THE TRIAL COURT.&quot;
(<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 13)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The respondents claim that at the time of the execution of the
deed of sale, no constructive delivery was <span class=GramE>effected</span>
since the consummation of the sale depended upon the clearance and encashment
of the check which was issued in payment of the subject tractor.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the case of <span class=SpellE><u>S<span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

style='mso-tab-count:2'>                </span>xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:
2'>                   </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The rule is settled that the chattel mortgagor continues to be
the owner of the property, and therefore, has the power to alienate the same;
however, he is obliged under pain of penal liability, to secure the written
consent of the mortgagee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>(Francisco, Vicente, Jr., Revised Rules of Court in the
Philippines, (1972), Volume IV-B Part I, p. 525).</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus, the instruments of mortgage are
binding, while they subsist, not only upon the parties executing them but also
upon those who later, by purchase or otherwise, acquire the properties referred
to therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The absence of the written consent of the mortgagee to the
sale of the mortgaged property in favor of a third person, therefore, affects
not the validity of the sale but only the penal liability of the mortgagor
under the Revised Penal Code and the binding effect of such sale on the
mortgagee<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'> under the Deed of Chattel
Mortgage.&quot;</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class=GramE>xxx</span><span
style='mso-tab-count:2'>                </span>xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:
2'>                   </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The mortgagor who gave the property as security under a chattel
mortgage did not part with <span class=GramE>he</span> ownership over the
same.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had the right to sell it
although he was under the obligation to secure the written <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>consent </span>of
the mortgagee or he lays himself open to criminal prosecution under the
provision of Article 319 par. 2 of the Revised Penal Code.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>even </span>if no <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt'>consent </span>was obtained from the mortgagee, the validity of the sale
would still not be affected.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic'>we </span>see no reason why <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dy</span>, as the chattel mortgagor can not sell the subject
tractor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no dispute that the
consent of Libra Finance was obtained in the instant case.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a letter dated August 27, 1979, Libra allowed
the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>petitioner </span>to purchase the
tractor and assume the mortgage debt of his brother.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sale between the brothers was therefore
valid and binding as between them and to the mortgagee, as well.</p>

<p class=BODY>Article 1496 of the Civil Code states that the ownership of the
thing sold is acquired by the vendee from the moment it is delivered to him in
any of the ways specified in Articles 1497 to 1501 or in any other manner
signifying an agreement that the possession is transferred from the vendor to
the vendee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We agree with the petitioner
that Articles 1498 and 1499 are applicable in the case at bar.</p>

<p class=BODY>Article 1498 states:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Art. 1498<span class=GramE>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When</span> the sale is made through a public instrument, the execution
thereof shall be equivalent to the delivery of the thing which is the object of
the contract, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>if
from the deed the contrary does not appear or cannot clearly be inferred.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class=GramE>xxx</span><span
style='mso-tab-count:2'>                </span>xxx<span style='mso-tab-count:
2'>                   </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Article 1499 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class=GramE>&quot;Article 1499.</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The delivery of movable property may likewise
be made by the mere consent or agreement of the contracting parties, if the
thing sold cannot be transferred to the possession of the vendee at the time of
the sale, or if the latter already had it in his possession for any other
reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1463a)&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In the instant case, actual delivery of the subject tractor could
not be made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, there was
constructive delivery already upon the execution of the public instrument
pursuant to Article 1498 and upon the consent or agreement of the parties when
the thing sold cannot be immediately transferred to the possession of the
vendee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Art. 1499)</p>

<p class=BODY>The respondent court avers that the vendor must first have
control and possession of the thing before he could transfer ownership by
constructive delivery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here, it was
Libra Finance which was in possession of the subject tractor due to <span
class=SpellE>Wilfredo's</span> failure to pay the amortization as a preliminary
step to foreclosure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As mortgagee, he
has the right of foreclosure upon default by the mortgagor in the performance
of the conditions mentioned in the contract of mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law implies that the mortgagee is
entitled to possess the mortgaged property because possession is necessary in
order to enable him to have the property sold.</p>

<p class=BODY>While it is true that <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span
class=SpellE>Dy</span> was not in actual possession and control of the subject
tractor, his right of ownership was not divested from him upon his
default.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither could it be said that
Libra was the owner of the subject tractor because the mortgagee can not become
the owner of or convert and appropriate to <span class=GramE>himself</span> the
property mortgaged.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Article 2088, Civil
Code) Said property continues to belong to the mortgagor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only remedy given to the mortgagee is to
have said property sold at public auction and the proceeds of the sale applied
to the payment of the obligation secured by the mortgagee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(See Martinez v. PNB, 93 Phil. 765, 767
[1953]) There is no showing that Libra Finance has already foreclosed the
mortgage and that it was the new owner of the subject tractor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Undeniably, Libra <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>gave </span>its consent to the sale of the subject
tractor to the petitioner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was aware
of the transfer of rights to the petitioner.</p>

<p class=BODY>Where a third person purchases the mortgaged property, he
automatically steps into the shoes of the original mortgagor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>(See Industrial Finance
Corp. v. <span class=SpellE>Apostol</span>, 177 SCRA 521 [1989]).</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>His right of ownership shall be subject to
the mortgage of the thing sold to him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In the case at bar, the petitioner was fully aware of the existing
mortgage of the subject tractor to Libra.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In fact, when he was obtaining Libra's consent to the sale, he
volunteered to assume the remaining balance of the mortgage debt of <span
class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> <span class=SpellE>Dy</span> which Libra
undeniably agreed to.</p>

<p class=BODY>The payment of the check was actually intended to extinguish the
mortgage obligation so that the tractor could be released to the
petitioner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was never intended nor
could it be considered as payment of the purchase price because the
relationship between Libra and the petitioner is not one of sale but still a
mortgage.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The clearing or encashment of
the check which produced the effect of payment determined the full payment of
the money obligation and the release of the chattel mortgage.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not determinative of the consummation
of the sale.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The transaction between the
brothers is distinct and <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>apart </span>from
the transaction between Libra and the petitioner.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The contention, therefore, that the
consummation of the sale depended upon the encashment of the check is
untenable.</p>

<p class=BODY>The sale of the subject tractor was consummated upon the
execution of the public instrument on September 4, 1979.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this time constructive delivery was
already <span class=GramE>effected</span>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Hence, the subject tractor was no longer owned by <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dy</span> when it was levied upon by the sheriff in
December, 1979.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well settled is the rule
that only properties unquestionably owned by the judgment debtor and which are
not exempt by law from execution should be levied upon or sought to be levied
upon.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the power of the court <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:29.0pt'>in </span>the execution of its judgment
extends only over properties belonging to the judgment debtor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Consolidated Bank and Trust Corp. v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 78771, January 23, 1991).</p>

<p class=BODY>The respondents further claim that at that time the sheriff
levied on the tractor and took legal custody thereof no one ever protested or
filed a third party claim.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is inconsequential whether a third party claim has been filed
or not by the petitioner during the time the sheriff levied on the subject
tractor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A person other than the
judgment debtor who claims ownership or right over levied properties is not
precluded, however, from taking other legal remedies to prosecute his
claim.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(Consolidated Bank and Trust
Corp. v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>) This is precisely what the petitioner
did when he filed the action for <span class=SpellE>replevin</span> with the
RTC.</p>

<p class=BODY>Anent the second and third issues <span class=GramE>raised,</span>
the Court accords great respect and weight to the findings of fact of the trial
court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no sufficient evidence
to show that the sale of the tractor was in fraud of <span class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span>
and creditors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While it is true that <span
class=SpellE>Wilfredo</span> and Perfecto are brothers, this fact alone does
not give rise to the presumption that the sale was fraudulent.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Relationship is not a badge of fraud (<span
class=SpellE>Goquiolay</span> v. <span class=SpellE>Sycip</span>, 9 SCRA 663
[1963]).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Moreover, fraud can not be
presumed; it must be established by clear convincing evidence.</p>

<p class=BODY>We agree with the trial court's findings that the actuations of
GELAC Trading were indeed <span class=SpellE>violative</span> of the provisions
on human relations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As found by the
trial court, GELAC knew very well of the transfer of the property to the
petitioners on July 14, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>1980 </span>when
it received summons based on the complaint for <span class=SpellE>replevin</span>
filed with the RTC by the petitioner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Notwithstanding said summons, it continued to sell the subject tractor
to one of its stockholders on August 2, 1980.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals
promulgated on March 23, 1990 is SET ASIDE and the decision of the Regional
Trial Court dated April 8, 1988 is REINSTATED.</p>
