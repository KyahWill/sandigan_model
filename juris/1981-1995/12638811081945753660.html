				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari and mandamus seeking to set aside
or annul the September 4, 1980 Resolution of the Court of Agrarian Relations,
16th Regional District, Branch I, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City
dismissing for lack of jurisdiction, petitioner's complaint for Declaration of
Nullity of Certificates of Land Transfer in Court of Agrarian Relations Case
No. 3384 (Davao-1980) entitled, <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabin</span> Agricultural Corporation, etc. vs. Hon. Minister of
Agrarian Reform, et al., as well as the Order dated October 15, 1980 denying
petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fagel</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabin</span> Agricultural Corporation, formerly the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Industrial Development Co. is the owner of a
165-hectare parcel of agricultural land situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lizada</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Toril</span> District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-4089.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On or about March, 1973 or after the issuance of Presidential
Decree No. 27, officials and employees of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform
conducted <span class="SpellE">parcellary</span> map sketching of patches,
pockets or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>portions of land areas
cultivated to corn inside the 165-hectare land and placed the same under the
coverage of Operation Land Transfer (OLT). Subsequently thereafter, the
officials and employees of the Ministry of Agrarian Reform issued corresponding
Certificates of Land Transfer (CLT numbered consecutively from 0368129 to
0368163 inclusive) dated <st1:date month="6" day="8" year="1977">June 8, 1977</st1:date>,
or a total of 35 <span class="SpellE">CLTs</span> with an area coverage of 43.51
hectares out of the 165 hectares land.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 3, 1980, petitioner filed a complaint dated April 30,
1980, for "Declaration of Nullity of Certificates of Land Transfer issued
Illegally and Unlawfully" against respondent "Hon. Minister <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, including
all those claiming authority <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and acting as
Regional Director,, Branch and/or Team Leader or agents of the
Minister/Ministry and the alleged tenant-beneficiaries" in Branch I of the
Court of Agrarian Relations, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, docketed as
CAR Case No. 3384.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the 165-hectare parcel of land was
placed under the coverage of Operation Land Transfer (P.D. 27) in spite of
contrary official findings shown in the official records of the Ministry of
Agrarian Reform, particularly the Survey Map<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 23) of the land prepared and made
by respondents public officials/employees in cooperation with then Bureau of
Lands, allegedly classifying and establishing the landholding in question as
primarily a coconut and rubber land; that the individual <span class="SpellE">CLTs</span>
were issued illegally and unlawfully inasmuch as P.D. No. 27 was distinctly and
expressly made applicable only to tenant-farmers of private agricultural lands
PRIMARILY devoted to rice and corn; that they were issued not only in grave,
and gross abuse of authority and/or discretion amounting to utter lack of
jurisdiction, but more importantly, illegally and contrary to the very law
(P.D. No. 27) that authorized for the first time the issuance of <span class="SpellE">CLTs</span>, and therefore NULL and VOID.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="GramE">respondents</span> public
officials and employees contended that the landholding in question is not
totally primarily devoted to coconuts and rubber and that the entire 165
hectares was not placed under OLT but only such portions as are tenanted and
devoted to the production of corn.</p>

<p class="BODY">As affirmative and special defenses, respondents public officials
and employees contended that the Court of Agrarian Relations<span style="">&nbsp; </span>has no jurisdiction in the case under the
provision of P.D. 946 (Reorganizing the Courts of Agrarian Relations,
Streamlining their Procedures, and for Other Purposes), Section 12[b] which
explicitly provides that "matters involving the administrative
implementation of the transfer of land to the tenant farmer under P.D. No. 27
and amendatory and related decrees, orders, instructions, rules and
regulations, shall be exclusively cognizable by the Secretary of Agrarian
Reform."</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, respondents contended that the <span class="SpellE">CLTs</span>
thus issued were all in accordance with law and by authority of Letter of
Instruction No. 46 issued by the President of the Philippines directing the
respondent Minister of Agrarian Reform to establish priorities in the
implementation of the land reform program of the government pursuant to P.D.
No. 27; that the complaint states no cause of action, plaintiff (herein
petitioner) having failed to exhaust required administrative remedies afforded
to it by law before resorting to the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its reply to answer, petitioner contends that Section 12 [b]
of P.D. No. 946 is very clear and it is precisely upon this authority that the
complaint was filed before the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended by petitioner that it is not a matter
involving the administrative implementation of P.D. No. 27 because what was
covered and transferred in the instant case is not agricultural land primarily
devoted to rice and corn, but rather a landholding primarily devoted to
coconut, rubber, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a preliminary hearing, the Court of Agrarian Relations
issued a Resolution dated <st1:date month="9" day="4" year="1980">September 4,
 1980</st1:date>, dismissing the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied in
an Order dated <st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1980">October 15, 1980</st1:date>
for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raised two (2) legal issues, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">DOES P. D. NO.</span> 27 INCLUDE IN ITS COVERAGE
PORTIONS OF LAND PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO COCONUT, RUBBER AND OTHER PERMANENT

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

"PROVISO" MUST BE STRICTLY CONSTRUED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not respondent judge
erred in dismissing CAR Case No. 3384 for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law (PD 946) provides:</p>

appealed to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
(P.D. No. 946).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be stated that the first and fundamental duty of courts
is to apply the law and construction and interpretation come only after it has
been demonstrated that application is impossible or inadequate without them
(National Federation of Labor vs. <span class="SpellE">Bisma</span>, 127 SCRA
419, 425 [1984]). The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of PD 946
is clear and unambiguous. It provides, as an exception to the original and
exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Agrarian Relations, the subject matters
exclusively cognizable by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform among which are the
classification and identification of land-holdings, the <span class="SpellE">parcellary</span>
mapping in question and the issuance, recall or cancellation of <span class="SpellE">CLTs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
it should be taken to mean exactly what it says. It is elementary rule in
statutory construction that when the words and phrases of a statute are clear
and unequivocal, their meaning must be determined from the language employed
and the statute must be taken to mean exactly what it says. <span class="GramE">(Insular
Bank of Asia and America Employees Union (IBAAEU) vs. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,
132 SCRA 663, 673 [1984]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where
the provision of the law is clear and unambiguous, so that there is no occasion
for the court's seeking legislative intent, the law must be taken as it is,
devoid of judicial addition or subtraction (Insular Lumber Co. vs. Court of
Appeals, 104 SCRA 710, 719 [1981]). Hence, as aptly argued by respondents in
the case at bar, if petitioner did not agree with the Ministry of Agrarian
Reform in placing his landholding under Operation Land Transfer, then he should
have filed his complaint with the Ministry instead of going to court by filing
CAR Case No. 3384, the matter being within the jurisdiction of the Minister of
Agrarian Reform pursuant to the proviso of section 12(b), PD 946.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the case at bar has already become moot and
academic because of the enactment of Republic Act No. 6657 (Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Law of 1988), which include in its coverage "all private
lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural
products raised or that can be raised thereon" (Section 4-d).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Law now covers the landholding in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b>, the instant
petition is <span class="GramE">Dismissed</span> for lack of merit and having
been rendered moot and academic.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
