</span>1982 in the evening, of (sic) Barangay Inayapan, Municipa­lity of Santa
Maria, Province of Laguna and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the above-named accused, then provided with a deadly weapon, with lewd design
and with intent to have carnal knowledge, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation succeed in
having sexual intercourse with one AMANDA REYES VDA. DE MATIBAG, an old woman,
67 years of age against her will and consent, and by reasons on the occasion
thereof, after sexually abusing the aforenamed woman, did then and there
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill, attack and assault
and tie her feet, hands and mouth with a piece of cloth and thereafter drag and
throw said victim, Amanda Reyes Vda. <span class="GramE">de</span> Matibag, into
an irrigation canal with water which caused her death by abdominal distention,
secondary to massive water swallowing, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs
of said victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"CONTRARY TO LAW."</span> (Rollo; p. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused-appellant pleaded not guilty
notwithstanding his admission of guilt in an extra­judicial confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, judgment was rendered, its
dispositive portion reading:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANICIO MASONGSONG y DE
GUZMAN guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE WITH HOMICIDE and
hereby sentences him to suffer the supreme and extreme penalty of DEATH; and to

was based is as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Appellant Anicio Masongsong y de Guzman, 23 years of age,
single, was a farmer residing in Bgy. Bejia, Tiaong, Quezon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1979, he was accused of the crime of
Frustrated Murder, which charge was eventually dropped, in consideration of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which he paid to the offended party (tsn., <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 2-19; tsn., <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="12">Dec. 22, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 19-20).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1981, appellant became close to his uncle, Sergio Ocampo,
when the latter along with his family transferred residence to the same town (<u style="text-underline:words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

  Maria</st1:place></st1:city>, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1981, he sold it to the victim, Amanda Reyes Vda. <span class="GramE">de</span>
Matibag, a 67 year old widow, residing in the same place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the sale, the old woman immediately
occupied the house but allowed Sergio and family to stay until they finally
moved out to Tiaong, Quezon (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="12">Dec. 3, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 2-19).</blockquote>

appellant went with Sergio to attend a fiesta celebration in Sta. Maria, Laguna

<blockquote>"At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time> in the
evening, they proceeded to the town plaza to watch an amateur singing
contest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While in the town plaza, they
met by chance Felisa Macalindong, the victim's daughter, who was also there
watching.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Sergio smiled at her,
Felisa readily recognized him, taking noticed of appellant whom she saw for the
first time (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="12">Dec. 3, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 2-19).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After watching the amateur contest, Sergio and appellant left
the town plaza.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On their way, they
agreed to steal chickens and pig at the victim's house at Bgy. Inayapan
(Records, Extra-Judicial confession, Exhibit "P”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching the place, Sergio immediately went under the
house and stole the pig tied to a post and some chickens inside a pen (<u style="text-underline:words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, appellant ascended the house and seeing
the old woman, immediately grabbed and forcibly laid her on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim shouted for help, but appellant
took out his knife and threatened to kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant ripped off her clothes with the knife and mounted her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After taking off her panties, appellant
hastily unzipped his pants, took out his penis, inserting it into the victim's
vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The old woman could only cry in
silence, suffering the extreme pain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
forcible sexual intercourse being perpetrated on her (<u style="text-underline:
words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the bestial act, appellant tied the victim's hands and
hurried down the house to look for Sergio (<u style="text-underline:words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When he did not find his uncle, appellant proceeded to leave
(<u style="text-underline:words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As he was leaving, however, he saw the old woman (having
freed herself) running towards the ricefields.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant gave chase and easily overtook her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He securely tied the victim's hands with a
string, her feet with her own brassieres and covered her mouth with a white shirt
(<u>id</u>.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having bound the victim,
appellant mercilessly junked the old woman into an irriga­tion canal, drowning
her in the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then fled to
Siniloan, Quezon seeking refuge at a friend's house (<u>id</u>.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the next day, <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="8">August
 17, 1982</st1:date>, Pedro Tromaneri, the barangay captain of Inayapan and
victim's son-in-law received a report that a dead person was found floating in
the irrigation canal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro, along with
the other officers of the barangay and police department, rushed to the
place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They saw the body float­ing on
the water, about a meter high.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they
retrieved the old woman, Pedro recognized her to be his mother-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim was not wearing underwears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hands and feet were still as tightly
bound and her mouth was covered with a white shirt (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span>
<st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1982</st1:date>, pp.
18-36).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Cynthia Silva, the rural health physi­cian of Sta. Maria
who examined the cadaver, declared her post-mortem findings, as follows:</blockquote>

swallowing' (Exh<span class="GramE">. "</span>A").</p>

<blockquote>"In court, Dr. Silva explained that the vaginal laceration was
still possible, the victim being an aged widow whose opening had already
narrowed (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="11">Nov. 5, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 4-17).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meantime, a certain Rodolfo Padilla surrendered the stolen
pig (placed inside a sack and which was supposedly entrusted to him by Sergio)
to Sgt. Ednalino, a constabulary officer at the PC Detachment in Bgy. Nanguma,
Mabitac, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A pair of blue rubber
shoes was likewise recovered from the same sack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="11">Nov. 19, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 5-29).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Felisa who was then in the PC Station readily recognized the
pig as the same pig stolen from her mother and the pair of shoes as that <span class="GramE">worn</span> by Sergio at the town plaza in the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She informed the PC that Sergio was
accompanied by appellant in the evening of the incident (<u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When asked for the description of the two, Felisa replied
that she could not recall appellant's features since it was the first time she
had ever seen him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As regards Sergio,
Felisa described him as tall, with pointed chin, chinky eyes and wearing a
yellow striped T-shirt (<u>id</u>.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sgt. Balleber then inquired if she knew their
whereabouts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Felisa said that Sergio
stayed at the time in the bakery owned by a cer­tain Narding Diola in Sta.
Maria (<u>id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When they went to the place, an old woman informed them that
Sergio, along with a short and pimpled fellow, had just left and gone to a
house behind the cemetery in Siniloan, Quezon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PC </span>proceeded
to the said place and saw three persons conversing with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Balleber inquired from them if they knew
Sergio.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, a short and dimpled
man, asked why he was interested in Sergio. Sgt. Balleber replied that Sergio
was in fact his 'compadre'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
then told him that Sergio was his uncle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suspecting that appellant was indeed Sergio's companion in the evening
of the incident, Sgt. Balleber pointed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">at
</span>appellant saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="GramE">So</span> you were the one who killed the old woman!'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant immediately turned pale and
speechless (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="11">Nov. 19, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 32-35).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After a while, Sgt. Balleber asked appellant where Sergio
could be found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant said his uncle
had already gone to Tiaong, Quezon (<u style="text-underline:words">id</u>.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The PC then brought appellant along to Tiaong, Quezon where
Sergio was duly apprehended (<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="11">Nov. 19, 1982</st1:date>, pp. 36-37)." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(Rollo, </span>pp. 115-122)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>accused-appellant

<p class="BODY">Considering that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">two </span>assigned
errors are closely interrelated, we shall discuss them jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's main contention is that his extra?judicial
confession should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>have been
accepted considering that there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no

7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the records clearly show
that the extra­judicial confession was not the sole basis for his
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were pieces of other
evidence presented, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the
testimonies of Dr. Cynthia Silva, Pedro Tromaneri, Sgt. Jesus Balleber, Juanito
Ednalino, and Felisa Macalindong, the picture of the victim's geni­talia, the
footprints near the dam and the shoes of the companion of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When brought to the police station,
co-accused Sergio Ocampo pointed to the appellant as the one who killed the old
woman because he was left there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">tsn.,</span> <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="11">Nov. 26,
 1982</st1:date>, pp. 2-14).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the cause of death of the victim was sufficiently proven.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is nothing in the
records to suggest that the prosecution witnesses were ill-motivated and had
any grudge or ill-feeling against <span class="GramE">appellant,</span> or that </span>they
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">received any </span>compensation<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">or</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Second, there </span>is
reason for us<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reject the extrajudicial confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional requirement </span>of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Masongsong was told of
his right to have a lawyer to assist him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He stated that he had no money to pay for a lawyer and that he needed no
lawyer to aid him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When told that the
government would provide him with the free services of counsel, he expressed
his thanks and then conferred with Atty. Cenon Realeza of Siniloan, Laguna who
was appointed to assist him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only
after the conference that he gave a statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The statement was taken in the presence of Fiscal Felipe Arcigal,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional requirements were
sufficiently met.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in
the records to suggest the alleged psycholo­gical and physical coercion
employed against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">To accept the appellant's
contention that he was in effect denied justice since the counsel assigned to
him was not really his choice is ridiculous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As correctly stated by the Solicitor General, every lawyer is presumed to
have knowledge of the law as well as the training in procedure sufficient to
enable him to protect his Client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the accused was given sufficient time to choose his own
counsel had he opted to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">His failure, therefore, to request for another counsel negates his
claim of denial of the right to choose his lawyer.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no proof that
the extrajudicial confession was secured through duress, intimidation, or
improper inducement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant did not exert any effort to complain about the alleged
physical injuries that he now alleges on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was neither a medical certificate to
show that a physical examination was conducted which would show any injury
sustained by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
charges were explained to him and he was apprised of his rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these were explained to him in Tagalog,
the dialect in Laguna where he lived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The extrajudicial
confession jibed in its details with </span>the other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">evidence presented as well as the testimonies given.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the above, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">we
</span>are constrained to accept the extrajudicial confession, it appearing
that the same has been corroborated on all material points by the other
evidence presented.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The defense of the
accused-appellant is mainly alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
records, however, not only show that it was not impossible for him to be at the
scene of the crime at the time of the incident but precisely fixed his presence
in the house where the rape was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court has held in a sufficient number of cases that alibi is a
defense easily fabricated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
distance from Siniloan, Laguna where the appellant places himself at the time
of the incident and Sta. Maria where the incident happened does not preclude
the possibility that the appellant committed the crime (People v. Santillan, <u>supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused-appellant's
actuations are likewise indicative of guilt rather than innocence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the two occasions when he was
confronted, he never denied the charges made against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to usual human beha­vior, the
appellant kept silent instead of protesting if he were truly innocent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records also reveal that immediately
after the commission of the crime, the accused fled to a friend's house in
Siniloan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court has held in
not a few cases that flight after the incident is indicative of guilt (People
v. Reunir, 157 SCRA 686 [1988]; People v. Masangkay, 157 SCRA 320 [1988]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the accused-appellant contends that he was not positively
identified as the perpetrator of the crime since there was no witness to the
actual commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of witnesses in rape cases is not unusual as the
offended party, more often than not, is the only one available to prove the
commission of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rape is
usually done with the least possibility of being seen by the public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the presence of eyewitnesses could
even raise serious doubts (People v. Landicho, 43 O.G. 3167).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the only person who
could testify against the accused-appellant, namely, the victim <span class="GramE">herself,</span> was hogtied, thrown into an irrigation canal and
left to drown.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The records of the case
