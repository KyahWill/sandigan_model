				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The sole issue to be resolved in this petition for review on certiorari is:&nbsp; Does the appellant's failure to pay the appellate court docket fee within the fifteen-day reglementary period result in the automatic dismissal of his appeal?<br><br>In Civil Case No. 173, an action for damages entitled "<i>Ruben Bonsubre, et. al., versus Diosdado Pelayo, et. al."</i>, the then Municipal Circuit Court of Bogo-San Remigio, Cebu, found herein petitioners jointly and severally liable to private respondents in the amounts of P6,829.10 as actual damages, P1,000.00 as moral damages, P600.00 as exemplary damages, P800.00 as attorney's fees, plus interest on said amounts from the time the complaint was filed until fully paid, and costs of the suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Following receipt of the decision dated September 1, 1978 and within the reglementary period, petitioners filed with the municipal circuit court by registered mail a notice of appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and appeal bond dated September 25, 1978<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>.&nbsp; Private respondents filed a motion to dismiss the appeal dated October 23, 1978 on the ground that petitioners failed to comply with the provisions of Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court on perfection of appeal as they have not delivered any postal money order for the amount of the appellate court docket fee nor presented a certificate from the municipal treasurer showing that they have deposited such appellate court docket fee within the 15-day reglementary period which lapsed on September 4, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Petitioners opposed the motion to dismiss appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>, attributing their failure to pay the appellate court docket fee to the fact that they were awaiting notice from the Clerk of Court of the Municipal Circuit Court of Bogo-San Remegio on the exact amount of said fee.<br><br>On November 13, 1978, the Municipal Circuit Court issued an order dismissing the appeal of petitioners for failure to perfect the same within the 15-day reglementary period pursuant to Section 2, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration, but the same was likewise denied in an order dated November 29, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Assailing the aforesaid order of dismissal of appeal as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, petitioners filed on December 26, 1978 a petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction with the then CFI of Cebu docketed as Civil Case No. 17649, alleging among others, that unless restrained, respondent Judge Galicano C. Arriesgado of the Municipal Circuit Court of Bogo-San Remegio will order the execution of the decision in Civil Case No. 173 to the great prejudice and injustice to petitioners.<br><br>After private respondents' answer to the petition had been filed, the parties were required to submit their respective memorandum in an order dated March 30, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> For failure of petitioners to file their memorandum, the CFI of Cebu, Branch VIII dismissed the case on May 7, 1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> but on a motion for reconsideration, the order of dismissal was lifted and set aside on June 14, 1979.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On November 9, 1979, a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> was rendered by the then CFI of Cebu, Branch VIII dismissing the petition for certiorari with preliminary injunction declaring, among others, that the payment of the appellate court docket fee is mandatory for the purpose of perfecting an appeal, thus:<br><blockquote>"x x x This Court cannot draw a parallel situation in the matter of payment of the docket fee on an appeal from the inferior court to the CFI, on one hand, with that of payment of the docket fee by reason of an appeal from the CFI to the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; In the former, tender is jurisdictional.&nbsp; In the latter, an appeal is perfected by mere submission of the notice of appeal, the appeal bond and the record on appeal.&nbsp; Otherwise stated, payment of the docket fee on appeal from the CFI is not mandatory.&nbsp; x x x"</blockquote>Hence, this petition, praying that the decision of the then CFI of Cebu, Branch VIII in Civil Case No. 17649 be set aside; that petitioners be allowed to pay the appellate court docket fee in Civil Case No. 173 and that the appeal be given due course.<br><br>The issue raised, as above stated has been squarely resolved under a similar set of circumstances in the case of <i>NAWASA vs. Secretary of Public Works and Communications,</i> 16 SCRA 536 (1966) wherein this Court, speaking thru Justice J. B. L. Reyes, laid down the rule that in appealed cases, the failure to pay the appellate court docket fee does not automatically result in the dismissal of the appeal, much less affect the court's jurisdiction, the dismissal being discretionary in the appellate court, and that this rule is applicable by analogy to Courts of First Instance in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred upon them.&nbsp; Thus:<br><blockquote>"In its first assignment of error, the defendant Secretary contends that, admitting that the NAWASA's complaint in (sic) appeal was sent by registered mail on the last of the 30 days allowed by the Irrigation Act for appealing the administrative decision to the court of competent jurisdiction, still the complaint may not be deemed to have been filed on the same day, for the reason that there is no showing that the filing fees were simultaneously paid.<br><br>"The appellant's argument, however, fails to take into account that, in appealed cases, failure to pay the docketing fees does not automatically result in the dismissal of the appeal; the dismissal is discretionary in the appellate court.&nbsp; Rule 141, Section 3, speaking of the fees of the clerk of the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, provides that:<br><blockquote>'If the fees are not paid, the court may refuse to proceed with the action until they are paid and may dismiss the appeal or the action or proceeding.'<br></blockquote>"The rule quoted is applicable by analogy to the Court of First Instance of Manila in the instant case, since the Court was exercising appellate jurisdiction conferred upon it by law to review administrative decisions under the Irrigation Act."</blockquote>In the subsequent cases of <i>Favis vs. Municipality of Sabangan,</i> 27 SCRA 92 (1969), <i>Lopez vs. Court of Appeals,</i> 75 SCRA 401 (1977), <i>Panes vs. Court of Appeals, </i>120 SCRA 509 (1983) and more recently in the case of <i>Del Rosario &amp; Sons Logging Enterprises, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, et. al., </i>136 SCRA 669 (1985), this Court not only emphasized the rule that the failure to pay the appellate court docket fee within the 15-day reglementary period confers a directory, not mandatory power to dismiss the proposed appeal, but further stated that such power should be used in the exercise of the Court's sound discretion "in accordance with the tenets of justice and fair play"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> and with a great deal of circumspection considering all attendant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>In <i>Siquenza vs. Court of Appeals,</i> 137 SCRA 570 (1985), this Court restated the importance and real purpose of the remedy of appeal as an essential part of our judicial system<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> and advised the courts to proceed with caution so as not to deprive a party of the right to appeal<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> with the instruction that every party-litigant should be afforded the amplest opportunity for the proper and just disposition of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Rightly so, for the payment of the appellate court docket fee is not a requirement for the protection of the prevailing party, and non-compliance therewith within the time prescribed causes no substantial prejudice to anyone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>In the instant case, petitioners as early as October 30, 1978 in their opposition to the motion to dismiss appeal, prayed that they be allowed to pay the appellate court docket fee.&nbsp; They recognized that the payment of appellate court docket fee is a requirement for the perfection of an appeal under the Rules of Court, but attributed their failure to pay said fee to the fact that they were awaiting notice from the Clerk of Court on the exact amount thereof.&nbsp; Taken in the light of the liberal stance adopted by this Court regarding the payment of appellate court docket fee, as enunciated in <i>Lopez vs. Court of Appeals, supra,</i> that:<br><blockquote>"To apply to petitioners the legal requirements strictly, would not only tend to block the right of review to which a party is entitled under the law, but also would amount to a complete departure from what We said in the cases of <i>Philippine National Bank vs. Philippine Milling Co., Inc., et. al. </i> (26 SCRA 712, 715) and <i>reiterated in Maqui &amp; Maqui vs. Court of Appeals, et. al.</i>&nbsp; (L-41609, February 24, 1976, 69 SCRA 368) that the provisions of Section 1, Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court, which provides grounds for dismissal of appeal "manifestly confers a power and does not impose a duty.&nbsp; What is more, it is directory, not mandatory.&nbsp; Hence, it should be exercised with a great deal of circumspection, considering all the attendant circumstances."</blockquote>the reason given by petitioners is satisfactory.&nbsp; The re­jection by the Municipal Circuit Court thereof and the consequent dismissal of petitioners' appeal resulted in a too rigid application of the Rules of Court which We cannot countenance.<br><br>Under Section 20 of the Interim Rules and Guide­lines<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> issued by this Court on January 11, 1983 relative to the implementation of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1981 (B.P.
