<p class="BODY">The factual background of this case as found by the trial court
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The accused Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> and the deceased victim Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>
were legally married by a Roman Catholic priest in <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, their marriage being entered in the local civil
registry on December 10, 1970 (Exhibit “F”).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They have a son and the three of them stayed with Benita <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span>, a 65-year-old woman, who had adopted Milagros, in
a house situated in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Abungon</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Lomboc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.</blockquote>

at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, Milagros and Pedro asked permission from Benita and left for the
seashore to go fishing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day,
Milagros returned alone at around noontime, telling Benita that Pedro had gone
to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Santander</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, to borrow money and will
return on Tuesday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that afternoon,
some small children came and told Benita that Pedro was already dead and his
body had been brought to town by the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As Benita was then sick, she sent Milagros to verify but the latter
never returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benita learned
afterwards that Milagros had been jailed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After some time, Benita executed a written statement before the police
(Exhibit “A”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In that evening of <st1:date year="1977" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1977</st1:date>, Alma <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, a 12-year-old
student residing at barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
had gone to the novena prayers for the month of May.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the novena, <st1:city><st1:place>Alma</st1:place></st1:city>
went to the store of one <span class="SpellE">Inting</span> Lim to return the
lighted <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span> lamp which was used in the
chapel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the store, she saw accused
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>, her husband Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>, and one <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>, seated inside and afterwards leave at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00 o’clock p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, <st1:city><st1:place>Alma</st1:place></st1:city>
learned that Pedro had died and she saw his dead body in the beach, with the
nearest house some 50-60 meters away, and also a little distance from the store
of <span class="SpellE">Inting</span> Lim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">After </span>she told her mother
about seeing Pedro, Milagros and <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> the
previous evening, she was investigated by the police the day after the body was
found.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span>,
a 26-year old farmer residing also in barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>,
went to the sea on <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1977</st1:date>
and returned to his house at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o’clock
 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw a woman near his
house, <span class="GramE">whom</span> he had not met before and who later turned
out to be the accused Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked his wife who the woman was and also
asked the woman what her purpose was in being there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The woman replied that she was looking for Ely or <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> asked her
why and she said she had something to tell to Ely which she could not tell
anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pressed her to state her
purpose and she finally revealed that she wanted Ely to kill her husband
because she could not bear his maltreatment anymore and that he had even pushed
her adopted mother over a cliff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> advised her not to go ahead with her plans but
separate from her husband since if she had him killed, it would be a sin
against God.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“However, <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> pointed to the woman
where Ely was living, which was across the creek from his own house some 60-70
meters away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ely was staying there with
his friend Manuel, while Ely’s younger brother <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
was living in his own house at about the same distance from <span class="SpellE">Simplicio’s</span>
house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> learned about the incident
where Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> had been killed the next
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he went fishing, he met a
policeman at the corner and told him about his encounter the previous day with
the woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police had him execute a
statement on <st1:date year="1977" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1977</st1:date>
(Exhibits “1-MC” and “1-a-MC”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span>,
officer-in-charge of the <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> police station, received a report of an
unusual incident in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tapi</span>,
barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00
 o’clock a.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="5">May 22,
 1977</st1:date>, from one <span class="SpellE">Elpidio</span> <span class="SpellE">Detuya</span>, a barrio resident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Together with five other policemen, he went to the crime scene and saw a
dead body which was identified later to be that of one Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> by a neighbor of the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> saw injuries on the top
and back of the head, on the nape and on the throat of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw an empty bottle of <span class="SpellE">Tru</span>-Orange and pieces of bloody stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were streaks of blood from the body to
the seashore and the scene was in a secluded place at a very low portion of the
beach, with the nearest house belonging to <span class="SpellE">Orencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> some 80 meters away, but obstructed by trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span>
brought the bottle (Exhibit “H”) and the two (2) pieces of bloody stones
(Exhibits “I” and “I-1”) with him and kept it in his office steel cabinet
before turning it over to the municipal court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“He requested the barrio captain to have the dead body carried and
placed in the barrio chapel where Dr. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabigon</span> conducted an autopsy, after which contributions
were asked from the barrio people for expenses of burial as the victim had no
relatives.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the evening of <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="5">May 22,
 1977</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o’clock</st1:time>,
Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> arrived in the <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>
municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because she admitted
her participation in the killing, she was placed in jail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police looked for witnesses and found <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span> and Alma <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, whose statements were taken (Exhibits “B” and
“C”).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the statement of Benita <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span> was taken also.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> gave a statement
(Exhibit “D”) after she was informed of her constitutional rights and she
submitted to an investigation as she was telling only the truth, after which
she signed it and subscribed to it before the municipal judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> also declared that
Milagros was not arrested but came alone to the municipal building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 23rd, she gave her first statement before
him, but a second statement on May 24th before Police Lt. <span class="SpellE">Bancog</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Alegria</span> Station Commander, where she excluded her
co-accused <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first statement was thrown away by
administrative officer <span class="SpellE">Debilleres</span> without Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span>’ knowledge or consent after the second statement
was taken.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On May 25th, Milagros executed a third statement which was the
same as her first statement given on May 23rd after telling Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> that she gave the second statement only because
she was afraid of Lt. <span class="SpellE">Bancog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During that period, Milagros was not actually
placed in jail but was allowed to stay in the police station office as she was
sick and had to be treated by a doctor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her first statement was not subscribed, while her second and third
statements were subscribed before the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> was implicated in the first and third statements
together with <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>,
but in the second statement only <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> was
implicated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> further declared that <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> was taken into
custody for the first time on the 23rd of May, after he was picked up after
going to barrio <span class="SpellE">Bato</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samboan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> and when he returned in
the evening to his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When brought
to the <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span> municipal building, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> denied any participation in the crime after
Milagros pointed to him, claiming that he could not be at the scene because he
had an altercation with his brother <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> who
chopped his fishing net.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Milagros
insisted he was present at the killing, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> said
that she was saying nonsense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“After Lt. <span class="SpellE">Bancog</span> took the second
statement of Milagros, wherein <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> was excluded,
the latter was released, but re-arrested on board a bus in <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning of the 27th of May after
Milagros executed her third statement implicating him again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Finally, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> declared that a <span class="SpellE"><span style="">buri</span></span><span style=""> </span>bag (Exhibit “J”) identified to be
belonging to the victim and a T-shirt with red and white stripes and with
cut-off sleeves (Exhibit “E”) which allegedly belong to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
according to Milagros, were found also at the crime scene, together with a
piece of broken glass apparently coming from the neck of a bottle cap (Exhibit
“H-2”), which were turned over to the municipal judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While no evidence of a bonfire or empty shells
of seafood were found at the crime scene, however, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span>
went to a nearby area near a bridge beside the seashore pointed to by Milagros
where he found bits of leftover food.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Dr. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Cabigon</span>,
Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, was called by the police while attending
mass on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1977</st1:date>, to
examine the dead body of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw the body on a stretcher inside the
chapel in a state of rigor <span class="GramE">mortis,</span> and estimated that
it had been dead less than 24 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
examined the wounds, removed the scalp and conducted an autopsy of the
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prepared his post-mortem
examination report on the same day (Exhibit “G” and “G-1”) wherein he listed
and described his physical findings as follows:</blockquote>

for the fiesta in barrio <span class="SpellE">Lomboc</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked her about her husband and if he had
the same traits still, which Milagros knew referred to Pedro’s being very
possessive and being angry at any person of either sex who visits her in her
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He added that if he had been
living long near her place, he would have killed Pedro long ago, and that he
had killed several persons in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:place>

did not reply anymore and Milagros proceeded on her way to <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span>’

breakfast and lunch home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After lunch, Pedro

Exhibit “H”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She approached <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>, telling him, ‘Do not do that Ely, because my
husband had not committed any offense.’ <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>
brushed her aside, telling her not to meddle so that she will not be
included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pedro also said, ‘Don’t do
that, Ely, are you going to kill me?’ Pedro had fallen on his back and <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> choked him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> suddenly appeared from behind a big

replied that he might be making a surveillance of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, she lay down to rest.</blockquote>

and informed Milagros and Mama Benita that the dead body of Pedro had been
brought to <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benita told Milagros to go to <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span> immediately and she left at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o’clock p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>,

without reading it and neither was it read to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She signed and subscribed the same before a
judge because the police <span style="">said </span>that
if he (sic) signs it, they can help her and she will stay in jail only for one
night, and if not, they will either hang her or burn her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also not feeling well when she signed
the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While admitting that
there were portions in said statement which were true and some which were not
true, Milagros denied that she had agreed with <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>
to kill her husband, that she was present when Pedro was pounded with stones
and his wallet taken, that she was <span class="SpellE">Elisardo’s</span>
paramour and had slept with him after the killing, and that she had given
P12.00 to <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> after the killing of Pedro.</blockquote>

morning of May 20th, and that she was looking for <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>
as she wanted to hire him to kill her husband who was abusing her and even
tried to push Benita.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> bore a grudge against her ever since harvest time
last year when <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> and his wife stayed with her
in her house and <span class="GramE">she</span> drove them out at night when <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> was drunk and mock a lady visitor.</blockquote>

to go to town to ask for help but <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> overtook
her on the way and threatened her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, she admitted that, while there were several houses near the
scene of the incident, she did not go to any of them to ask for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also admitted that even though she knew <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> to be a bad character with a police record in <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span> and had even previously quarreled and boxed her
husband, she did not dissuade him from going to the beach that fateful night
with <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, she admitted that the wallet (Exhibit “K”) and the <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat (Exhibit “J”) belonged to Pedro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she declared that it took her almost
seven (7) hours to leave the beach where Pedro was killed and reached her home
because she walked slowly.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of this appeal is that appellant was not afforded
the right to confront Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> whose
testimony implicated him in this case and was the primordial basis of his
conviction.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show, however, that counsel <u>de </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></span>
for appellant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>
had all the opportunity during the trial to cross-examine Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> but did not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">He </span>manifested instead that
he would impugn the damaging declarations of co-accused Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> through the testimony of his client and his
corroborating witnesses, when the time comes for the presentation of
appellant’s defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Appellee’s</span> Brief, pp. 20-21; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 127)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, readily evident that appellant thru counsel
waived his right of confrontation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
opportunity of cross-examination having been secured, the function and test of
confrontation has also been accomplished (U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Anastacio</span>,
6 Phil. 413 [1906]).</p>

<p class="BODY">No less important is the fact that the trial court did not
entirely rely on the third extrajudicial confession (Exhibit “D”) of Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> as the sole evidence to prove conspiracy of
appellant with his co-accused in the killing of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution adduced credible evidence
consisting of the things, acts and declarations testified to and/or presented
in court by its witnesses with respect to the circumstances of previous time
and place which were confirmed substantially by Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>
when she testified as defense witness in her behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial court took into
consideration, separately from said Exhibit “D”, the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span>, Alma <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span>, Benita <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span>, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> of <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span> Police

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Simplicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Daplas</span> testified that Milagros was at the vicinity of his
house at barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span> looking for <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o’clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed to her the place where <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> resided, and she proceeded to the place pointed
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution witness Alma <span class="SpellE">Licaros</span> testified that she saw Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> together at the store of <span class="SpellE">Inting</span>

the beach where the dead body of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> was
later found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Benita <span class="SpellE">Baylosis</span>,
adopted mother of Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span>, declared that
Milagros went with her husband at 4:00 o’clock in the afternoon of May 21,
1977, to go fishing, but she returned alone the next day at around noontime,
telling Benita that Pedro had gone to <span class="SpellE">Santander</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, to borrow money when the truth of the matter was that
Pedro had already been assaulted and killed the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span>
testified as to his official ocular inspection of the dead body and the things
he found at the scene of the crime, consisting of <span class="SpellE">buri</span>
bag, red T-shirt, bloody stones, empty bottle and parts thereof, and black
plastic cap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw several injuries on
the top and back of the head, nape and on the throat of the deceased
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also saw streaks of blood
from the body at the seashore, and bits of left-over food on the beach near the
bridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the post-mortem examination
report of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Cabigon</span>,
Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Malabuyoc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, on his autopsy of the cadaver of the deceased Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> as well as his testimony in court on said report
and his autopsy, it was shown that the deceased victim sustained around fifteen
(15) wounds or injuries all over his body, especially on his head and neck,
five of which were fatal ones, and the cause of the victim’s death was
“hemorrhage, shock, secondary to violent physical injuries (skull)”, thus
showing that said injuries were inflicted by more than one person or assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the foregoing evidence, testimonial and real as well as the
finding of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Manlunas</span> from his inspection of the
scene of the crime and the nature and seriousness of the victim’s wounds
corroborate the statements of Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> in
the questioned extrajudicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than that, the chain of circumstances found by the trial
court unerringly points to the complicity between the appellant and his
co-accused in the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">A careful review of the records how that all three
accused were together and acted in concert in the execution of their criminal
design.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were animated by the
same purpose, that of bringing about the death of the victim and the evidence
show that by their very acts during and after the commission of the crime, they
were acting in concert.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, among other things, in her testimony in court, Milagros <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> narrated certain incidents and events before and
during the existence of the criminal conspiracy, which are the basis of the
trial court’s findings that she lured her husband to the beach in barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span> in the evening of May 22, 1977, that in the
execution thereof, appellant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>, in cooperation with his brother <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>, choked and
stoned the victim Pedro <span class="SpellE">Camahalan</span> to death, while she
stood by watching them and thereafter, she and <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> went to the latter’s house where they slept
together for the night while <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> went separately on his way home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a testimony coming from the mouth of a
co-conspirator must be accepted with caution, the court is justified in giving
credit to the same if no part thereof has been shown to be false (People <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>,
6 SCRA 391[1971]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the very
death weapons found at the crime scene consisting of empty <span class="SpellE">Tru</span>-Orange
bottle, two pieces of bloodstained stones, a broken bottle with a black plastic
cap, actual use of which was not only admitted by accused Milagros but can be
deduced from the nature of the injuries inflicted on the victim, confirmed the
conspiracy heretofore shown.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, as co-conspirator, the accused is equally
responsible for the acts of his conspirators (People v. <span class="SpellE">Manlolo</span>
and Garcia, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-40778, January 28, 1989; People v. <span class="SpellE">Jusep</span>, 157 SCRA 248 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tamba</span>,
147 SCRA 427 [1987]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the appellant’s defense is alibi; however,
later on he admitted that he w<span style="">as </span>at
the crime scene but alleges that he did not do anything there which had any
relation with the crime (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>, on May 21, 1977, at around past 6:00 o’clock
in the evening, he and his cousin Alfredo went to the seashore of <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span> to catch fish to provide viands for their supper
that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were fishing, <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> called the appellant and asked the latter if they
had already a big catch of shrimps so that they can broil some.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant replied that they had a few and
told <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> to get the shrimps from the <span style="">container.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span class="GramE">After <span class="SpellE">Elisardo</span> got
the shrimps for broiling, <span style="">appellant </span>and
Alfredo continued fishing and did not join <span class="SpellE">Elisardo’s</span>
group.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 8:30 o’clock that
same night, appellant and Alfredo stopped fishing as they had then caught a
variety of fish and shrimps and both went back home together to <span class="SpellE">Servanda</span> <span class="SpellE">Carcedo’s</span> house. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They arrived in said place at around 9:30 P.M.
and their catch was immediately cooked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Servanda</span> and her children ate their late supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, they drank some tuba and later on
went to sleep together in the same house and never went out of the house until
the following morning (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 10-12).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found <span class="SpellE">Teodoro’s</span> defense
of alibi untenable besides being weak and apparently bearing earmarks of
fabrication (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 34).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled rule that alibi is a weak defense for it is easy of
fabrication (People v. Ragas, 44 SCRA 152 [1972]; People v. Mori, 55 SCRA 382
[1974]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dereje</span>, 56 SCRA 554 [1974]; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Zapatero</span>, 58 SCRA 450 [1974]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Perante</span>, Jr., 143 SCRA 56 [1986]; People v. Coronado, 145
SCRA 250 [1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the defense of
alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere when
the crime was committed but that he must likewise demonstrate that it was
physically impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime (People v.
<span class="SpellE">Benaraba</span>, 129 SCRA 266 [1984]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, 37 SCRA 601 [1971]; People v. Diaz, 55 SCRA 178
[1974]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Turalba</span>, 55 SCRA 697 [1974]; People
v. <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, 57 SCRA 114 [1974]; People v. Cortez, 57
SCRA 308 [1974]; and People v. Coronado, <u>supra</u>; People v. Pineda, 157
SCRA 71 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Masangkay</span>, 157 SCRA 320
[1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Santillan</span>, 157 SCRA 534 [1988];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Escabarte</span>, 158 SCRA 602 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Aninon</span>, 158 SCRA 701 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, taking into consideration that the appellant
was then fishing at the seashore of barrio <span class="SpellE">Montanesa</span>
which is only a hailing distance from the scene of the crime, the possibility
of his being physically present at the latter <span style="">site </span>cannot be seriously doubted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, he admitted that the other group
arrived while he and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span> were fishing and
roasting shrimps and he even gave some to the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the process, he corroborated and supported
Milagros’ testimony with his own (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the record shows that <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
attempted twice to flee from the authorities, a fact indicative of guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, <span style="">this </span>case
furnishes another occasion to reiterate the settled doctrine that the appellate
courts will not disturb the factual findings of the trial court especially as
to <span style="">credibility </span>of witnesses; that
conclusions and findings of fact <span style="">by </span>the
trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed
unless for strong and cogent reasons because the trial court is in a better
position to examine real evidence, as <span style="">well
</span>as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses <span style="">while </span>testifying (People v. <span class="SpellE">Adones</span>, 144
SCRA 364 [1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span>, 144 SCRA 429
[1986]; People v. Cruz, Sr., 151 SCRA 609 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>,
148 SCRA 60 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records, no cogent reason could be
found to disturb the findings and conclusions of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is Affirmed with the
modification that the indemnity is raised to P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
