and owned by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> and Socorro <span class="SpellE">Tabligan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The duplex-apartment house was built for the spouses by private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Candido</span>
Ramos, a duly licensed architect and building contractor, at a total cost of
P32,927.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses paid private
respondent the sum of P7,139.00 only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the latter used his own money, P25,788.50 in all, to finish the
construction of the duplex-apartment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1966</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1967</st1:date>,
and <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1967</st1:date>, the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Tabligan</span> obtained from petitioner Philippine
Savings Bank three (3) loans in the total amount of P35,000.00, the purpose of
which was to complete the construction of the duplex-apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To secure payment of the loans, the spouses
executed in favor of the petitioner three (3) promissory notes and three (3)
deeds of real estate mortgages over the property subject matter of this litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1966</st1:date>,
the petitioner registered the <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1966</st1:date> deed of real estate mortgage with the Register of Deeds of
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subse­quent mortgages of <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1967</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1967</st1:date>, were registered
with the Register of Deeds of Manila on <st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="2">February
 2, 1967</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1967</st1:date>,
respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the
registration of these mortgages, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 86195 was
free from all liens and encumbrances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses failed to pay their monthly amortizations. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>As a result thereof, the petitioner bank
foreclosed the mortgages, and at the public auction held on July 23, 1969, was
the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1969</st1:date>,
the petitioner bank registered the certificate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1970</st1:date>, the
bank consolidated its ownership over the property in question, and Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 101864 was issued by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">Register of Deeds of Manila in the name of the petitioner bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the private respondent filed an action against
the spouses to collect the unpaid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">cost </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the construction of the
duplex-apartment before the Court of First Instance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

attachment, and pursuant thereto, had the property in question attached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a notice of adverse <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">claim </span>was annotated at the back of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 86195.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1968</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered in Civil Case No. 69228 in favor of the private res­pondent
and against the spouses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A writ of
execution was accordingly issued but was returned unsatis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">fied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As the spouses did not have any properties to satisfy the
judgment in Civil Case No. 69228, the private respondent addressed a letter to
the petitioner for the delivery to him (private respondent) of his pro-rata
share in the value <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the
duplex-apartment in accordance with Article 2242 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner refused to pay the pro-rata
value prompting the private respon­dent to file the instant action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">a </span>decision was rendered in favor of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the <u>De <span class="SpellE">Barretto</span></u> decision,
the full application of Articles 2242 and 2249 demands that there must first be

proceeding of similar import may be considered to have been conducted in the

property involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 101864 issued in favor of the bank which is
supposed to be indefeasible would remain constantly unstable and
questionable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such could not have been

<p class="BODY">Respondent Ramos admitted in the partial sti­pulation of facts
submitted by both parties that at the time of the loans to the spouses, the
petitioner bank had no actual or constructive knowledge of any lien against the
property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The duplex
apartment house was built for P32,927.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The spouses <span class="SpellE">Tabligan</span> borrowed P35,000.00 for
the construction of the apartment house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bank could not have known of any contractor's lien because, as far
as it was concerned, it financed the entire construction even if the stated purpose
of the loans was only to "complete" the construction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the action filed by the private respondent is not one which
can be considered as "equivalent general liquidation" having the same
import as an insolvency or settlement of the decedent's estate proceeding, the
well established principle must be applied, that a purchaser in good faith <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">and for value takes registered land free from
liens and encumbrances other than statutory liens and those recorded in the
Certificate of Title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an admitted
fact that at the time the deeds of real estate mortgage in favor of the
petitioner bank were constituted, the transfer certificate of title of the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Tagliban</span> was free from any record</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">e</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">d
lien and encumbrances, so that the only registered liens in the title were
deeds in favor of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

private respondent's claim must remain subordinate to the petitioner bank's
title over the property evidenced by TCT No. 101864.</p>
