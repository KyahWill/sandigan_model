for Mayor in <span class="SpellE">Marogong</span> during the February 1, 1988

above-entitled cases not being a party therein." The motion theorized that
the act of Vice-Governor <span class="SpellE">Alauya</span> in seeking legal
opinion of the Office of the Provincial Fiscal, and the formulation and
communication of the requested opinion by Fiscals <span class="SpellE">Dumarpa</span>

revised Rules of Court), and is also an unlawful interference with the
processes or proceedings of this Honorable Commission en banc (Sec. 3-c., Rule
71 **) where the above-entitled cases are now pending for decision * *."

<blockquote>"10.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> improper conduct ** causes chaos and confusion
among the National, Provincial, Municipal officials and the general public on
who is really the legal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Marogong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, considering the
conflict of the defendants' legal opinion and the ‘Resolution’ of the COMELEC

the complainant but to public service, particularly the people of <span class="SpellE">Marogong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That defendants are good
lawyers and know very well that resolutions, orders or decisions of this
Honorable Commission can only be reviewed by the Supreme Court as indicated in
Exhibit '2' (legal opinion), and the issuance of the legal opinion is indeed
with evil motive and tainted with malice;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the aforesaid
improper conduct of the defendants if not timely corrected by severely
punishing them in contempt of this Honorable Commission will be establishing a
very bad precedence because such improper conduct amounts to a REVIEW by a

without notice and hearing." Interpreted in consonance with its context,
the statement would appear to charge the respondents with judicial notice of
the cited rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But surely it could not
have been meant to be taken in that sense because the rule of judicial notice
binds only courts acting as such and, moreover, it is doubtful if the precept
referred to is a proper subject of judicial notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One would, however, be hard put to give the
statement any other meaning that would not in one way or another contradict the
ordinary intendment of its language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The respondent Commission
would have it that if need was felt for any clarification in connection with
the proclamation and the Resolution in question, it should have been sought
with said Commission itself since the petitioners knew, or should have known,
that it has exclusive jurisdiction over pre-proclamation controversies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It fails to explain, however, how the Acting
Governor could have done this, not being a party to that particular
controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even had that step been
feasible, it does not appear that said respondent has jurisdiction to render an
advisory opinion or declaratory judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The power to hold in
contempt, it has time and again been held, must be exercised, not on the
vindictive, but on the preservative principle.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

Commission and failed to conform to its own views.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judicial sensibilities should not become too
tender or self-protective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All things
considered, the contempt ruling here cannot be justified on the preservative
principle, there being no clear showing, either in the terms of the allegedly
contumacious opinion or from the circumstances that led to its issuance, of any
intent to denigrate the authority of the respondent Commission or erode the
faith and respect due its decisions, orders or other actuations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said ruling is, therefore, REVERSED and SET
ASIDE, and petitioners are absolved of the contempt charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
