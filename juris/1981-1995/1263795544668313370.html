<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as found by respondent Appellate Court, are

dated March 2, 1917.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime </span><span>in </span><span>1917, a 
portion of said lot 86 was sold by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> to 
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span>, defendants' father.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After the sale, Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span> took 
possession of the portion of 
</span><st1:place><span>Lot</span></st1:place><span> 86 sold, and constructed a 
residential house thereon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime </span><span>in

taxation the portion of Lot 86 occupied by him consisting of 1,023 square meters

'just before the war disappeared and was never heard from up to the present and 
is therefore presumed dead x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x' per Exhibit

the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Delfina</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Dalman</span> executed a 'Deed of Extrajudicial partition and 
confirmation of Previous Sale' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 14) whereby, the 
½ <em>pro-indiviso</em> share of <span class="SpellE">Simplicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagsican</span> in Lot Nos. 86 and 9 as well as the interest of

<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It appears that some of the heirs of 
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> conveyed their 1/9 share in Lot No. 86 
pertaining to the share of the late father.<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="12" day="21" year="1970"><span>December 21, 1970</span></st1:date><span>, 
the abovementioned heirs of the deceased Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> 
executed an 'Extrajudicial Settlement of Estate of Deceased Person with

children in 1/9 share each, except <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> who had acquired the 1/9 share of his mother and was 
given 2/9 share; and thereafter, taking cognizance of the various conveyances 
made by some of the heirs in favor of <span class="SpellE">Vibesa</span> <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> married to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Cimafranca</span> declared the latter the owner of 7/9 share of ¾

their residential building and fence, as well as damages (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 51).<span>&nbsp; </span>Said complaint was

Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 9).<span>&nbsp; </span>In a 
resolution of the Second Division dated January 23, 1985, the Court resolved to 
require the respondents to comment on the petition (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 126) which comment was filed by 
respondents on March 8, 1985 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p.

<p class="BODY">On September 25, 1985, the Court, through the Second Division, 
resolved to give due course to the petition and to require the parties to submit 
their respective memoranda within twenty (20) days from notice (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 141).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed 
their memorandum on December 2, 1985 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>,

APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THIS HONORABLE TRIBUNAL.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">The trial court found that TCT No. T-4569 issued in the names of 
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span>, ¾ share and Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span>, &amp;fract14; share based on the deed of partition 
executed by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> and his co-heirs on October 
6, 1958 (Entry No. 7899) which is purely self-serving, is a patent nullity 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 78, par. 20); the deed of 
extrajudicial partition of Lot 86 was effected without the consent of defendants 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 80).<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent 
Court paraphrased the ruling, as follows:<span>&nbsp; </span>"Plaintiffs cannot avail 
of the extrajudicial partition which was executed in 1958 without the knowledge 
and participation of the defendants and <span>in </span>fraud of defendants' 
rights and interest over Lot No. 86 which document became the basis for the 
issuance of TCT No. T-4569 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A), 
as an excuse to avoid the consequences of their own unjustified inaction and as 
a basis for the assertion of a right on which they have slept for so long" 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 48).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>In other 
words, respondent Court is of the view that TCT No. T-4569 is a patent nullity 
proceeding from the fact that the deed of extrajudicial partition was executed 
without the participation of defendants, and therefore in fraud of their rights 
and interests, and after <span class="SpellE">laches</span> could already be 
invoked against petitioners and their predecessors.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners question this conclusion of respondent Court as not 
being based on any clear and distinct statement of the facts and the law, TCT 
No. T-4569 having become incontrovertible and <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span> by virtue of the lapse not only of four (4) 
but of thirteen (13) long years from its issuance in 1958 before its validity 
was challenged in private respondents' counterclaim filed in 1972; and that 
private respondents are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> or are barred by 
prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> from questioning the validity 
and binding effect of TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-4569 or of the deed of 
partition of 1958 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 155).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the questioned deed of extrajudicial 
partition was executed by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> and the heirs 
of <span class="SpellE">Delfina</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Dalman</span> on 
<st1:date month="3" day="13" year="1958">March 13, 1958</st1:date> whereby 
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 86 was adjudicated to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 9 to the <span class="SpellE">Dalmans</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is equally undisputed that in the 
same document Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> confirmed and ratified the 
sale made by him "many years ago" of one-fourth (&amp;fract14;) interest in Lot 
86 to Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span> and that upon registration of 
the document on October 24, 1958, Original Certificate of Title No. RO-1708 
(6515) for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 86 was cancelled and in lieu thereof TCT 
No. T-4569 was issued in the names of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Gurdiel</span> 
married to <span class="SpellE">Simplicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Adrias</span>, 
¾ share and Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span> married to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lorete</span>, &amp;fract14; 
share (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 41-42).</p>
<p class="BODY">Until 1972 respondents had not questioned the validity of the deed 
of extrajudicial partition in 1958, <span class="GramE">nor</span> the issuance of 
TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-4569 but only as a counterclaim to petitioners' 
complaint for partition <span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
</span><span>62).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not after the lapse of 
fourteen (14) years respondent can still question the v<span>a</span>lidity of 
the deed of extrajudicial partition and subsequently TCT<span> No. </span><span class="GramE">T-4569.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On this issue, the Supreme Court in various cases ruled in the 
negative, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"The action to annul a deed of extrajudicial settlement upon the 
ground of fraud may be filed within four years from the discovery of the 
fraud.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such discovery is deemed to have taken place when said 
instrument was filed with the Register of Deeds and new certificates <span>of 
title were issued in the name of respondents respectively.<span>&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the registration of the deed 
of extra-judicial settlement constitute constructive notice to the whole world."

<p class="BODY">An action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of real 
property on the ground of fraud must be filed within four (4) years from the 
discovery of the fraud.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such discovery is deemed to have taken 
place from the issuance of the certificates of title (<span class="SpellE"><em>Baldin</em></span><em> v. Medalla</em>, 108 SCRA 666).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Respondents had only four years from October, 1958 or until 1962 to bring 
this action, which respondents failed to do.</p>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, the records show that respondents and their predecessors 
can be charged not only with constructive notice but with actual notice of the 
fraud, if any, in 1958, as well.<span>&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by petitioners, 
<span class="SpellE">Librado</span> <span class="SpellE">Balbosa</span>, an employee 
of the Registry <span>of </span>Deeds of <span class="SpellE"><span>Zamboanga</span></span><span>, testified that the person who 
presented the 1958 deed of partition for registration in the Office of the 
Registry of Deeds was the late Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jalosjos</span> 
himself (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 17) and it was respondent 
</span><span class="SpellE"><span>Aracelita</span></span><span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Jalosjos</span></span><span> who received owner's copy of TCT 
No. T-4569 and delivered the copy to her father who was still alive at that time 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 74).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">For <span class="SpellE">laches</span> to attach, the following 
elements must be present:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) Conduct on the part of the defendant 
or one under whom he claims, giving rise to the situation of which complaint is 
made and for which the complainant seeks remedy; (2) Delay in asserting the 
complainant's right, the complainant having had knowledge or notice of the 
defendant's conduct and having<span> been afforded an opportunity to institute a 
suit; (3) Lack of knowledge or notice on the part of the defendant that the 
complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and (4) Injury or 
prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant, 
or the suit is not held to be barred (<em>De Lucas v. Gamponia</em>, 100 Phil.

<p class="BODY">Respondents have not taken any step to have the deed of 
extrajudicial partition corrected, if it is true as they claim it is, that what 
had been sold to their father is ¾ share <span>of </span>Lot 86 instead of 
&amp;fract14; share.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It is </span>now both too late and 
bereft of basis to ask for the cancellation of TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-4569.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Inaction and neglect of a party to 
assert <span>a </span>right can convert a valid claim into a stale demand 
(<em>Perez v. Ong Chua</em>, 116 SCRA 732 [1982]).<span>&nbsp; </span>An <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE">laches</span> arises from the 
negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time, warranting a 
presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned it or 
declined to assert it (Municipality of <span class="SpellE"><em>Carcar</em></span><em> v. CFI of Cebu</em>, <span class="SpellE">Barile</span> Branch, 119 SCRA 392 [1982]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Gumpin</em></span><em> v. Court of Appeals</em>, 120 SCRA 687 
[1983]; <em>Guerrero v. Court of Appeals</em>, 126 SCRA 109 [1983]; <em>De 
Castro v. Tan</em>, 129 SCRA 85 [1984]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Medija</em></span><em> v. Patcho</em>, 132 SCRA 540 [1984]; 
<em>Burgos v. Chief of Staff of the Phil.</em>, 133 SCRA 800 [1984]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Corro</em></span><em> v. Lising</em>, 137 SCRA 541 [1985]; 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Tejido</em></span><em> v. Zamacoma</em>, 138 SCRA 78 
[1985]).</p>
<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, as things turned out, the lower court found 
petitioners guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> as respondents had 
already been in possession of ¾ portion of the lot for the last fifty-four (54) 
years before they filed their complaint in 1971 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 80) which conclusion was sustained by 
respondent Appellate Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
46).<span>&nbsp; </span>Such conclusion is untenable even for the sake of argument 
for <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 86 is registered land and registered lands are 
not subject to prescription.<span>&nbsp; </span>Adverse, notorious and continuous 
possession under a claim of ownership for the period fixed by law is ineffective 
against a Torrens Title (<span class="SpellE"><em>Bolanos</em></span><em> v. J.M. 
Tuason</em> <em>&amp; Co.</em>, Inc., 37 SCRA 223 [1971]; <em>Republic v. 
Lichauco</em>, 46 SCRA 305 [<span>1972]; <em>Spouses Co v. Serafin</em>, 121 
SCRA 61 [1982]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Mendiola</em></span><em> v. Court of 
Appeals</em>, 106 SCRA 130 [1981]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Umbay</em></span><em> 
v. Alecha</em>, 135 SCRA 427 [1985]).<span>&nbsp; </span>Unless there are intervening 
rights of third persons which may be affected or prejudiced by a decision 
directing the return of the lot to petitioners, the equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> will not apply as against the registered owners 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Urbano</em></span><em> v. Concepcion</em>, 94 SCRA 212 
[1979]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent Court relied on the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Arcuino</em></span><em> v. Agaris</em> (22 SCRA 407 [1962]) 
where the Court ruled in favor of defendants and their predecessors-in-interest, 
they having been in possession of the lot in litigation, for 26 years.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Plaintiffs had sought to recover the lot in an action for recovery of 
possession, damages and legal redemption, alleging their co-ownership over the 
land to the extent of ¾ thereof.</p>
<p class="BODY">It will be observed, however, that there is hardly any similarity 
between said case and the case at bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the former, the Court 
ruled that plaintiffs were not registered owners.<span>&nbsp; </span>They merely 
claimed to have acquired, by succession their alleged title or interest in Lot 
No. 355.<span>&nbsp; </span>At any rate, plaintiffs therein were guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span>the other hand, in the present case, a Torrens 
Title is involved, and this Title gives petitioners ¾, and respondents only ¼ of 
the land.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nor are petitioners guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, the respondents' claim having been made only after a 
survey made of the land in 1972.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In fact, petitioners' claim that it is private 
respondents themselves who are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> or are 
barred by prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> from questioning 
<span>the </span>validity and binding effect of TCT No.</span> T-4569 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 17) is well taken under the circumstances 
considering particularly the time that has elapsed since the issuance of the 
pertinent Torrens Title.<span>&nbsp; </span>Besides, a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> 
title cannot be attacked collaterally.<span>&nbsp; </span>The issue on its validity 
can be raised only in an action expressly instituted for that purpose (<span class="SpellE"><em>Magay</em></span><em> v. Estiandan</em>, 69 SCRA 456 [1976]; 
<em>Barrios v. Court of Appeals</em>, 78 SCRA 427 [1977]).<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
efficacy and integrity of the Torrens System must be protected (<em>Director of 
Lands v. Court of Appeals</em>, 102 SCRA 130 [1981]).</p>
