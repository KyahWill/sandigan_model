				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Once again, this Court is tasked with determining whether the
contract entered into by the parties constitutes an absolute sale or merely an
equitable mortgage in this present appeal by <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of
the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners seek the
reversal of the decision of the public respondent Court of Appeals which
affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of the
trial court declaring the Deed of Absolute Sale as null and void and finding
the contract to be in truth an equitable mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case, as found by the trial court,
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedronia</span> were the
registered owners of the property in question containing an area of 2,221.86
square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property had been
planted to rice for sometime by defendants <span class="SpellE">Nazareths</span>
under a tenancy agreement with <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span>, predecessor-in-interest of defendant <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 1, 1971
defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pedronia</span>
executed a deed of sale over the said property in favor of spouses <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Santos (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A’) for the sum of P22<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Upon the issuance of a new
title (TCT No. 313883) in the name of vendees (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
'F'), the amount of P16<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was delivered to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Simultaneous with the execution of the deed of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> ‘A), an instrument entitled Promise To Sell
dated February 1, 1971 was executed by the spouses Santos in favor of
defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span>, whereby the former promised to
sell back the land in question to the latter for P22,000.00 within a period of
six months from February 1, 1971 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"4").<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span> failed to exercise the right to repurchase the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1971</st1:date> spouses <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
executed a deed of absolute sale covering the property in question in favor of
their daughter <span class="SpellE">Felicitacion</span> for P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
on <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1971</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '5)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On</span> the same date, <span class="SpellE">Felicitacion</span> and
Gregorio Santos executed a promise to sell the property in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span> for P30,000.00 within six months.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Notwithstanding</span>,
the sale of the property to the <span class="SpellE">Santoses</span>, spouses <span class="SpellE">Ferrera</span> continued in possession of the property thru their
tenants, the <span class="SpellE">Nazareths</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Santoses</span>
informed the <span class="SpellE">Nazareths</span> that they are the new owners
of the property in question and required the latter to pay the rent for the
property in question to them but the <span class="SpellE">Nazareths</span>
refused to recognize them as the owner of the property and continued to deliver
the harvest shares to the <span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Records, p. 223)” (pp. 4-5, Decision; pp.
86-87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="8">August
 17, 1977</st1:date>, or nearly seven (7) years after, plaintiffs, through
their attorney-in-fact, <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Santos, filed an
action for breach of warranty and damages against the defendants based on the
alleged Deed of Absolute Sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defendants argue that they never intended to sell their land for such an
inadequate price; that they were in dire need of money so they obtained the
loan of P22,000.00; that to secure payment of the loan, defendants were
required to execute a Deed of <span class="SpellE">Absoute</span> Sale over the
property in dispute, with the agreement, that the deed of sale will merely
serve as collateral; that they remain in possession of the land; and that the
transfer certificate of title in favor of <span class="SpellE">Apolonia</span>
Santos is null and void, the real contract <span class="GramE">between</span> the
parties being one of equitable mortgage only.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court dismissed the complaint, declaring the
transaction as an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
quote:</p>

<blockquote>"Insofar as the price of the property in the deed of absolute
sale is concerned, there is evidence that the same is unusually
inadequate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
original deed of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> ‘A') provides that
the property in question was sold for P22<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
although only P16,000.00 thereof was actually received by defendant <span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, there is evidence that the land in question would command a price
of P50.00 to P100.00 per square meters, or from P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to P200,000.00 for the entire parcel at the time of the transaction in 1971,
considering the location thereof at <span class="SpellE">Caniogan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, which is within the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> or town proper of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the second place, the <span class="GramE">vendor (defendants
<span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span>) have</span> remained in possession of the
property up to the present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
admitted by plaintiff who would only want defendants to recognize her as the
new owner and to pay the accrued and accruing rentals to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span>,
however, insist that they are the owner and not mere lessees of the land in
question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the third place, there is evidence also that after the
expiration of the six-month period given to defendants to repurchase the
property a new deed of sale was executed by the transferee in favor of
defendants giving the latter another six months to repurchase the land in
question (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘<span class="GramE">6’).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, except for the execution of the deed of sale in
question (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. '</span>A'), it may
be clearly inferred from the circumstances that the intention of the parties is
that the transaction in question was to secure the payment of the amount of
P16,000.00 originally extended to and received by the defendants <span class="SpellE">Ferreras</span> by way of loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These are clearly indicative of the fact that the transaction in
question was in reality an equitable mortgage." <span class="GramE">"(Records,
pp. 224-225)”.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 5-6, Decision; pp. 87-88, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> decision was brought on
appeal to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding
the conclusions of the trial court to be supported by evidence, the respondent
appellate court affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the
questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration having been denied, plaintiff, now
petitioner, filed the instant appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the required pleadings were submitted
by the respective parties, this Court resolved to give due course to the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue presented before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
for review is whether the transaction between the parties constitutes an
absolute sale or only an equitable mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case calls for an interpretation of the contract
between the contending parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
Article 1370 of the New Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If the terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon
the intention of the contracting parties, the literal meaning of its
stipulations shall control.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention
of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1371 of the same code further states:</p>

<blockquote>"In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties
their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally
considered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the terms of the transaction in question do
not plainly and distinctly indicate the intention of the contracting parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since such intention cannot be discerned from
the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the parties, their contemporaneous and
subsequent act shall be taken into consideration to be able to determine their
true intention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an undisputed fact that respondent spouses were "in
dire need of money" to settle certain obligations when they entered into
the subject transaction with the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They entered into a loan agreement but were however made to execute a
Deed of Absolute Sale for the amount of P22<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneous with the execution of the said
document, petitioners executed a separate document, which is the Promise to <span class="GramE">Sell</span> for the same amount of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the time the Deed of Absolute Sale was
executed up to the time the action was instituted in court, respondent spouses
continued to remain in actual physical possession of the land in dispute,
through their tenants (<span class="SpellE">Nazareths</span>) who were also made
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The existence of this
tenancy relationship between the respondents was also admitted by the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the
parties, the trial court found that the contract in issue could not be deemed
to be an absolute sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with
the trial court's findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The acts of
the parties indicate the presence of an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Equitable mortgage has been defined</u> as
"one in which although lacking in some formality, form or words, or other
requisites demanded by a statute nevertheless reveals the intention of the
parties to charge a real property as security for a debt, and contains nothing
impossible or contrary to law" (41 Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>
303).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The applicable law, as found in
the New Civil Code, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1602.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage, <u>in</u> <u>any</u> of
the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When</span>
the price of a sale with right to purchase is unusually inadequate;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the vendor
remains in possession as lessee or otherwise;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When upon or
after the expiration of the right to repurchase another instrument extending
the period of redemption or granting a new period is executed;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the purchaser
retains for himself a part of the purchase price;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the vendor binds
himself to pay the taxes on the thing sold;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(6)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any other cases
where it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of the parties is that
the transaction shall secure the payment of a debt or the performance of any
other obligation."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Equally important is Article 1604 of the same Code, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1604<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> provisions of article 1602 shall also apply to contract
purporting to be an absolute sale."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, it was found that the lot in question is located within
the town proper of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila, behind the <st1:place><st1:placetype>elementary school</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caniogan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner himself
admitted the fact that the subject lot is within the town proper of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being so, it could thus easily command a much
higher price than P22<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, considering further that
the same measures about 2,221.86 square meters, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion that the price of the lot is
grossly inadequate is well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are
not inclined to disturb the factual findings of the trial court which are
supported by evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case of <span class="SpellE">Labasan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lacuesta</span>, 86 SCRA 16, quoted
the Lord Chancellor in Vernon v. <span class="SpellE">Bethell</span> (2 Eden,
113), which states: "Necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men;
but to answer a present emergency, will submit to any term that the crafty may
impose upon them."</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, it was clearly established that the private
respondents, through their tenant, remained in physical possession of the land
subject matter of the dispute, and enjoyed the fruits thereof despite the
execution of the Deed of Absolute Sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This fact was not disputed by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, this indicates the existence of a
contract of loan with the land given as security.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, the respondent court noted that there had always been an
extension of the period to repurchase arising from the fact that there were two
(2) sets of deed of sale and with a period given to the vendor to repurchase,
as seen from the two (2) sets of Promise to Sell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such fact even maintains the theory than an
absolute sale was never intended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the allegation of the petitioner, the promise to sell
simultaneously executed by the vendee is in truth the right of repurchase
granted the vendor, and is within the contemplation of Art. <span class="GramE">1602,
no. 3 of the New Civil Code.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
support of his claim, petitioner cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, et al., L-19196, Nov. 29, 1968, which ruled that if a
seller has been granted an "option to buy" only (and not a right to
repurchase) within a certain period, the sale is absolute, and cannot be
considered as an equitable mortgage, even if there is an extension of the
period within which to exercise the option.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The cited case is inapplicable to the present one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy to note that the deed of sale in
the <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> case was executed on <st1:date year="1951" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1951</st1:date> and the option to buy on
<st1:date year="1951" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1951</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, however, the promise to
sell was executed on the same day that the deed of sale was executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In like manner, the price of the sale in the
cited case was considered to be sufficiently adequate, whereas in the instant
case it is unusually inadequate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner also cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Felicen</span>,
Sr., et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Orias</span>, 156 SCRA 586, which decreed
that "if there are no circumstances that may reasonably be accepted as
generating some honest doubts as to the parties’ intention, the proviso is inapplicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is quite obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the rule were otherwise, it would be
within the power of every vendor a retro to set at naught a <span class="SpellE">pacto</span>
de retro, or resurrect an expired right of repurchase, by simply instituting an
action to reform the contract - known to him to be in truth a sale with <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro - into an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The rule would thus be made a tool to spawn, protect and
even reward fraud and bad faith, a situation surely never contemplated or
intended by law." We find no resemblance between the cited case and the
instant one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Felicen</span>
case involves only one deed of sale wherein the right to repurchase is already
incorporated therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract could
not be considered a loan, as its terms were so plain and preclude a
construction of some other kind of agreement but one of a sale with <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the circumstances <span class="GramE">attendant in the instant
case are</span> obviously different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
right to repurchase (or the Promise to <span class="GramE">Sell</span>) was
embodied in a separate document which was executed on the same date as the deed
of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful evaluation of the above-stated circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the present case to exhibit several of the familiar
badges of a concealed mortgage enumerated by the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the pertinent law, presence of <u>any</u>
of the circumstances enumerated would be sufficient enough to declare the
transaction of absolute sale as one impressed with an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, there is even more than
one (1) circumstance indicating an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the claim of the petitioner that the
decision of the trial court is not based on the supporting evidentiary facts
and jurisprudence on the matter is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> finding no reversible error in the decision of
the Court of Appeals, the petition for review is DENIED for lack of merit.</p>
