				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">When petitioners informed herein private respondents to stop the
delivery of pulp wood supplied by the latter pursuant to a contract of sale
between them, private respondents sued for breach of their covenant.  The court of origin dismissed the complaint
but at the same time enjoined petitioners to respect the contract of sale if
circumstances warrant the full operation in a commercial scale of petitioners' Baloi
plant and to continue accepting and paying for deliveries of pulp wood products
from Romeo Lluch (page 14, Petition; page 20, Rollo).  On appeal to the then Intermediate, Appellate Court, Presiding
Justice Ramon G. Gaviola, Jr., who spoke for the First Civil Cases Division,
with Justices Caguioa, Quetulio-Losa, and Luciano, concurring, modified the
judgment by directing herein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioners
</span>to pay private respondents, jointly and severally, the sum of P30,000.00
as moral damages and P15,000.00 as attorney's fees (pages 48-58, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition at bar, it is argued that the Appellate Court
erred:</p>

<blockquote>“A.  ... IN HOLDING PERSONALLY LIABLE UNDER THE
CONTRACT OF SALE PETITIONER TANTOCO WHO SIGNED MERELY AS REPRESENTATIVE OF
PETITIONER RUSTAN, AND PETITIONER VERGARA WHO DID NOT SIGN AT ALL;</blockquote>

<blockquote>B. … IN HOLDING THAT
PETITIONER RUSTAN'S DECISION TO SUSPEND TAKING DELIVERY OF PULP WOOD FROM
RESPONDENT LLUCH, WHICH WAS PROMPTED BY SERIOUS AND UNFORESEEN DEFECTS IN THE
MILL, WAS NOT IN THE LAWFUL EXERCISE OF ITS RIGHT UNDER THE CONTRACT OF SALE;
and</blockquote>

<blockquote>C.  ... IN AWARDING MORAL DAMAGES AND
ATTORNEY'S FEES IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD OR BAD FAITH.”</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">(page </span>18, Petition; page 24, Rollo)<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The generative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">facts </span>of
the controversy, as gathered from the pleadings, are fairly simple.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1966, petitioner Rustan established a pulp and paper
mill in Baloi, Lanao del Norte.  On
March 20, 1967, respondent Lluch, who is a holder of a forest products license,
transmitted a letter to petitioner Rustan for the supply of raw materials by
the former to the latter.  In response thereto,
petitioner Rustan proposed, among other things, in the letter-reply:</p>

<blockquote>“2.  That the contract to supply is not exclusive
because Rustan shall have the option to buy from other suppliers who are
qualified and holder of appropriate government authority or license to sell and
dispose pulp wood.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These prefatory business proposals culminated in the execution,
during the month of April, 1968, of a contract of sale whereby Romeo A. Lluch
agreed to sell, and Rustan Pulp and Paper <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mill,
Inc. undertook </span>to pay the price of P30.00 per cubic meter of pulp wood
raw materials to be delivered at the buyer's plant in Baloi, Lanao del
Norte.  Of pertinent significance to the
issue at hand are the following stipulations in the bilateral undertaking:</p>

<blockquote>“3.  That BUYER shall have the option to buy from
other SELLERS who are equally qualified and holders of appopriate government
authority or license to sell or dispose, that BUYER shall not buy from any
other seller whose pulp woods being sold shall have been established to have
emanated from the SELLER'S lumber and/or firewood concession. . . . ”<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>And that SELLER has the priority to supply the pulp wood materials
requirement of the BUYER;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.  That the BUYER shall have the right to ‘stop
delivery of the said raw materials by the seller covered by this contract when
supply of the same shall become sufficient until such time when need for said
raw materials shall have become necessary provided, however, that the SELLER is
given sufficient notice.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pages 8-9, Petition; pages 14-15,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the installation of
the plant facilities, the technical staff of Rustan Pulp and Paper Mills, Inc.
recommended the acceptance of deliveries from other suppliers of the pulp wood
materials for which the corresponding deliveries were made.   But during the test run of the pulp mill, the
machinery line thereat had major defects while deliveries of the raw materials
piled up, which prompted the Japanese supplier of the machinery to recommend
the stoppage of the deliveries.  The
suppliers were informed to stop deliveries and the letter of similar advice
sent by petitioners to private respondents reads</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“September
30, 1968</blockquote>

<blockquote>Iligan Diversified Projects, Inc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Iligan City</blockquote>

<blockquote>Attention: Mr. Romeo A.
Lluch</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dear Mr. Lluch:</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is to inform you that the supply of raw materials to us has
become sufficient and we will not be needing further delivery from you.  As per the terms of our contract, please
stop delivery thirty (30) days from today.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Very truly yours,</blockquote>

<blockquote>RUSTAN PULP AND PAPER MILLS, INC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By:</blockquote>

<blockquote>DR. ROMEO S. VERGARA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Resident Manager”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Romeo Lluch sought to clarify the tenor of the
letter as to whether stoppage of delivery or termination of the contract of
sale was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">intended, but the query was
not answered by </span>petitioners.  This alleged ambiguity notwithstanding, Lluch and the other suppliers
resumed deliveries after the series of talks between Romeo S. Vergara and Romeo
Lluch.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 23, 1969, the complaint for contractual breach was
filed which, as earlier noted, was dismissed.  In the process of discussing the merits of the appeal interposed
therefrom, respondent Court clarified the eleven errors assigned below by
herein petitioners and it seems that petitioners were quite satisfied with the
Appellate Court's <u>in</u> <u>seriatim</u> response since petitioners trimmed
down their discourse before this Court to three basic matters, relative to the
nature of liability, the propriety of the stoppage, and the feasibility of
awarding moral damages including attorney's fees.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court found it ironic that petitioners had to exercise
the prerogative regarding the stoppage of deliveries <u>via</u> the letter
addressed to Iligan Diversified Projects, Inc. on September 30, 1968 because
petitioners never really stopped accepting deliveries from private respondents
until December 23, 1968.  Petitioners'
paradoxical stance was portrayed in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . We cannot accept the reasons given by appellees as to why
they were stopping deliveries of pulp wood materials.  <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">First</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, </span>We find it preposterous for a
business company like the appellee to accumulate stockpiles of cut wood even
after its letter to appellants dated September 30, 1968 stopping the deliveries
because the supply of raw materials has become sufficient.  The fact that appellees were buying and
accepting pulp wood materials from other sources other than the appellants even
after September 30, 1968 belies that they have more than sufficient supply of
pulp wood materials, or that they are unable to go into full commercial
operation or that their machineries are defective or even that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pulp </span>wood materials coming from
appellants are sub-standard.  <u>Second</u>,
We likewise find the court <u>a</u> <u>quo's</u> finding that “even with one
predicament in which defendant Rustan found itself wherein commercial operation
was delayed, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">accommodated all its
suppliers of raw materials, including plaintiff, Romeo Lluch, </span>by
allowing them to deliver all its stockpiles of cut wood” (Decision, page 202,
Record on Appeal) to be both illogical and inconsistent.  Illogical, because as appellee Rustan itself
claimed “if the plant could not be operated on a commercial scale, it would
then be illogical for defendant Rustan to continue accepting deliveries of raw
materials.”  Inconsistent because this
kind of “concern” or “accommodation” is not usual or consistent with ordinary
business practice considering that this would mean adequate losses to the
company.  More so, if We consider that
appellee is a new company and could not therefore afford to absorb more losses
than it already allegedly incurred by the consequent defects in the
machineries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Clearly therefore, this is a breach of the contract entered into by
and between appellees and appellants which warrants the intervention of this
Court.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . The letter of September 30, 1968, Exh. “D” shows that
defendants were terminating the contract of sale (Exh. “A”), and refusing any
future or further delivery --- whether on the ground that they had sufficient
supply of pulp wood materials or that appellants cannot meet the standard of
quality of pulp wood materials that Rustan needs or that there were defects in
appellees’ machineries resulting in an inability to continue full commercial
operations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, there is evidence on record that appellees have been
accepting deliveries of pulp wood materials from other sources, i.e. Salem
Usman, Fermin Villanueva and Pacasum even after September 30, 1968.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Lastly, it would be unjust for the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> to rule that the contract of sale be temporarily
suspended until Rustan, et al., are ready <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">t</span>o
accept deliveries from appellants.  This
would make the resumption of the contract purely dependent on the will of one
party --- the appellees, and they could always claim, as they did in the
instant case, that they have more than sufficient supply of pulp wood when in
fact they have been accepting the same from other sources.  Added to this, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
was imposing a new condition in the contract, one that was not agreed upon by
the parties.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Pages 8-10, Decision;
Pages 55-57, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The matter of Tantoco's and Vergara's joint and several liability
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>a result of the alleged breach
of the contract is dependent, first of all, on whether Rustan Pulp and Paper
Mills may legally exercise the right of stoppage should there be a glut of raw
materials at its plant.</p>

<p class="BODY">And insofar as the express discretion on the part of petitioners
is concerned regarding the right of stoppage, We feel that there is cogent
basis for private respondents' apprehension on the illusory resumption of
deliveries inasmuch as the prerogative suggests a condition solely dependent
upon the will of petitioners.  Petitioners can stop delivery of pulp wood from private respondents if
the supply at the plant is sufficient as ascertained by petitioners, subject to
re-delivery when the need arises as determined likewise by petitioners.  This is Our simple understanding of the
literal import of paragraph 7 of the obligation in question.  A purely potestative imposition of this
character must be obliterated from the face of the contract without affecting
the rest of the stipulations considering that the condition relates to the
fulfillment of an already existing obligation and not to its inception (Civil
Code Annotated, by <u>Padilla</u>, 1987 Edition, Volume 4, Page 160).  It is, of course, a truism in legal
jurisprudence that a condition which is both potestative (or facultative) and
resolutory may be valid, even though the saving clause is left to the will of
the obligor like what this Court, through Justice Street, said in <u>Taylor</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Uy</u> <u>Tieng</u> <u>Piao</u> <u>and</u> <u>Tan</u> <u>Liuan</u>
(43 Phil. 873; 879; cited in Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code,
by <u>Tolentino</u>, Volume 4, 1991 edition, page 152).  But the conclusion drawn from the Taylor
case, which allowed a condition for unilateral cancellation of the contract when
the machinery to be installed on the factory did not arrive in Manila, is
certainly inappropriate for application to the case at hand because the factual
milieu in the legal tussle dissected by Justice Street conveys that the <u>proviso</u>
relates to the birth of the undertaking and not to the fulfillment of an
existing obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the second ground for allowance of the petition,
petitioners are of the impression that the letter dated September 30, 1968 sent
to private respondents is well within the right of stoppage guaranteed to them
by paragraph 7 of the contract of sale which was construed by petitioners to be
a temporary suspension of deliveries.  There is no doubt that the contract speaks loudly about petitioners'
prerogative but what diminishes the legal efficacy of such right is the
condition attached to it which, as aforesaid, is dependent exclusively on their
will for which reason, We have no alternative but to treat the controversial
stipulation as inoperative (<u>Article</u> <u>1306</u>, New Civil Code).  It is for this same reason that We are not
inclined to follow the interpretation of petitioners that the suspension of
delivery was merely temporary since the nature of the suspension itself is again
conditioned upon petitioners' determination of the sufficiency of supplies at
the plant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Neither are We prepared
to accept petitioners' exculpation grounded on frustration of the commercial
object under Article 1267 of the New Civil Code, because petitioners continued
accepting deliveries from the suppliers.  This conduct will estop petitioners from claiming that the breakdown of
the machinery line was an extraordinary obstacle to their compliance to the
prestation.  It was indeed incongruous
for petitioners to have sent the letters calling for suspension and yet, they
in effect disregarded their own advice by accepting the deliveries from the
suppliers.  The demeanor of petitioners
along this line was sought to be justified as an act of generous accommodation,
which entailed greater loss to them and “was not motivated by the usual
businessman's obsession with profit” (Page 34, Petition; Page 40, Rollo).  Altruism may be a noble gesture but
petitioners' stance in this respect hardly inspires belief for such an excuse
is inconsistent with a normal business enterprise which takes ordinary care of
its concern in cutting down on expenses (<u>Section</u> <u>3</u>, (<u>d</u>), <u>Rule</u>
<u>131</u>, Revised Rules of Court).  Knowing fully well that they will encounter difficulty in producing
output because of the defective machinery line, petitioners opted to open the
plant to greater loss, thus compounding the costs by accepting additional
supply to the stockpile.  Verily, the
Appellate Court emphasized the absurdity of petitioners' action when they
acknowledged that “if the plant could not be operated on a commercial scale, it
would then be illogical for defendant Rustan to continue accepting deliveries
of raw materials.” (Page 202, Record on Appeal; Page 8, Decision; Page 55,
Rollo).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue next that Tantoco and Vergara should not have
been adjudged to pay moral damages and attorney's fees because Tantoco merely
represented the interest of Rustan Pulp and Paper Mills, Inc. while <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Romeo S. Vergara was not privy to the
contract of sale.  On this score, We
have </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agree with petitioners' citation of authority
to the effect that the President and Manager of a corporation who entered into
and signed a contract in his official capacity, cannot be made liable
thereunder in his individual capacity in the absence of stipulation to that
effect due to the personality of the corporation being separate and distinct
from the persons composing it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(<u>Bangue</u>
<u>Generale</u> <u>Belge</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Walter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>Bull</u> <u>and</u>
<u>Co</u>., </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Inc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">., 84 Phil. 164).  And because of this precept, Vergara's supposed non­-</span>participation
in the contract of sale although he signed the letter dated September 30, 1968
is completely immaterial.  The two
exceptions contemplated by Article 1897 of the New Civil Code where agents are
directly responsible are absent and wanting.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED
in the sense that only petitioner Rustan Pulp and Paper Mills is ordered to pay
moral damages and attorney's fees as awarded by respondent Court.</p>
