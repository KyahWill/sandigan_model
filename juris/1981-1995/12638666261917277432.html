<p class="BODY">UST had not been previously paying its faculty members 13th month
pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree No. 851, which
took effect on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1975</st1:date>
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 1.</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
employers are hereby required to pay all their employees receiving a basic
salary of not more than P1,000 a month, regardless of the nature of the
employment, a 13th month pay not later than December 24 of every year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 2.</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Employers
already paying their employees a 13th month pay or its equivalent are not
covered by this Decree.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, since the faculty members of UST
were receiving salaries greater than P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a
month, UST was not required to pay them any 13th month pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1986</st1:date>,
President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> issued Memorandum Order No. 28 which
provided:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Section 1 of Presidential
Decree No. 851 is hereby modified to the extent that all employers are hereby
required <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">to </span>pay all their
rank-and-file employees a 13th month pay not later than December 24 of every
year.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus starting with the year 1986 the UST was required by law to
pay its faculty members the 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time the faculty expected compliance with the Agreement of <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1985</st1:date> to pay Christmas gifts
of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for full-time faculty members and
P1,000.00 for part-time faculty members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was because of this that the controversy arose.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1986</st1:date>,
Prof. <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> wrote a letter to the rector of the
university expressing the faculty members’ apprehensions regarding reports
“that the 13th month pay is being reduced by deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
the amount of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">said </span>Christmas
gift.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The rector replied the next day, <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1986</st1:date>, by attaching a memorandum of its legal
counsel which concluded that “the Christmas bonus already paid to the employees
shall be credited as compliance with the 13th month pay.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span>December 9,
1986, Prof. <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> wrote the rector another letter
expressing the union’s disagreement with the university legal counsel’s opinion
and reiterating its position that the Christmas gift is not a bonus and should
be paid in addition to the 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The letter further stated:</p>

<blockquote>It will be recalled that when you and Fr. <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span>,
and I - in the presence of Alex <span class="SpellE">Tagaro</span> - met at the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Sports Club in March, 1985 and discussed
possible settlement of our then existing labor dispute in the University, it
was readily agreed that the University would pay the faculty members the
aggregate amount of P35 million demanded by the Union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only thereafter that we proceeded, in
a subsequent meeting held in the same place, to take up the matter of
allocation, that is, how the sum of P35 million would be paid and what
form.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">As </span>finally agreed, the payment in cash would be made over a period
of three (3) years in the form of salary increases, increase of contribution to
the Retirement Fund, Christmas gift, hospitalization benefits, and educational
benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All this embodied in our
Agreement dated <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1985</st1:date>
which is part and parcel (Annex “A”) of our CBA dated <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>our agreement
that the University’s obligation was to pay the faculty members the total
amount of P35 million - no more, no less - (see par. 1.0 of the March 25
Agreement) that it is expressly and explicitly stipulated therein that at the
end of School Year 1987-88 there should be any unspent balance of the aggregate
P35<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>, such unspent balance shall be
distributed proportionately to all faculty members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See par. 6.0.)</span> The
allocation was not intended to affect in any way the obligation of the
University to pay P35 million, no part of which should therefore be considered
as a bonus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">When UST did not heed the union’s demand, the latter filed a
complaint with the arbitration branch of the NLRC on <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1986</st1:date> seeking to compel UST to pay
the faculty members the full amount of their 13th month pay and not to deduct <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> or
P1,000.00 given as Christmas gift.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">January 4, </span>1989</st1:date>, the Labor
Arbiter rendered a decision dismissing the union’s complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arbiter ruled that the Christmas gift <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may </span>be considered an equivalent of the
13th month pay pursuant to the rules implementing P.D. No. 851.</p>

<p class="BODY">The union appealed to the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="8">August 23,

reconsideration but this was denied on <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="9">September
 29, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the issue was ventilated not only before the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Individual faculty members filed complaints
before the Grievance Adjudication Committee created pursuant to the CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a unanimous decision dated March 27, 1987,
the Committee ruled “that the P2<span class="GramE">,000</span>/1,000 provided
for in Sec. 2.3 of Annex “A” of the CBA is not a Christmas Bonus creditable to
the 13th month pay but part of the P35 million which in the Compromise
Agreement (Annex “A” of CBA) was agreed upon by the Faculty Union and the
respondent University as a settlement of all existing claims of the Union.” <span class="GramE">[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 86.]</span> The decision was

Prof. Ma. <span class="GramE">Melvyn P. <span class="SpellE">Alamis</span>,

“Christmas bonus,” “milling bonus” and “amelioration bonus,” the yearly total
of which exceeds one month salary, may be considered as an “equivalent” of the
13th month pay under the rules implementing P.D. No. 851, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>The evident intention of the law, as revealed by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">law </span>itself, was to grant an additional

equivalent - whether out of pure generosity or on the basis of a binding
agreement and, in the latter case, regardless of the conditional character of
the grant (such as making the payment dependent on profit), so long as there is
actual payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, what was
conceived to be a 13th month salary would in effect become a 14th or possibly
15th month <span class="GramE">pay.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“The term ‘its equivalent’ . . . shall include Christmas bonus,
mid-year bonus, profit-sharing payments and other cash bonuses amounting to not

by the employee, as well as non-monetary benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where an employer pays less than 1/12th of

both voluntary and contractual bonuses for the purpose of determining liability
for the 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To require
employers (already giving their employees a 13th month salary or its
equivalent) to give a second 13th month pay would be unfair and productive of
undesirable results.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the employer who

</span>When, therefore, petitioner, in order to comply with the mandate of PD
No. 851, credited the year-end productivity bonus as part of the 13th month pay

exempts from the payment of the 13th month pay employers who are already giving
its equivalent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise the goal of
uniformly providing employees with additional income will not be met.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another inequity will result:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>while most employees will be paid thirteen
(13) months salary, some, by virtue of P.D. No. 851, will be receiving salary
for fourteen (14) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">The imposition of a “double burden” does not obtain in the
present case even if UST <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pays </span>both
the 13th month pay and the Christmas gift of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

to the faculty members within the time frame and in the forms specified in the
agreement, its obligation to pay a Christmas gift of P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
or P1,000.00, as part of the P35M compromise package, ceases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>UST would then have to comply only with P.D.
No. 851 as amended by Memorandum Order No. 28 by paying the 13th month pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Christmas gift is clearly not an “equivalent” of the 13th
month pay under the rules implementing P.D. No. 851.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not akin to a “Christmas bonus,”
“mid-year bonus,” “profit-sharing payments” or “other cash bonuses.” <span class="GramE">[Sec. 3.]</span></p>

<blockquote>[A] <span class="GramE">bonus</span> is an amount granted and paid to
an employee for his industry and loyalty which contributed to the success of
the employer’s business and made possible the realization of profits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an act of generosity of the employer .
. .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also granted by an enlightened

<p class="BODY">The Christmas gift cannot therefore be compared to the “Christmas
bonus,” “milling bonus,” and “amelioration bonus” in <u>National</u> <u>Federation</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Sugar</u> <u>Workers</u> <u>(NFSW),</u> the “year-end productivity
bonus” in <u>Dole</u>, and the “Christmas bonus” in <span class="SpellE"><u>Brokenshire</u></span>
which were actually forms of incentives and additional income for the
employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it in the same

equivalent to the 13th month pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span><u>FEU</u>

<p class="BODY">We are not saying that these cases are no longer good law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What we are saying is that the facts and
circumstances in the case now before us are at variance with those in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> cases and, hence, do not call for a disposition
similar to that in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">said </span>cases.</p>

<u>Workers</u> <u>Union</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Valenzuela</u>, G.R. No. 70763, April
30, 1987, 149 SCRA 424, we ruled that an employer still has to give the 13th
month pay under P.D. No. 851 on top of the Christmas bonus in graduated
amounts, based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on length </span>of
service, provided in the CBA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said
case, the Court distilled from the facts and circumstances the conclusion that
the purpose of the bonus was to reward employees for their length of service, a
purpose different from that in P.D. No. 851 which seeks to uniformly provide
low-paid employees additional income.</p>
