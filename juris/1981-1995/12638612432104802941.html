the wife of one of his men in the presence of his aide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Ando, Jr., was
then a captain of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) being the supply
officer and superior of Cpl. Ricardo Villanueva of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
of the 3rd Infantry Division at <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <st1:place>Northern
 <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1985</st1:date>
while he and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span>
were on their way from <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> to attend a seminar at
RUCA <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
they arrived in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> late in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ando informed Villanueva that they may have
to stay overnight in Villanueva's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He handed him a P10.00 bill for viand and supper and left their luggage
as they proceeded to the bus terminal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon verifying that there was no more transportation for <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
they returned to the Villanueva residence at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Matobato</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were
received by Martina Villanueva, the wife of Villanueva.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Villanueva was not in the house
as he was in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Trinidad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ando removed his trousers in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> in front of Martina who turned away and went to the
kitchen to set the table for the supper of their guests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> ate
supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Martina was attending to <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span>, Ando went to her and suddenly held her hands,
twisting them behind her and then with his left hand holding a piece of cotton
with a strong-<span class="SpellE">odored</span> substance, covered her mouth and
nose and forcibly dragged and pulled her towards the bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surprised, she struggled to free herself
notwithstanding her small and frail constitution as compared to Ando who was
robust, big and strong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon noticing
the commotion, <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> admonished Ando three times to
refrain from disgracing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Martina
felt weak and dizzy after smelling the cotton.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ando pushed her to the bed and removed her panty forcibly snapping its
waistband and tearing it at its seam.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then he threatened her with death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Due to the threat to her life, she was seized with fear and she
trembled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was not able to shout and
make a sound or resist further.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
Ando removed his brief, placed himself on top of her, inserted his finger into
her genital and later had sexual intercourse with her against her will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were unnaturally positioned across the
bed when he inserted his penis into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After he finished ravishing her for the first time, Ando <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">wiped her genital organ with the bed
spread.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he again inserted his
penis into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, upon
hearing the sound of a motorcycle going towards the house, he told her to dress
up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was weak and could hardly move
so he dressed her up himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
threatened her again with death, including her children in the threat, should
she tell her husband what happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> who was present then attested that
the accused forcibly dragged and pulled Martina towards the bedroom and later
had carnal knowledge with her despite his admonitions not to do so; that the
accused got angry with him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>continued
with his lustful attack against her; that <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> could
not stand the sight of what the accused was doing to Martina, so he did not finish
his supper and stepped out of the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Martina did not immediately reveal her misfortune to her husband
that evening for fear that there might be a bloody confrontation between them
and because of the threats of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only after the accused and <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> left
early in the following morning that Martina revealed everything to her
husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She immediately submitted
herself to a medical examination at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span> General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
wherein Dr. Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, resident physician, found as
follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent:-.5in">"1. Superficial laceration 1"
posterior portion vaginal canal;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Minimal blood coming

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The couple also went to <span class="SpellE">Rawis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> at the Philippine Army headquarters
where they filed a complaint against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, and after a preliminary investigation of the
matter, the complaint for the crime of rape <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">was </span>filed by City Fiscal at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in the Regional Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
same city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After arraignment where the
accused pleaded not guilty and the trial on the merits, a decision was rendered
on October 29, 1987 convicting the accused of the crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>rape committed in the dwelling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>the complainant and sentencing him to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">suffer </span>the penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, </span>to
indemnify the offended party, Mrs. Martina Villanueva, the sum of P12,000.00
and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, the accused now interposed this appeal
to this Court alleging five (5) errors committed by the trial court the
resolution of which revolves on the singular question of the credibility of the
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the appellant contends that the probability of any
copulation is remote considering that (a) at the time, the complainant was in
her menstrual period; (b) the alleged offense was committed in the presence of
a companion of the appellant, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span>; (c) the
alleged sexual congress occurred at the ground floor of the Villanueva
residence where her four children and in-laws were residing and their house was
only one (1) meter distance from that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
</span>Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Cepeda</span> who was then awake and smoking
on the bench by the window; (d) that although Cpl. Villanueva was not at the
house then, the appellant knew he merely delivered two sergeants at their camp
at <span class="SpellE">Sabang</span> and would immediately return to their
residence; (e) that complainant was able to meet her husband upon his arrival
that evening with composure while Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> continued
his dinner in a casual manner; and (f) the medical findings show that the
vaginal smear from the complainant's private parts was free of spermatozoa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not persuaded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it may be true that the complainant was in her menstrual period,
it appears that it did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">deter </span>the
appellant from his bestial desire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the presence of his aide and companion, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span>, did not bother him at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, it even emboldened
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he got mad when <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> tried to dissuade him from pursuing his evil
designs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the appellant lost
all sense of reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All he wanted was
to be able to have carnal knowledge of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of rape it was past <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00
 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The members of the
household including the children of complainant and her in-laws were already
asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the threat to kill
her in addition to the fact that the complainant was weakened and felt dizzy
because of what she was made to smell by the appellant, she was not able to
offer any resistance or cry out for help from the members of the household and
the neighborhood.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be likewise be true that the appellant knew that Martina's
husband, Cpl. Villanueva may return any time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, the appellant wanted so much to accomplish his carnal desire
towards Martina even for a fleeting moment or even for "four minutes"
as the appellant computes, until the husband returned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when her husband returned, Martina met
him casually as she was threatened and directed to act normally by the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, she did not want to
immediately reveal her plight to her husband because of the possible grave consequences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the same token, if Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> acted casually by finishing his dinner and going to
bed, thereafter, perhaps he was still making up his mind if he should.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the appellant was his superior
officer and had moral ascendancy over him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the absence of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear of the
private part of the complainant, suffice it to say that the absence thereof
does not necessarily mean that the rape was not consummated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The physical findings of the physician is to
the effect that there were superficial lacerations in the vaginal canal showing
that there was penetration by force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
if there was no spermatozoa that was deposited in the vagina of the
complainant, it must have been because it was expelled by her menstrual flow.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the appellant through his sole testimony is a mere
denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleges that although he was
actually present in the residence of the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span>
on that evening when he went to the room and took off his trousers, Martina
went inside the room and told him that she was fixing his beddings, and that
she apologized that they did not have a clean blanket for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also states that while she was fixing his
bed, he was transferring his bag and pair of shoes to the upper portion of the
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were both facing the wall
close to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He likewise alleges
that he told her about the activities of her husband and to watch out for him
as he heard he was maintaining a woman at <span class="SpellE">Catbalogan</span>
and that he was always out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Martina kept
mum and went out and rested in the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">sala</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant alleges that the motive of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Villanuevas</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> in </span>fabricating the case against him
was because way back in 1983 he recommended that Cpl. Villanueva be prosecuted
for selling firearms and ammunition but the case was dropped as there was no
sufficient evidence; that when he assumed office as supply officer, he
abolished the gasoline allowance for the motorcycle of Villanueva and he did
not supply him with combat shoes so that he was bitter about this; and that he
knew of the plans of Villanueva to smuggle out arms and ammunition but he did
not inform him about it but the case against Villanueva was dropped as the real
culprit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>prosecuted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not convinced that there was any ill motive on the
part of the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span> in prosecuting the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If indeed the appellant knew
that he had wronged the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span> he would not have
even thought of staying overnight in the Villanueva residence on that fateful
evening of August 11, 1985, and if the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span>
have any ax to grind against appellant they would not have extended the
hospitality of their home or attended to the needs of the appellant and <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> in the traditional Filipino hospitality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged ill motive imputed by the
appellant to the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span> is imaginary and
concocted and is far from credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also argues that the alleged force and intimidation
have not been established in evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He claims that the version of the complainant that she was made to smell
drugs by the appellant is false and malicious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a question of which to believe, the positive declaration of the
complainant or the simple denial of the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer is obvious: the positive assertion
should be given more weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course
the appellant claims that Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> did not notice
that the appellant placed cotton on the nose of the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be because the attention of <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> was called only after he heard the commotion when
complainant was being dragged by the appellant towards the bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Fabi</span> affirmed
that he saw the appellant drag the victim to the room is clear evidence of the
use of force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the victim asserted
that her arm was twisted from behind by the appellant who pushed and threatened
her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">so she did not resist any
further.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was cowed into submission
and she was weak and dizzy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of the appellant that the complainant freely and
willingly submitted herself to the sexual act without manifesting dislike is an
unconscious emergence of his ambivalent posture of denying having had sexual
intercourse with the complainant in one breath; and in another, admitting the
coitus but alleging that the complainant freely and willingly submitted herself
to his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the composure of the complainant
immediately after the sexual congress does not betray the falsity of the charge
as contended by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was such
overwhelming fear arising from the threat of the appellant and of a </span>possible
bloody confrontation with her husband that is why she kept mum and did not show
any unusual behavior to her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the judge who penned the decision in this case who was able
to hear only the evidence of the defense and not the prosecution, as it was his
predecessor who heard the evidence of the prosecution, it did not thereby
disqualify him from rendering a decision based on the records and transcript of
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be true that he may not
have the opportunity of personally assessing the credibility of the witnesses
for the prosecution but he had the opportunity to observe the appellant while
testifying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record of the testimony
of the prosecution witnesses can very well be assessed and compared with that
of the appellant in arriving at the verdict.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds and so holds that the presumption of innocence in
favor of the accused has been overturned by evidence beyond reasonable doubt on
the part of the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here is a
case of a superior officer who, taking advantage of his ascendancy over one of
his men and the hospitality of his family ravished his wife even in the
presence of an aide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter was so
scandalized that he mustered the nerve to dissuade him three times against
pursuing his carnal designs but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead the appellant consummated the act not once but twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He desisted only upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the early return </span>of the husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the latter unknowingly continued to shower the appellant his
hospitality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant savored all
of it but early the next morning he left without so much as bidding goodbye or
thanking his hosts.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
