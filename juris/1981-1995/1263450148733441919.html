sexual intercourse with complainant resulting in her giving birth to a child,
whom respondent readily recognized, both complainant and he being free to
marry, she being about 30 years of age and he 28.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, respondent married
complainant's cousin, whom complainant knew respondent had been courting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hereunder is the report and recommendation of

education teacher at the <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City Central
Elementary School, while respondent was also single, 28 years old, and the
private secretary to the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> City.</blockquote>

intercourse at the latter's boarding house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>. pp. 29-30,
82-85).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions after that,
complainant visited respondent at the same boarding house, and there they
savored the sweetness of connubial bliss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, complainant became pregnant, and on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1973</st1:date>, she delivered a
baby-boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent readily
acknowledged being the father of the baby whom he named after him (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>. ibid, pp. 29-32).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent paid the medi<span style="">c</span>al
and hospital expenses of complainant (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 'D' &amp;

complainant's cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This relationship
was known to complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
complainant, at one time <span class="SpellE">JMay</span> 1973) confronted <span class="SpellE">Florminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Buque</span>, and told the
latter to put an end to her relationship with respondent, otherwise,
complainant 'will never stop running after them no matter how even if she will
lose in the case.' Complainant further threatened <span class="SpellE">Florminda</span>
with injuries the 'moment she would meet <span style="">her
any place.' (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span> </span><st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="9"><span style="">September

respondent's love and submitted to his <span class="SpellE">importunings</span>
to have sexual relations due to the latter's promise to marry her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondent, while not
denying their intimate relationship, disclaimed having promised to marry her,
and alleged that their sexual intimacies were motivated by their mutual
attraction and desire for each other.</blockquote>

find for the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Honorable
Court, in <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> <span style="">v. </span>Villanueva, 6 SCRA 811, 895, ruled that:</blockquote>

unprincipled as to warrant disbarment or disciplinary action against the man as
a member of the Bar.'</p>

to complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, complainant
knew before hand that respondent was also engaged to her cousin, <span class="SpellE">Florminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Buque</span>, whom he
eventually married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even if
marriage had entered into the plans of complainant and respondent, we could not
believe that the various occasions in which the parties engaged in sexual
relations were prompted solely by the expectancy on her part that before long
the marital knot would be tied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, complainant was already 30 years old and a public school teacher while
respondent was 28 years old and a private secretary to the City Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, complainant was mature enough to
realize the folly of her acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could
not have been so naive as to be deceived by such promise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly observed by this Honorable Court in
Montana v. <span class="SpellE">Ruado</span>, 62 SCRA 382, which facts are
similar to those of the case at bar, thus:</blockquote>

to the respondent, and that whatever 'injury thus inflicted to the good name
and reputation of complainant x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

that the boarding house of respondent <span style="">had

complainant and respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1973</st1:date>, the time that they

<p class="2Q">'Undoubtedly, the <span class="SpellE">cohabition</span> of
respondent with petitioner is immoral for lack of a valid marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to be the basis of a disciplinary action,
the act must not merely be immoral; it must be 'grossly immoral' - 'it must be <span class="GramE">so</span> corrupt and false as to constitute a criminal act or so
unprincipled as to be reprehensible to a high degree.' (Section 27, Rule 138,
New Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Soberano</span> vs. Villanueva, 6 SCRA
893, 895; <span class="SpellE">Mortel</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Aspiras</span>,

1967, 19 SCRA 439-440, 444-445).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the
same must be established by clear and convincing proof, disclosing a case that
is free from doubt as to compel the exercise by the Court of its disciplinary
power (Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>, October 23, 1967, 21 SCRA 439,
442).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the dubious character of
the act done as well as the motivation thereof must be clearly <span class="GramE">demonstrated</span> (<st1:place>Co.</st1:place> vs. <span class="SpellE">Candoy</span>, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence adduced by petitioner lacks the quantity and quality required by the
foregoing criteria.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'All told, because of petitioner's active and voluntary
participation in her illicit relationship with respondent, the latter's act are

filed this disbarment case not in redress of a wrong, for there was no wrong
