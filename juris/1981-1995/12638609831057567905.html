sustaining stab wounds, he ran towards the municipal building which is about
fifty to one hundred twenty-meter distance from the crime scene near the

rest, including the most fatal wounds, Wounds No. 4 and No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">5, </span>were caused by sharp-edged and

prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the two assigned errors are interrelated, this Court will
discuss them together.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that both the accused killed Hernandez and
would have killed Rosales if not for the timely medical attendance rendered to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While admitting the stabbing, the
two accused claim self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">This claim, however, must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are three requisites to prove the claim of self-defense as
stated in paragraph 1 of Article II of the Revised Penal Code, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of
sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused testified that the victims were the unlawful
aggressors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial
court in not giving credence to the testimonies of the accused as said
testimonies are not only inherently improbable but in conflict with each
other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing of any
injuries sustained by the accused if indeed the victims were the
aggressors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, there is no self-defense
to speak of as the appellants failed to prove that there was unlawful aggression
on the part of the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
the location, number and seriousness of the stab wounds inflicted on the
victims belie the claim of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hernandez alone sustained twenty one (21) wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the accused did not surrender
themselves and the weapons they used to the police authorities whose office was
just a few meters away from the scene of the crime helps negate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>claim of self-defense.</p>

sustain the claim of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court was convinced that one of the victims, <span class="SpellE">Petronio</span>
Rosales, was telling the truth when he testified on the circumstances of the
assault on him and his cousin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We see no
reason from the records why we should reverse this finding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the trial court that there was
conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence presented by
the prosecution clearly indicates that the acts and behavior of the accused
reveal their common purpose to assault and inflict harm upon the deceased and
that there was a concerted execution of that common purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Bacho</span>,
G.R. No. 66645, March 29, 1989) The existence of a concerted effort by the
accused can be further inferred from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">fact
</span>that both accused were together when provoked at the restaurant, were
still together when they met the victims and without any word, jointly and
immediately stabbed the deceased Hernandez and then turned against Rosales and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">simultaneously </span>ganged-up on him and
stabbed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court stated:</p>

statements in court by accused <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> Batas is
true that he alone and no other person participated in stabbing the deceased,

13 were stab wounds and 8 were hack wounds?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the very nature and appearance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This Court, then, does not see any reason to disturb the factual

84423, <st1:date year="1989" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1989</st1:date>)
this Court stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that it is the presence of the concurrence
of minds which is involved in conspiracy, the conspiracy may be inferred from
proof of facts and circumstances."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, we agree with the trial court's finding that there was
treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

G.R. Nos. 62968-69, <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1989</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"We sustain the finding of treachery against them as it is
clear that they had adopted means and methods to insure the commission of the
offenses without risk to themselves from any defense their unwary victims might
make.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears stressing that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">In </span>the case at

<p class="BODY">Regarding the trial court finding that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">was </span>evident premeditation, this Court
finds that the prosecution failed to show clear and convincing proof relative
to (1) the time when the appellant determined to commit the crime; (2) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">an </span>act manifestly indicating that the
two clung to that determination; and (3) sufficient lapse of time between
determination and execution to allow them to reflect upon the consequences of
their act (People v. <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>, G. R. No. 69374, March
16, 1989) as to indicate that evident premeditation attended the killing of
Hernandez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled that
the qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation was present because the
anger or ill-will of the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused </span>started
when they were still at the <span class="SpellE">Toyet's</span> Restaurant; that
both accused made their final determination to execute their criminal intent,
as they did, after the lapse of more than half an hour since the ill-feeling
started at said restaurant and the time they actually performed their criminal
acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 32) We find inadequate basis for this conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Garachico</u></span>, (133 SCRA 131):<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To authorize the finding of evident premeditation, it must
appear not only that the accused had made a decision to commit the crime prior
to the moment of its execution but that this decision was the result of
meditation, calculation or reflection or persistent attempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the lapse of thirty
minutes between the determination and execution of the crime is not sufficient
time for the accused to reflect upon the consequences of their act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We apply the <span class="SpellE"><u>Garachico</u></span> case as
controlling as the elapsed time was more or less thirty minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">evidence </span>shows that the victims stayed at the restaurant fifteen
to twenty minutes more after the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused
left and </span>thereafter met the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crimes are still murder and frustrated murder with treachery <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">considered </span>as the qualifying
circumstance, recidivism as a generic aggravating circumstance and with no
mitigating circumstance to offset the same.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
