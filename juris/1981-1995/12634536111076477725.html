of the layout of the land, alleged to consist of four noncontiguous parcels or

thousand three hundred forty-six and fifteen thousand eight hundred twenty-two
square meters, belonged to <span class="SpellE">Eduarda</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> or to her and her husband and were acquired after

in that year as tenant on those three lots (about two and two-tenths hectares),
as pretended by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">That circumstance alone shows the untrustworthiness of <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Barias</span>' evidence or
