saying that her father, Isidro, wanted to continue their talk about the

<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> but they failed to make a case against anyone

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In June 1975, after five
(5) years, the new Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, revived <span class="GramE">the</span> case when an
eyewitness, Morel <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>, claimed to have seen <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> killed. This allegedly took place on April 24,
1970 in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">Iguig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Morel <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>,
then only 8 years old testified that he was on his way to school at about two
o'clock in the afternoon when he heard someone moan from </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">direction of Isidro's house. Out of
curiosity, he scaled the concrete fence of the <span class="SpellE">Clores</span>'
residence and saw <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> <span class="SpellE">Clores</span>
sitting on top of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> who lay prone on the
ground. Using his left hand, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> gagged <span class="SpellE">Victorio's</span> mouth and, using the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span> pinned down <span class="SpellE">Victorio's</span>
arms to his chest. Meanwhile, </span><span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Clores</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> came and using the butt of a .22 caliber
rifle clubbed <span class="SpellE">Victorio's</span> head a number of times.
While this was going on, Isidro was in the balcony telling <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span>
to finish him. Isidro then ordered his two sons to carry the victim's body at
the back of the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Callueng</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> jumped into the yard to see what would
happen next but Isidro drove him off with a threat against his life if he would
tell the incident to anyone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Defense evidence is
denial and alibi. Appellants claim there was no reason to kill <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> considering their close affinity with his family.
Besides, they contend being elsewhere when the alleged slaying of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> took place. <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Clores</span> testified that when he left his house in 1963 he did
not return to <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> </span>until <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1975 when the case against him was filed. In
April 1970, he was in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, working for a
certain Virginia Tan in connection with a contract for the remodeling of her
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Isidro <span class="SpellE">Clores</span> declared that on April 19, 1970, he took a bus for
Manila and was taken ill with gastro­enteritis on the way. He had to spend the
night in the <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> Clinic in <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>. The following day, April 20, 1970, he took a
PAL plane for Manila and returned to <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> in the morning of April 28, 1970.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Gavino</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Clores</span> testified
that on April 24, 1970 he was at the Municipal Treasurer's Office of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span> where he was employed. It was a Friday and he was
preparing reports of the previous day collections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In pronouncing appellants
</span>guilty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of murder, the court </span><u>a</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">rationalized
its conclusion -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The witness knew all the accused. The time
of the commission of the crime was at daytime leaving no room for mistake or
uncertainty in the identification of all the accused. Thus the defense of alibi
cannot prevail over the positive identification of the witness Morel <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>. The identification made by Morel <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> which is direct and positive must prevail over and
above the individual defenses of alibi invoked by the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All the accused insist on their denial that they did not
commit the offense. That the investigation conducted by the authorities does
not warrant ample evidence for the filing of a case against them due to the
doubtful identity and description of the victim. Notwithstanding however the
barefaced denial of all the accused, their individual alibi and denial cannot
be sustained.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The other point raised by the defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">was </span>the non-presentation of the sack and nylon rope by the
prosecution, and two witnesses for the prose<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">cution, </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Yadan</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mellilin</span>. To the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">mind
</span>of the court,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>non-presentation of the prosecution
of the sack and nylon rope, as well as the two witnesses for the prosecution
does not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> enfeeble or weaken the
evidence of the prosecution, there being ample and convincing evidence to prove
that the accused were responsible for the mauling of the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Another point to be considered is the motive as proven by the
defense. The defense contend that the filing of this case was politically
inspired and motivated by Ex-Mayor Trinidad of <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, and also due to a land dispute between Luz <span class="SpellE">Magalad</span>, a close kin of Morel <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>.
Nonetheless, well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">settled is the rule
that when an accused was positively identified to have committed the felony and
was noticed and pointed to during the trial as the malefactor, motive necessarily
becomes </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">inconsequential </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">and deserves scant consideration. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">To </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the mind of the court, proof of motive is unimportant and trivial when
there is positive identification of the accused." (pp. 53-54, Decision)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

character of the slaying -- <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> bashing the

remain perched atop the fence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>stare

<blockquote>"3. From the
time the killing allegedly took place up to the time <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
testified in court more than 6 years have passed. For a boy of 8 years with
still developing mental faculties, <span class="SpellE">Callueng's</span> ability
to observe and recall the minutest details of the incident -- <span class="SpellE">Victorio's</span> haircut, the color of his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">skin, </span>the shirt he wore, the shade of
his pants, the quality of his shoes, the precise movement of every foot or hand
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">victim </span>and his aggressors
-- is too extraordinary to be true. <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">even recalled seeing <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
thrice before near the house of Isidro, including the name of the buses he
boarded, although admittedly there was nothing remarkable about those
occasions.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"More, <span class="SpellE">Callueng's</span> reaction after the
alleged killing was much unlike that of a boy of 8 years. Other boys would have
spoken about the incident to his classmates, friends or teachers as soon as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">they reached </span>school. There was nothing
secret about it since, according to <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>, ten
other persons saw what happened. But, strangely, <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
testified that he kept the matter to himself and told only his father about it.
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4. This brings
us to the 6-year delay <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> incurred before
reporting what he saw to the police. <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
testified that his fear of Isidro and what the latter would do to him deterred
him from immediately coming forward to testify. But this <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
excuse suffers from weakness. Firstly, as <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
admitted, Isidro did not have a reputation for violence and he never threatened
to harm <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> after the alleged incident.
(Transcript, November 17, 1976, p. 172) Secondly, there is no evidence that
Isidro or any of his children held positions of power or influence in the
community as to be able to manipulate police investigation of the matter.
Thirdly, in 1972 shortly after martial law was proclaimed, the investigation of
the case was re­newed and the military placed Isidro under detention for about
a month. <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> could have come forward then since
the person he feared could no longer harm him. Yet, <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>
re<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">mained silent. His sudden emergence </span>6
years after the incident is accordingly suspect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. <span class="SpellE">Callueng's</span> testimony has an aftermath. He executed a sworn
state­ment on April 8, 1979 (Exhibit 2) retracting his testimony in court and
blaming the Chief of Police, Tomas <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, for coaxing
him into testifying falsely. The municipal circuit judge of <span class="SpellE">Amulung</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Iguig</span> identified the statement and testified that
<span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> swore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to
</span>it freely. (Transcript, Oct. 6, 1981, pp. 55-57; Jan. 22, 1982, pp. 3-4)
<span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> testified anew later, branding his
retraction as a product of fear of Isidro who accompanied him before the
municipal judge. However, <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span> was unable to
state that Isidro then in­timidated or coerced him. Isidro tes­tified on
rebuttal that it was <span class="SpellE">Callueng</span>, accompanied by a
certain Romeo <span class="SpellE">Yadan</span>, who came to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">see </span>him offering to retract his
previous testimony. Consequently, Isidro brought them to the municipal judge.</blockquote>
