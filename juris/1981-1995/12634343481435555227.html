eyewitnesses, Ronald Broquel and Helen Lalata, are as follows:<span style="font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 6, 1988, at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening, the
deceased Dominador Lalata was in front of the store of one Lolita Lalata at
Salaan, Mangaldan, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pangasinan, </span>Dominador
was drinking nipa wine with Ronald Broquel, Arturo Cendaña, and a few others,
when the accused-appellants Tito Pasiliao and Arturo Pasiliao arrived <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">less </span>than an hour later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tito Pasiliao, without any warning, drew a jungle bolo from a
scabbard tucked in his back, rushed towards Dominador and hacked him in the
head, in the scapular area, deltoid area and the right hand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Wounded and mustering all the strength be could summon, Dominador tried to run
towards his sister's house which was some 12 meters away from the store.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tito
and Arturo caught up with him in the landing of the </span>said house; then,
Tito held Dominador by the hair while Armando collared him.  Both of the accused fired at Dominador, then
ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dominador was rushed to the hospital but died before reaching the
same.  The autopsy report showed that
the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. D-9035, only accused Armando Pasiliao was tried

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused-appellant
would deny his complicity in </span>the crime by alleging alibi.  He testified that on December 6, 1988 at
about 6:30 in the evening, he was at his shop in Poblacion, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Mangaldan, Pangasinan, </span>repairing the
television set of one Ramon Aldana.  It
took him more than an hour to finish the job.  After which, he and Ramon drunk some bottles of beer inside his
shop.  He did not issue a receipt for
the repair fee as Ramon did not ask for one.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have consistently held that alibi is a weak defense because it
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">easy </span>to fabricate.  In order to be given full faith and credit,
it must be clearly established and must not leave for doubt as to its
plausibility and verity.  The accused
must show not only that he was not at the place where the crime was committed
but that it was impossible for him to be there.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Here,

December 6, 1988 at around 7:00 o'clock p.m.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">By his</span> own admission, the
accused Armando Pasiliao testified that his shop is only<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

incident took place.  He further
testified that Salaan, Mangaldan, the scene of the crime, may be reached by
tricycle or calesa.  We have ruled time
and again that no physical impossibility exists where the distance between the
scene of the crime and the place where the accused allegedly was at the time
would take only fifteen to twenty minutes to negotiate by jeep, or where it can
be travers<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ed</span> by walking in one
and a half hours, or where the places involved are only two hundred meters

Here, there was no such impossibility.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, accused-appellants' denial cannot prevail over the
positive and credible testimony of the prosecution witnesses that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused committed </span>the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">This Court places great reliance on the findings of the trial
court based on the facts directly available to it as disclosed by the parties
during the trial, especially in criminal cases where the identity of the
culprit is the pivotal issue.  The
conclusions of the trial judge who had the opportunity to observe and examine
the witnesses and to determine whether or not they were honoring their oaths,
are generally accepted on appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

accused-appellant would have this Court disregard the testimony of Helen <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Lalata.  </span>He contended that being a relative of the deceased, her testimony
was biased and was not worthy of credence.  Suffice it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>state that
mere relationship to the victim need not automatically tarnish the testimony of
witnesses.  When there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>no showing of improper motive on
the part of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">witnesses for</span>
testifying against the accused, the fact that they were related to the victim
did not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of full faith and
credit.  On the contrary, their natural
interest in securing the conviction of the guilty would deter them from implicating
persons other than the culprits; otherwise, the latter would thereby gain
immunity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

No improper motive was imputed against Helen Lalata that would make her
implicate the accused-appellants in the criminal cases filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">against the </span>latter.  She had positively identified the accused as
the assailants.  Hence, We are

<p class="BODY">We have time and again held that an NBI chemist's finding that
the paraffin test on the person of the appellant is negative, is not conclusive

<p class="BODY">The trial court appreciated the presence of the qualifying
circumstance of treachery, thus elevating the crime to Murder; and the
aggravating circumstance of nighttime.  There was treachery when the offender committed any of the crime against
persons employing means, methods or forms in the execution without risk to
himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make, which
means that no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">opportunity was given </span>to
the latter to do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
deceased Dominador was unarmed, and the attack was so sudden as to leave him
utterly defenseless.  The hacking came
like the bolt of lightning and without any warning.  He tried to escape but his assailants easily caught up with him
as he was too weak to run, and too weak to defend himself.  Without giving him any opportunity or means
to repel the attack, Tito and Armando held his head, collared him and shot
him.  This was treachery.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court appreciated nocturnity against appellants solely
on the basis of the fact on record that the crime was committed at about 7:00
o'clock in the evening.  We find this
erroneous.  By and of itself, nighttime
is not an aggravating circumstance.  It
becomes so only when it is especially sought by the offender, or taken
advantage of by him to facilitate the commission of the crime or to ensure his
immunity from capture.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, there was no proof to show that the aggravating circumstance
of nighttime was deliberately sought by accused-appellant in committing the
crime.  As such, said circumstance
should be disallowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that it was error for the
lower court to impose the indeterminate penalty of from 7 years and 4 months to
20 years in Criminal Case No. D-9357 for violation of P.D. No. 1866 or Illegal
Possession of Firearm and Ammunitions.  Section 1, paragraph 2 of P.D. 1866 provides that "if homicide or
murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm, the penalty of death
shall be imposed." The death penalty cannot be imposed under the 1987
Constitution.  The Indeterminate Sentence
Law does not apply to persons convicted of offenses punished with death or life
imprisonment <u>(reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> The
trial court committed an error in giving the accused Armando Pasiliao the
benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.<span style="font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the opinion of this Court, in the light of the foregoing
analysis and the applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter to hold that
the evidence was sufficient to sustain the judgment finding the
accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime as charged, the
judgment in Criminal Case No. D-9035 is hereby affirmed, but the judgment in
Criminal Case No. D-9357 is hereby modified imposing the penalty of <u>Reclusion</u>
<u>Perpetua</u> on the accused, Armando Pasiliao.</p>
