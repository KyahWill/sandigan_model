When loading or unloading cargo at the Sta. Ana pier and Sasa wharf in the Port of Davao City, petitioner is compelled by the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) to avail itself exclusively of the arrastre and stevedoring services of respondent Filipinas Port Services, Inc., subject to the payment of fees provided by PPA rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Respondent Filipinas Port Services, Inc., (Filport, for short) is a domestic corporation engaged in stevedoring and arrastre services and is the exclusive cargo handling operator-contractor for all inter-island vessels calling at the port of Davao City, including those owned and operated by petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>.<br><br>Sometime in October 1981, respondent Filport filed a complaint for sum of money against herein petitioner, alleging that as of 31 May 1981, petitioner corporation's outstanding account for stevedoring, handling and other services rendered to it by respondent amounted to P375,263.05, itemized as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" align="center" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td width="33%">Stevedoring bills</td><td width="33%">P346,725.21</td><td width="34%">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Contractor's tax</td><td>101.25</td><td>P346,826.46</td></tr><tr><td>Handling bills</td><td>1,253.49</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Contractor's tax</td><td>27.40</td><td>1,280.89</td></tr><tr><td>Standby time fees</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>20,886.40</td></tr><tr><td>Forklift rentals</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>1,330.00</td></tr><tr><td>Shifting cargoes</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>4,939.30</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Total . . .</td><td>P375.263.05</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>and that, despite repeated demands, petitioner corporation failed and refused to pay the account, thus prompting Filport to file the case, and praying that judgment be rendered ordering petitioner corporation to pay:<br><blockquote><ol type="1"><li> the amount of P375.263.05 with interest at 15% per annum from July 16, 1981 when the last written demand was made against defendant corporation until the account is fully paid;<br><br></li><li> the further sum equivalent to 25% of the principal amount of P375,263.05 as reimbursement for attorney's fees;<br><br></li><li> and granting such other reliefs as are just and equitable under the premises.</li></ol></blockquote>On 22 January 1985, the court a quo rendered judgment adverse to the petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the assailed decision was affirmed in toto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Hence, this petition for review.<br><br>The present petition questions only the stevedoring charge of P232,632.00 for ten-footer containers.

In ruling for the respondent Filport, the court a quo aptly said:<br><blockquote>"x x x The problem and confusion accordingly cropped-up when defendant interpreted the provisions of said Administrative order in relation to the earlier issued Administrative Order No. 06-78 dated May 24, 1978, which should not allegedly be the case since the latter applies specifically only to container operations at the North Harbor, Port of Manila and certainly, as the Court observed, the rates provided in each Administrative Orders (Exhs. "1" and "3" or "C") are not uniform. The same problem or confusion would not have happened also if defendant only considered PPA Memorandum Circular No. 06-81 dated April 22, 1981 which clarified the term "ISO Container", its designation, height, width, length and weight having been stated supra. In billing defendant for stevedoring and arrastre services indicated in Exhs. "0" to "0-42" which support the computation appearing in defendant's Statement of Account (Exh. "A"), plaintiff relied on PPA Memorandum Circular No. 004, PMU Davao dated May 21, 1979 (Exh. "B"), which circularized that all rates in container handling for domestic operation in all ports shall be based on PPA Adminstrative Order No. 08-79 dated March 12, 1979. Under said administrative order, the rates for stevedoring and arrastre services were general for all ISO containers. It did not classify or provide the dimensions of containers for said rates to be made applicable. On the other hand, if the rates were subsequently increased, they were based on subsequently issued administrative orders, thus, it cannot be said what the rates charged by plaintiff for its ten-footer containers of "mini vans" were illegal and unauthorized x x x".<br><br><center>x x x</center><br>"After a careful and painstaking evaluation of all the issues and arguments raised by both parties, taken together with their respective testimonial and documentary evidences, it is the Court's considered view and opinion, as it so holds, that plaintiff's version is more credible and duly supported by evidence. Just to recapitulate, plaintiff's rates for stevedoring and arrastre services which were imposed at the time when PPA has not yet come up with rates specifically applicable for ten-footers and below were not merely imposed by plaintiff on its own free will but were based on PPA administrative Order No. 08-79 of March 12, 1979, which prescribed the rates in container handling for domestic operations in all ports, including North Harbor, Port of Manila, and the Port of Davao as well. If the rates were later on increased, again, they were based on specific PPA administrative Orders, leaving however, the rates specifically applicable to ten-footer containers and below unresolved, until on October 15, 1981, when PPA issued Administrative Order No. 11A-81, which finally prescribed the rates applicable to ten-footer containers and below but at the same time however, provided for a non-retroactivity clause. So that, even assuming arguendo that plaintiff erred in its imposition of the rates for defendant's 10-footer containers which the latter, just the same, failed to prove by competent evidence like proofs to the effect that other shipping corporation serviced by plaintiff are also questioning the rates which the plaintiff imposed for ten-footer containers, the defendant has no other alternative but pay or settle its outstanding account with the plaintiff, the said administrative order being clear and decisive to this effect. Defendant's claim of alleged invalidity of PPA Memorandum Circular No. 06-81 dated April 22, 1981 (Exh. "M"), which could have then long settled the problem existing between the parties since it once and for all clarified the term "ISO Containers", cannot be given any merit since it constitutes a collateral attack on the validity of said memorandum circular which cannot be allowed in the case at bar. On the contrary, since it has not been revoked, modified, recalled or declared as null and void by the PPA Board itself, the same stands in full force and effect and the rates imposed on the basis of said clarification should, by legal implication, be also considered legal, valid and authorized. From the totality of plaintiff's evidences, the Court sees no cogent or compelling reasons to disturb the computation made by plaintiff on defendant's outstanding account for stevedoring and arrastre services, which as of May 31, 1981, stood at P375,263.05 (Exh. "A"). The Court is in full accord with plaintiff's view and position and on the basis of all the foregoing considerations finds, and so holds, that it has fully established its cause of action against defendant by preponderance of evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></blockquote>Likewise, the Court of Appeals in affirming the decision of the court a quo, made the following proper observations:<br><blockquote>"x x x PPA, Administrative Order No. 06-78 (Exh. 1) as its subject indicates applies only to container operations at the North Harbor, Port of Manila. Upon the other hand, PPA Administrative order No. 08-79 (Exh. C) prescribes the arrastre and stevedoring rates for container handling in the domestic operations in all ports. It does not make any distinction on the size of the container nor does it make any reference to any previous administrative order for its understanding. For not making any distinction to size, some quarters may find fault on its wisdom but that is a matter addressed to the Philippine Port Authority. PPA Administrative Order No. 08-79 is however clear by itself and hence ought to be enforced even by judicial authorities. To be sure, the interpretation suggested by defendant-appellant will, by its own admission, result in a legal hiatus, a situation abhorred by rules of legal hermeneutics. Since the stevedoring rate of plaintiff-appellee is sanctioned by PPA Administrative Order No. 08-79, it follows that the trial court was correct when it refused to apply the general principles of fairness, justice and equity in fixing the stevedoring rate due and owing to the plaintiff-appellee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>”.</blockquote>The other contentions in the instant petition have been carefully discussed and disposed of by the decisions of the court a quo and the Court of Appeals. We find no reversible error in the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the trial and appellate courts. Accordingly, the assailed decision of respondent court should be sustained.<br><br>However, on the issue of attorney's fees, we are constrained to reduce the award, for being grossly excessive. An award of 10% of the amount of P375,263.05 is reasonable.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is DENIED. As modified, the decision under review is hereby AFFIRMED.
