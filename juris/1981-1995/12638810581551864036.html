				<H3>MA. CARMEN G. AQUINO-SARMIENTO, PETITIONER, VS.
MANUEL L. MORATO (IN HIS CAPACITY AS CHAIRMAN OF THE MTRCB) AND THE MOVIE &
TELEVISION REVIEW AND CLASSIFICATION BOARD, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At issue in this petition is the citizen's right of access to
official records as guaranteed by the <span class="GramE">constitution.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In February 1989, petitioner, herself a member of respondent
Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), wrote its records
officer requesting that she be allowed to examine the board's records
pertaining to the voting slips accomplished by the individual board members
after a review of the movies and television productions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is on the basis of said slips that films
are <span class="GramE">either banned</span>, cut or classified accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the said request, the records officer informed
petitioner that she has to secure prior clearance from respondent Manuel <span class="SpellE">Morato</span>, as chairman of MTRCB, to gain access to the records
sought to be examined.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's request was eventually denied by respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> on the ground that whenever the members of the board
sit in judgment over a film, their decisions as reflected in the individual
voting slips partake the nature of conscience votes and as such, are purely and
completely private and personal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the submission of respondents that the individual voting slips is the exclusive
property of the member concerned and anybody who wants access thereto must
first secure his (the member's) consent, otherwise, a request <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> may be legally denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues, on the other hand, that the records she wishes
to examine are public in character and other than providing for reasonable
conditions regulating the manner and hours of examination, respondents <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> and the classification board have no authority to
deny any citizen seeking examination of the board's records.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1989</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> called an executive meeting of the
MTRCB to discuss, among others, the issue raised by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said meeting, seventeen (17) members of
the board voted to declare their individual voting records as classified
documents which rendered the same inaccessible to the public without clearance
from the chairman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> denied petitioner's request to
examine the voting slips.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it
was only much later, i.e., on July 27, 1989, that respondent Board issued
Resolution No. 10-89 which declared as confidential, private and personal, the
decision of the reviewing committee and the voting slips of the members.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner brought the matter to the attention of the Executive
Secretary, which in turn, referred the same to respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span>
for appropriate comment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another incident which gave rise to this petition occurred in a
board meeting held on <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that meeting, respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> told the board that he has ordered some deletions on
the movie "<span class="SpellE">Mahirap</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magmahal</span>" notwithstanding the fact that said
movie was earlier approved for screening by the Board with classification
"R-18 without cuts".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
explained that his power to unilaterally change the decision of the Review
Committee is authorized by virtue of MTRCB Resolution No. 88-1-25 (dated June
22, 1988) which allows the chairman of the board "to downgrade a film
(already) reviewed especially those which are controversial."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner informed the <span class="GramE">Board,</span> however,
that respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> possesses no authority to
unilaterally reverse a decision of the review committee under PD 1986 (Creating
the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the matter was referred by the Deputy Executive Secretary
to the Justice Secretary, the latter opined that PD 1896 does not vest
respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> any authority to unilaterally
reverse the decision of the review committee but declined to comment on the
constitutionality of Res. No. 10-89 on the ground that the resolution thereof
is a judicial prerogative (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 38-42).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Justice Secretary's opinion to the contrary notwithstanding,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> opted to ignore it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition anchored on the following:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MORATO AND THE
MTRCB BY APPROVING AND ENFORCING RESOLUTION NO.</span> 10-89 ACTED WITH GRAVE
ABUSE OF DISCRETION TANTAMOUNT TO LACK OF JURISDICTION BECAUSE THE SAME
VIOLATES ARTICLE III SECTION 7 OF THE 1987 CONSTITUTION.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MTRCB
RESOLUTION NO.</span> 88-1-25 HAS NO LEGAL BASIS AND CONSTITUTES AN UNLAWFUL
DELEGATION OF DISCRETIONARY POWERS</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"C.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MORATO AND THE
MTRCB BY REFUSING TO ABIDE BY OPINION NO.</span> <span class="GramE">1 SERIES OF
1990 OF THE SECRETARY OF JUSTICE AND BY INSISTING ON THE VALIDITY OF RESOLUTION
NO.</span> 88-1-25 ACTED CAPRICIOUSLY, ARBITRARILY, IN BAD FAITH, IN EXCESS OF
THEIR JURISDICTION, AND WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner therefore seeks the nullification of 1) MTRCB
Resolution No. 88-1-25 which allows the Chairman of the Board to unilaterally
downgrade a film (already) reviewed especially those which are controversial
and 2) MTRCB RESOLUTION No. 10-89 (dated July 27, 1989) declaring as strictly
confidential, private and personal a) the decision of a reviewing committee
which previously reviewed a certain film and b) the individual voting slips of
the members of the committee that reviewed the film.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents argue at the outset that the instant petition should
be dismissed outright for having failed to comply with the doctrine of
exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine
of exhaustion of administrative remedies simply provides that before a party
litigant is allowed resort to the courts, he is required to comply with all
administrative remedies available under the law (Rosales v. Court of Appeals,
165 SCRA 344 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rationale
behind this <span class="SpellE">salutory</span> principle is that for reasons of
practical considerations, comity and convenience, the courts of law will not
entertain a case until all the available administrative remedies provided by
law have been resorted to and the appropriate authorities have been given ample
opportunity to act and to correct the errors committed in the administrative
level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the error is rectified,
judicial intervention would then be unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies is not absolute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
applicability of the principle admits of certain exceptions, such as:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) when no administrative review is provided
by law; 2) when the only question involved is one of law (<span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span>, 170 SCRA 256 [1989], citing Aguilar v.
Valencia, 40 SCRA 210 [1971]; <span class="SpellE">Malabanan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ramento</span>, 129 SCRA 359 [1984]; <span class="SpellE">Bagatsing</span>
v. Ramirez, 74 SCRA 306; Del Mar v. Philippine Veterans Administration, 51 SCRA
340 [1973]; <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> v. Provincial Board, 106 Phil.
466 [1959]; 3) where the party invoking the doctrine is guilty of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Tan v.
Veterans' <span class="SpellE">Backpay</span> Commission [1969]; ; 4) where the
challenged administrative action is patently illegal, arbitrary and oppressive
(<span class="SpellE">Azur</span> v. Provincial Board, 27 SCRA 50 [1969];
National Development Co. v. Collector of Customs of Manila, 9 SCRA 429 [1963];
5) where there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that<span style="">&nbsp; </span>would greatly prejudice the complainant (<span class="SpellE">Gravador</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mamigo</span>, 20 SCRA 742
[1967]; <span class="SpellE">Azuelo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Arnaldo</span>,
108 Phil. 293 [1960]; 6) where to exhaust administrative review is impractical
and unreasonable (<span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>,
43 SCRA 291); and 7) where the rule of qualified political agency applies (<span class="SpellE">Demaisip</span> v. Court of Appeals, 106 Phil. 237 [1906]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised in the instant petition is one of law, hence,
the doctrine of non-exhaustion of administrative remedy relied upon by
respondents is inapplicable and cannot be given any effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, records are replete with events
pointing to the fact that petitioner adhered to the administrative processes in
the disposition of the assailed resolutions of public respondents prior to
filing the instant petition by, among others, writing the Executive Secretary
and bringing the matter to the attention of the Office of the President (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 145-147).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' claim that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative
remedies must therefore fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having disposed of the procedural objection raised by
respondents, <span class="GramE">We</span> now proceed to resolve the issues
raised by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, <span class="GramE">We</span> find respondents' refusal to allow petitioner to examine
the records of respondent MTRCB, pertaining to the decisions of the review
committee as well as the individual voting slips of its members, as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of petitioner's constitutional right of access to
public records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, Sec.
7, Art. III of the Constitution provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"The right of the people to information on matters of public
concern shall be recognized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Access</u>
<u>to</u> <u>official</u> <u>records,</u> <u>and</u> <u>to</u> <u>documents,</u>
<u>and</u> <u>papers</u> <u>pertaining</u> <u>to</u> <u>official</u> <u>acts,</u>
<u>transactions,</u> <u>or</u> <u>decisions</u>, as well as to government research
data used as basis for policy development, shall be afforded the citizen,
subject to such limitations as may be provided by law." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As We held in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> v. Civil Service
Commission (150 SCRA 530 [1987]), this <span class="SpellE">consitutional</span>
provision is self-<span class="SpellE">executory</span> and supplies "the
rules by means of which the right to information may be enjoyed (Cooley, A
Treatise on Constitutional Limitations 167 [1927]) by guaranteeing the right
and mandating the duty to afford access to sources of information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the fundamental right therein
recognized may be asserted by the people upon the ratification of the
constitution without need for any ancillary Act of the Legislature (Id. at p.
165).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What may be provided for by the
Legislature are reasonable conditions and limitations upon the access to be
afforded which must, of necessity, be consistent with the declared State policy
of full public disclosure of all transactions <span class="GramE">involving</span>
public interest (Constitution, Art. II, Sec. 28)." <span class="GramE">(See
also <span class="SpellE">Tañada</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span>, 136
SCRA 27 [1985]; <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>,
Jr., 170 SCRA 256 [1989]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents contend, however, that what is rendered by the
members of the board in reviewing films and reflected in their individual
voting slip is their individual vote of conscience on the motion picture or
television program and as such, makes the individual voting slip purely private
and personal; an exclusive property of the member concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The term private has been defined as "belonging to or
concerning, an individual person, company, or interest"; whereas, public
means "pertaining to, or belonging to, or affecting a nation, state, or
community at large" (People v. Powell, 274 NW 372 [1937]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May the decisions of respondent Board and the
individual members concerned, arrived at in an official capacity, be considered
private?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Certainly
not.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As may be gleaned from the
decree (PD 1986) creating the respondent classification board, there is no
doubt that its very existence is public in character; it is an office created
to serve public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It being the
case, respondents can lay no valid claim to privacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to privacy belongs to the
individual acting in his private capacity and not to a governmental agency or
officers tasked with, and acting in, the discharge of public duties (See <span class="SpellE">Valmonte</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, Jr., <u>supra</u>.)
There can be no invasion of privacy in the case at bar since what is sought to
be divulged is a product of action undertaken in the course of performing
official functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To declare otherwise
would be to clothe every public official with an impregnable mantle of
protection against public scrutiny for their official acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, the decisions of the Board and the individual voting
slips accomplished by the members concerned are acts made pursuant to their
official functions, and as such, are neither personal nor private in nature but
rather public in character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are,
therefore, public records access to which is guaranteed to the citizenry by no
less than the fundamental law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being a public right, the exercise thereof cannot be made contingent on
the discretion, nay, whim and caprice, of the agency charged with the custody
of the official records sought to be examined.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The constitutional recognition of the citizen's right of access to
official records cannot be made dependent upon the consent of the members of
the board concerned, otherwise, the said right would be rendered nugatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span> (80 Phil. 383
[1948]):</p>

<blockquote>"Except, perhaps when it is clear that the purpose of the
examination is unlawful, or sheer, idle curiosity, we do not believe it is the
duty under the law of registration officers to concern themselves with the
motives, reasons, and objects of the person seeking access to the records. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It is not their prerogative to see that the
information which the records contain is not flaunted before public gaze, or
that scandal is not made of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If</u>
<u>it</u> <u>be</u> <u>wrong</u> <u>to</u> <u>publish</u> <u>the</u> <u>contents</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>records,</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>legislature</u>
<u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>the</u> <u>officials</u> <u>having</u> <u>custody</u> <u>thereof</u>
<u>which</u> <u>is</u> <u>called</u> <u>upon</u> <u>to</u> <u>devise</u> <u>a</u>
<u>remedy</u>." (<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to point out that this Court in the 1948 case
of <span class="SpellE">Subido</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, <u>supra</u>,
upheld the right to information based on the statutory right then provided in
Sec. 56 of the Land Registration Act (Act 496, as amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> see
no cogent reason why said right, now <span class="SpellE">constitutionalized</span>,
should be given less efficacy and primacy than what the fundamental law
mandates.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not unaware of RA 6713 (Code of Conduct and Ethical <span class="SpellE">Standarads</span> for Public Officials and Employees) which
provides, among others, certain exceptions as regards the availability of
official records or documents to the requesting public, e.g., closed door
Cabinet sessions and deliberations of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state, however, that the
exceptions therein enumerated find no application in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's request is not concerned with
the deliberations of respondent Board but with its documents or records made
after a decision or order has been rendered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither will the examination involve disclosure of trade secrets or
matters pertaining to national security which would otherwise limit the right
of access to official records (See <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> v. Civil
Service Commission, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We are likewise not impressed with the proposition advanced by
respondents that respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span> is empowered by PD
1986 to unilaterally downgrade or upgrade a film reviewed especially those
which are controversial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent <span class="GramE">provisions of said decree provides</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Decision.</span> - The
decision of the BOARD either approving or <span class="SpellE">disaproving</span>

the date of receipt by the BOARD of an application for the purpose x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For each review session, the Chairman of the Board shall
designate a sub-committee composed of at least three BOARD members to undertake

designated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After receipt of the written
decision of the sub-committee, a motion for reconsideration in writing may be
made, upon which the Chairman of the Board shall designate a sub-committee of
five BOARD members to undertake a second review session, whose decision on
behalf of the Board shall be rendered through a majority of the sub-committee members
so designated and present at the second review session.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second review session shall be presided
over by the Chairman, or the Vice-Chairman.<span style="">&nbsp;

entirety.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second decision of the BOARD shall be final, with the

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the powers and functions of the MTRCB Chairman
are found in Section 5 of the same decree as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Executive Officer.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- "The Chairman of the BOARD shall be
the Chief Executive Officer of the BOARD.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He shall exercise the following functions, powers and duties:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 69.3pt; text-indent: -25.65pt;">“(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Execute, implement and enforce the decisions,
orders, awards, rules and regulations issued by the BOARD;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 69.3pt; text-indent: -25.65pt;">“(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Direct and supervise the operations and the

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 67.5pt; text-indent: -23.85pt;">“(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Establish the internal organization and
administrative procedures of the BOARD, and recommend to the BOARD the
appointment of the necessary administrative and subordinate personnel; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 69.3pt; text-indent: -25.65pt;">"(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Exercise such other powers and functions and
perform such duties as are not specifically lodged in the BOARD."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is at once apparent from a reading of the above provisions of
PD 1986 that respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato</span>, as Chairman of the MTRCB,
is not vested with any authority to reverse or overrule by himself alone a
decision rendered by a committee which conducted a review of motion pictures or
television programs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power to classify motion pictures into categories such as
"General Patronage" or "For Adults Only" is vested with the
respondent Board itself and not with the Chairman thereof (Sec. 3 [e], PD
1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Chief Executive Officer,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Morato's</span> function as Chairman of the Board
calls for the implementation and execution, not modification or reversal, of
the decisions or orders of the latter (Sec. 5 [a], Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power of classification having been
reposed by law exclusively with the respondent Board, it has no choice but to
exercise the same as mandated by law, i.e., as a collegial body, and not
transfer it elsewhere or discharge said power through the intervening mind of
another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Delegata</span>
<span class="SpellE">potestas</span> non <span class="SpellE">potest</span> <span class="SpellE">delegari</span> - a delegated power cannot be delegated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since the act of classification involves
an exercise of the Board's discretionary power with more reason the Board
cannot, by way of the assailed resolution, delegate said power for it is an
