<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1980</st1:date>,

project.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in December, 1980, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
agreed with Leonard Earl <span class="SpellE">Pitcock</span>, the president of <span class="SpellE">Hercon</span>, Inc. that the latter “will participate in 70% of
all collections (of <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>) from MPWH including

made payments to <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> on the basis of the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Decision, Court

failed to pay its progress billings and its share in the price escalation costs
paid by the MPWH.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 10, 1983, <span class="SpellE">Hercon</span>, Inc. filed
a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, praying for "the

February 5, 1981 to May 22, 1981 for the balance of plaintiff's dredging
accomplishments and contract price escalation on its dredging works and

accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
set up a counterclaim for actual, moral and exemplary damages as well as

<blockquote>On the prayers for recovery of damages and attorney’s fees, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that both parties have violated their contract on
the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> floodway project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The appealed judgment awarded defendant the sums of P7<span class="GramE">,370,450.31</span> as actual damages, P500,000.00 as moral damages,
P200,000.00 as exemplary damages and the sum of P300,000.00 as attorney's

of actual damages occasioned by the damages he had suffered due to the
abandonment by plaintiff of its dredging job and the defects and deficiencies

indebted in the total sum of P6<span class="GramE">,147,103.70</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is modified; as We hold
that defendant is liable to plaintiff for price escalation in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,147,103.70</span>; while plaintiff is liable to defendant for
actual damages in the amount of P7,370,450.31; hence offsetting both
accountabilities from each other, the only amount due defendant from plaintiff
is the sum of P1,223,346.61, without interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No special pronouncement as to costs.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;

alleged failure of <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> to pay his obligations

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, however,
the documentary evidence on record proves that <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
was up to date in paying all of <span class="SpellE">Hercon's</span>

after the stoppage of work on September, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Inc. to resume work on the project but when the latter refused, <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> ordered the bank to stop payment (TSN, Feb. 17,
1986, pp. 41-42).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records also show that
<span class="SpellE">Hercon</span>, Inc. ignored numerous conferences requested

13.0pt">could </span>have resolved the issue on payment with which <span class="SpellE">Hercon</span>, Inc. tried to justify its refusal to continue the
project.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, there is basis not only for awarding actual damages but
moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees to <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
whose contract for the entire project with the MPWH was abruptly terminated due
to the malicious and unjustified abandonment by <span class="SpellE">Hercon</span>,
Inc. of its undertaking in the project.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amounts awarded by the trial court for moral and exemplary
damages and attorney's fees to <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> are
reasonable, considering his reputation as a contractor and the painful ordeal
he has gone through.</p>
