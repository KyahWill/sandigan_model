<p class="BODY">In their separate extrajudicial confessions taken before PC Major

R. Marquez, accused <span class="SpellE">Guiamil</span> <span class="SpellE">Bari</span>
and Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> pointed to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> and Major de Guzman as the masterminds of the
kidnapping plot and negotiators for the payment of ransom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dominic Simon, father of the victim, Esteban <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> and Ram <span class="SpellE">Buxani</span> likewise
gave their separate statements to the Philippine Constabulary narrating how
both accused acted as negotiators for payment of ransom in exchange for the
victim’s release (<span class="SpellE">Appellee’s</span> Brief, p. 20).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the motion of the prosecution (Original Records, p. 313),
the trial court, on <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1982</st1:date>,
ordered the dismissal of the case against accused Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span>
@ “Ting” and he was allowed to become a state witness for the prosecution (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 332-­333).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, said accused
failed to testify in court prompting the prosecution to petition for his <span class="SpellE">reinclusion</span> in the information (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.

ordered the issuance of a warrant of arrest against Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span>
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 434).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his arrest,
he signified his intention to testify for the state, hence the prosecution
filed a motion to lift the order of <span class="SpellE">reinclusion</span> and
arrest of Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
570-571).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was acted upon in
open court on <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1983</st1:date>
(TSN, March 16, 1983, p. 205).</p>

<p class="BODY">Major Rolando de Guzman questioned the jurisdiction of the lower
court over his person invoking the provisions of Presidential Decree Nos. 1882,
1822-A and 1850 (CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 49).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on February 14, 1983, in G.R.
No. 62798 entitled Rolando A. de Guzman vs. Hon. Alejandro R. <span class="SpellE">Leopando</span>, etc., the Supreme Court issued a temporary
restraining order enjoining “respondent Judge from further proceeding with the
arraignment and trial of petitioner-accused Maj. Rolando de Guzman and from
enforcing and/or implementing all orders and processes issued in Criminal Case
No. 860 entitled ‘People of the Philippines, plaintiff, vs. Maj. Rolando de
Guzman, et al., accused’, of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
Branch II, now Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City
relating to said petitioner-accused.” (Original Records, pp. 486-490).</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of said restraining order, the trial court was unable to
take cognizance of the case with respect to Major de Guzman.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the civilian accused during the hearing verbally moved
for separate trial of their case from the military accused Major Rolando de
Guzman on the ground of their constitutional right for speedy trial (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, trial proceeded as to <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.</p>

p. 141).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The escapees remained at large

<p class="BODY">But appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan’s</span> conviction
was anchored primarily on the testimony of the state witness Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> @ “Ting” who testified that he was an escort of
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in the
morning of <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1982</st1:date>,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> asked him to look for someone
who knows how to kidnap and he recommended Commander <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
stated that any of the children of Dominic Simon will be kidnapped and a ransom
of P500,000.00 will be asked from the parents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the evening of the same day, he brought Commander <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mimang</span> and Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span>
to appellant’s house (TSN, March 16, 1983, pp. 219-223).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was agreed during said meeting that Major
de Guzman and appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> would act as
negotiators for the ransom money while <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mimang</span> would act as guides who knew many officers in the
military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ting <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span>
was to act as an errand boy to Commander <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="3">March
 24, 1982</st1:date>, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o’clock</st1:time>
in the evening, per agreement of the group, Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span>
kidnapped Deborah Simon and she was brought to <span class="SpellE">Malagapas</span>
(CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 90).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1982</st1:date>, he saw appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> at
his house and he was asked to deliver a bag containing things for Deborah Simon
to <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he found out that he was being
followed so he went back to appellant’s house and left the bag there (TSN,
March 17, 1983, pp. 3402-3406).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 29, 1982, he met Major de Guzman at appellant’s house
where he was informed that appellant will not anymore help in Deborah’s <span style="">rescue </span>because it was doing him harm
and that Major de Guzman will take over appellant’s role in the
negotiation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was further instructed
to look for <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was able to get in touch with <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Arsad</span></span><span style=""> </span>at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Mabini</span>

<span class="SpellE">Esteros</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 3434-3438).</p>

<p class="BODY">The meeting took place as scheduled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Major de Guzman brought <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mimang</span> and the state witness, to a restaurant at <span class="SpellE">Awang</span> where they talked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, he was seated at a distance that is why he does not know the
topic of their conversation (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 3455-3457).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the restaurant, they proceeded to the
house of <span style="">Ram </span><span class="SpellE">Buxani</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and <span class="SpellE">Mimang</span> were
left in the car while Major de Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> went
inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, Mr.
Dominic Simon and his wife arrived (<u>Ibid</u>. pp. 3467-3481).</p>

<p class="BODY">He met <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mimang</span>
the following day at the stairway near the tailoring shop called Stewart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> informed him
that he was thankful to Mr. Dominic Simon <span style="">as
</span>the latter promised to accompany him to <span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span>
to help him surrender and to give him one sack of rice every month if he will
help in rescuing Deborah (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 3497-3500).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the evening, they went to the house of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> then proceeded to the house of
Ram <span class="SpellE">Buxani</span> with Major de Guzman (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
3505-3512).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">cross examination, </span>he
testified that <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> was not really interested in the
ransom money but rather in Deborah’s rescue so that Mr. Dominic Simon would
help him in his surrender to the authorities (TSN, March 18, 1983, p.
294).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he informed appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> of such desire of <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>,
he was told that they would take care of the matter after Deborah’s rescue,
that is, after they receive the ransom money (TSN, March 23, 1983, p. 309).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the advice of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>,
he proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
after giving his testimony on <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="4">April 8,
 1982</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 312).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant further informed him that if <span style="">he </span>is the one caught, there is possibility that he will divulge
everything (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 313).</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Abdul <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> that
appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> acted as negotiator was
collaborated by Assemblyman Esteban <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> and Mr.
Dominic Simon, the father of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter testified that in the morning of March 28, 1982, appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> was at his house when Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> arrived and that he left ahead of the latter (TSN,
November 19, 1982, pp. 2959-2962).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further testified that <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> talked with him
about the ransom money and when he said that he can afford only P10,000.00, the
former answered “<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">liit</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span>” and “<span class="SpellE">Wala</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ba</span>?”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then volunteered another P10,000.00 a week
after as he had to make more ice drops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> replied that they would talk again (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 2979-2980).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that,
upon the instructions of <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>, Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> asked him to prepare some clothes for his daughter
which the former would get from his place at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time> in the afternoon (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 3023).</p>

<p class="BODY">Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> testified that he
learned about the incident from his friends Mr. <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
Ramos, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Buxani</span>, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Uson</span>
and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Buenaflor</span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1982</st1:date> (TSN, November 17, 1982, pp.
5096-5097).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1982</st1:date>, he visited Mr. Dominic Simon to
check on the progress of the rescue operation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were a lot of people at the latter’s house but he was able to
identify appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> among the crowd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached Mr. Simon with whom he talked
for about thirty minutes at the conference room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
was not around anymore when he went out of the conference room with Mr.
Simon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then left with the latter for
the office of Chairman <span class="SpellE">Datumanong</span> where another
conference was held for twenty minutes (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 5100-5113).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their return at the Simon residence, he
was informed by Angela, Mr. Dominic Simon’s daughter, that <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan’s</span>
companion that morning was Mr. <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span>, one of the
rumored kidnappers of Deborah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He left
for appellant’s residence to confirm the information (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
5115-5119).</p>

<p class="BODY">At <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan’s</span> residence, there were
some people playing chess or mahjong that is why <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
led him to the ground floor at the same time motioning to him to keep quiet (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 5116-5121).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> to help in the early release of Deborah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
asked him if Mr. Simon can produce P500,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He answered that the sum is too big and that he thinks Mr. Simon does
not have that <span style="">much </span>money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> then
answered back that <span style="">then </span>Deborah
would not be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the course of
their conversation, the amount of ransom was lowered until finally <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> told him that for about P100,000.00, Deborah
might be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then requested
witness to ask Mr. Simon to prepare some clothes for Deborah and a small amount
of money which he will pick up at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time>
in the afternoon at Mr. Simon’s house (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 5123-5129).</p>

declaration that there was a meeting held in his house on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He declared that at that time he was at the house of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Magabilen</span> attending the blow-out given by <span class="SpellE">Isagani</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> (TSN, August 16,
1983, pp. 1442-1443).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, however, did
not deny seeing Mr. Simon on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="3">March 28,
 1982</st1:date> but denied negotiating for the ransom money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he may have inquired from
Mr. Simon how much he was willing to give as a reward for his daughter’s
release, but he did so only because he has not heard of any kidnapping where no
ransom was paid (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 1386-1390).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1984</st1:date>,

submitted by <span class="SpellE">Dra</span>. Carmen C. Valero, Chief of Clinics
of the Supreme Court Medical Clinic on the state of health of appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 290).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that Deborah Simon, single and a student, was
kidnapped, as narrated by her in open court, by three (3) armed men from the Polar
Ice Drop Factory at <span class="SpellE">Datu</span> <span class="SpellE">Piang</span>
St., <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> City on March 24, 1982 at 7:30 in the
evening and was held captive and transferred to different places until her
rescue on April 18, 1982 where four (4) abductors, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> <span class="SpellE">Unsa</span> @ “Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span>”, <span class="SpellE">Ibrahim</span> <span class="SpellE">Dris</span> @ “<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>”, <span class="SpellE">Mansabok</span> @ “<span class="SpellE">Boni</span>” and <span class="SpellE">Taha</span> <span class="SpellE">Kamd</span> @ “Bronson” were killed in the rescue operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue in the case at bar is whether or not the guilt of
appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> has been proved beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that it is for the trial court to determine the
existence of the requirements set out in Section 9 of Rule 119 of the Rules of
Court for the discharge of an accused for utilization as a state witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the court is satisfied that the discharge
of one or more co-accused so that they could testify for the prosecution is
proper, that court may issue the order of discharge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a co-accused is discharged and the
released witness actually testifies, any legal deficiency that might have
attended the discharge of the witness from the information does not affect the
admissibility and credibility of the testimony given, provided such testimony
is otherwise admissible and credible (<span class="SpellE">Jariol</span>, Jr. vs.
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 188 SCRA 475 [August 13, 1990]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise an <span class="SpellE">estabished</span>
rule that the Supreme Court regards with respect and will generally not disturb
the findings of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses, unless certain
facts of substance and value have been overlooked which if considered, might
affect the result of the case (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Dinola</span>, 183
SCRA 493 [March 22, 1990]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A careful
review of the records of this case shows no substantial reason to depart from
this established rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding appellant <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
guilty, the trial court held that there was conspiracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it held:</p>

<blockquote>“From the different acts of the accused starting from the meeting
that took place in the house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>,
first in the morning and secondly on the afternoon of March 22, 1982, attended
to by <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kadir</span> <span class="SpellE">Solaiman</span>, Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span>, Major de Guzman, and Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
wherein Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> stated that any of the
children of Dominic Simon was to be kidnapped and they were to demand from the
victim’s parents ransom money in the amount of P500,000.00; the role of the
group of Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span> was to execute the
physical kidnapping or snatching of the victim from the house of Dominic Simon;
the role of the group of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> and Major
de Guzman was to act as the negotiators for their demand of the ransom money;
that <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mimang</span> who
knew many officers and men of the military intelligence units were to act as
guides; that Ting <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> was to act as errand boy
to Commander <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span>;
that the actual kidnapping took place on March 24, 1982 per agreement reached
in the house of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>, that on March 28,
1982, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> went to the house of Dominic
Simon telling the latter that Deborah could be released for consideration of
P500,000.00; that per talk with Dominic Simon, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
decided to reduce said amount to only P300,000.00 and, later to even
P100,000.00; that when Dominic Simon stated he was not agreeable to the payment
of any ransom money for the release of his daughter Deborah but only the amount
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P10,000.00 not as ransom but a reward
to whoever could release his daughter Deborah; that Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>
showed disappointment after hearing Dominic Simon offering only P10,000.00
after a week’s time; that notwithstanding the promise made by Major de Guzman
and <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span> in the
house of Ram <span class="SpellE">Buxani</span> in the presence of Mr. and Mrs.
Dominic Simon, and Assemblyman and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> that
Deborah would be released on time for her graduation; that because no ransom
money was paid, Deborah Simon was not released by the kidnappers who have her
in their custody; that all the while there were couriers who communicated with
the kidnappers, then with Ting <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span> then <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span>, then to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span>,
then to the parents of Deborah Simon communication continued back to Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> then to <span class="SpellE">Arsad</span> <span class="SpellE">Ugalingan</span>, then to Ting <span class="SpellE">Manabilang</span>;
then to the courier, then to Commander <span class="SpellE">Sumakwel</span> and
then to Deborah Simon, shows that there was really the presence of conspiracy
among them.” (CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 166-167).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span>, 178 SCRA 56
(September 29, 1989), this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>“A conspiracy in the statutory language exists when two or more
persons come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide
to commit it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">objective then on the part of the
conspirators is to perform an act or </span>omission punishable by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required is assent to the
perpetration of such a misdeed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
must be their intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need <span style="">in </span>the language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span> in the early leading case of <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Magcomot</span>, a 1909 decision, for ‘concurrence of
wills’ or ‘unity of action and purpose’.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The usual phraseology employed
in many of the later cases is ‘common and joint purpose and design’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At times reference is made to ‘</span>previous
concert of criminal design’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
manifestation could be shown by ‘united and concerted action’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a conspiracy need not be proved by
direct evidence; it may be deducted from the mode and manner in which the
offense was perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conditions <span style="">attending its commission and the acts
executed may be indicative of a common design to accomplish a criminal purpose
and objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If to use the apt words
of Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, there is a ‘chain of </span>circumstances’
to that effect, the conspiracy has been established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If such be the case, the act of one is the
act of all the others involved and each is to be held to the same degree of
liability as the <span style="">others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, it has been our constant ruling from the
1905 decision of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mazu</span>.” (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pudpud</span>,
39 SCRA 618 [1971].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Quoted in People vs.
<span class="SpellE">Tiongson</span>, 47 </span>SCRA 279 <span style="">[1972]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Malilay</span>, 63 </span>SCRA
420 <span style="">[1975]; </span>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ogapay</span>, 66 <span style="">SCRA </span>209
<span style="">[1975]).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant faults the lower court in giving full credence to Abdul
<span class="SpellE">Manabilang’s</span> testimony which is “riddled with serious
doubts and improbabilities” and making it the basis of conviction (Appellant’s
Brief, p. 25).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows,
however, that <span class="SpellE">Manabilang’s</span> testimony as to
appellant’s participation in the plot is but corroborative of the individual
testimonies Dominic Simon and Esteban <span class="SpellE">Doruelo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guiamil</span> <span class="SpellE">Bari’s</span> extrajudicial
confession, all pointing to appellant as the person who masterminded the
victim’s abduction and demanded the payment of ransom for the girl’s release (<span class="SpellE">Appellee’s</span> Brief, p. 24).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s defense of alibi that a meeting could not have been
held in his house on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1982</st1:date>
regarding the plan to kidnap Deborah Simon because he was at that time in the
house of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Magabilen</span> cannot be given credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is a weak defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to be given full faith and credit,
it must be clearly established and must not leave any room for doubt as to its
plausibility and verity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
must show not only that he was not at the place where the crime was committed
but it was impossible for him to be there (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Albarillo</span>,
188 <span style="">SCRA </span>113 [July 30, 1990]
reiterating People vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuando</span>, 150 SCRA <span style="">3 </span>[May 26, 1987] and People vs. Lucas,
G.R. No. 80102, [January 22, 1990]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
found by the trial court, the distance between the house of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Magabilen</span> and appellant’s house is fifty (50) to one
hundred (100) meters and can be negotiated even by walking in a very short
period of five (5) minutes (CFI Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
161-162).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s contention that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred
in not granting his motion for new trial is likewise bereft of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a general rule a motion for new trial will
not be granted if based on an affidavit of recantation of a witness whose
effect, is to free the appellant from participation in the commission of the
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a dangerous rule to
reject the testimony taken before the court of justice simply because the
witness who has given it later on changed his mind for one reason or another,
for such a rule will make a solemn trial a mockery and place the investigation at
the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because affidavits of retraction can easily be secured from poor and
ignorant witnesses, usually for monetary consideration, the Court has
invariably regarded such affidavits as exceedingly unreliable (de Guzman vs.
IAC, 184 SCRA 128 [<st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1990</st1:date>]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it must be pointed out that of the five appellants,
four have withdrawn their appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
only herein appellant Pablo <span class="SpellE">Mangulabnan</span> who has taken
up the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that the
withdrawal of appeal by the co-accused shows acquiescence to the judgment of
conviction and an affirmation of the fact of the crime charged or a realization
that the evidence of the prosecution is overwhelming, and that of the defense,
weak in the extreme (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span>, <u>supra</u>.).</p>
