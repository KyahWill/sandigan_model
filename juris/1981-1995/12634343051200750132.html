				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case involves the application of the principle of <i>res
judicata</i> and the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies by a party
contesting the promotion to a higher position of a co-employee in the
Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS).</p>

<p class="BODY">The pleadings disclose the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to April 1982, petitioner and private respondent were the
Elementary Head Teacher and Elementary School Principal I, respectively in the
Schools Division of San Carlos City, Negros Occidental.  They were both considered for promotion to
the position of General Education Supervisor I (Music and Arts) in the said
Division when the same became vacant sometime in April 1982.  On 12 April 1982, the Division Promotion
Board decided in favor of the petitioner and recommended her appointment to the
said vacancy.  In September of 1982, the
Regional Promotion Board of Region VI of the then Ministry of Education,
Culture and Sports (MECS), now Department of Education, Culture and Sports
(DECS), to which the Schools Division of San Carlos City belongs, ruled in
favor of the petitioner; hence, the Regional Director decreed the petitioner's
appointment to the contested position.  Private respondent moved for its reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:346.5pt">On 21 November 1983, the Regional
Director reversed himself and declared the private respondent better qualified;
consequently, the latter was appointed to the contested position.  Petitioner appealed this adverse decision to
the then Minister of the MECS.  Because
of the delay in the disposition of her appeal, petitioner filed a petition for <i>Quo
Warranto</i> with <i>Mandamus</i> and Damages against the MECS Director of
Region VI, the Schools Division Superintendent of San Carlos City and the
private respondent with Branch 57 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of San
Carlos City.  The same was docketed as
Civil Case No. 076.  Upon motion of the
defendants, the court dismissed the case on the ground of prescription.  Petitioner moved for its
reconsideration.  During its pendency,
then Minister Jaime C. Laya of MECS wrote a letter, dated 17 April 1985, to the
Regional Director of Region VI transmitting to the latter the Memorandum-Report
of the Complaints Committee of the Ministry, dated 17 April 1985, which found
the decision of 21 November 1983 to be irregular and which recommended the
affirmance of the 23 September 1982 regional decision favoring the
petitioner.  Minister Laya also informed
said Regional Director therein of his (Laya's) concurrence with said findings
and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 May 1985, the MECS Regional Director, via a 1st
indorsement, directed the Schools Division Superintendent of San Carlos City,
Negros Occidental to prepare the appointment and other supporting papers of the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 23 October 1985, the trial court issued an Order denying
petitioner's 11 June 1985 motion for reconsideration on the ground that the
case had already become moot and academic in view of the aforementioned letter
of Minister Laya and the fact that pursuant thereto, the appointment of
petitioner had been prepared and that she had actually assumed the position.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, however, private respondent filed with this
Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary
injunction against Minister Laya, the Regional Director of MECS, Region VI, the
Schools Division Superintendent of San Carlos City and the petitioner.  The case was docketed as G.R. No.
73915.  Private respondent prayed
therein as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, petitioner most respectfully prays of the Honorable
Court to render judgment in his favor and against respondents, by declaring the
Memorandum-Report of MECS Complaints Committee, dated April 17, 1985, to the
Honorable MECS Minister (<u>Annex</u> <u style="text-underline:words">‘</u><u>N’</u>);
the letter also dated April 17, 1985 (<u>Annex</u> <u style="text-underline:
words">‘</u><u>N-1’</u>) of the Honorable MECS Minister to the MECS Regional
Director, Region VI, wherein the former concurred in the contents of Annex ‘N’;
and the letter of the Honorable MECS Minister, dated January 8, 1986 (<u>Annex</u>
<u style="text-underline:words">‘</u><u>X’</u>), addressed to the petitioner
wherein the latter is informed that his motion for reconsideration (Annex ‘Q’)
of the Memorandum-Report (Annex ‘N’), was denied, as null and void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u>
and without any legal force and effects (sic).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution of 11 June 1986, this Court dismissed the
petition for lack of merit.  This resolution
reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Considering the allegations, issues and arguments adduced in the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, the Court resolved to DISMISS
the petition for lack of merit.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion to reconsider it was denied with finality in the
Resolution of 8 April 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After his defeat in this Court, private respondent filed on 28
January 1988 with the RTC of San Carlos City a complaint for <i>Quo Warranto</i>
with Injunction and Damages<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
against the DECS Regional Director of Region VI, the Civil Service Commission
Regional Director of Region VI, the Schools Division Superintendent of San
Carlos City (Negros Occidental), the Administrative Officer of DECS, Region VII
and the petitioner.  Private respondent
prayed for judgment (a) annulling the 17 April 1985 Memorandum-Report of the
Complaints Committee of DECS, the letter of Minister Laya of the same date
expressing concurrence with the findings and recommendation therein and the
letter of the MECS Regional Director of 17 September 1985 directing the Schools
Division Superintendent to issue to the private respondent an appointment back
to his former position as Elementary School Principal I and (b) ordering
defendants therein to pay him P10,000.00 as attorney's fees, litigation
expenses and costs of the suit.  He also
sought the issuance of a restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent
the enforcement of the abovestated rulings and directives.  The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 162
and was assigned to Branch 57 of the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 February 1988, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss said
Civil Case No. 162 on grounds of (1) <i>res judicata</i>, invoking the said
court's order of 23 October 1985 in Civil Case No. 076 denying her motion for
reconsideration of the dismissal thereof on the ground that the same was
rendered moot by the abovementioned Memorandum-Report and letter of Minister
Laya both dated 17 April 1985, the subsequent appointment of the petitioner to
the contested position, her having assumed the same and the dismissal of G.R.
No. 73915; (2) prescription; and (3) lack of cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 April 1988, respondent Judge Mariano Basa, Jr. of Branch 58
of the court below handed down an Order denying the motion to dismiss.  Insofar as the first ground is concerned,
said court did not take into account G.R. No. 73915, but only Civil Case No.
076.  In disposing of the issue, it
ruled that the third requisite for <i>res judicata -- i.e.</i>, a judgment or
order on the merits in the first case -- is not present because Civil Case No.
076 was dismissed on the ground of prescription; the same was not decided on
the merits.  As to the second ground,
the trial court held that the private respondent's cause of action accrued only
after 23 September 1987 when the Schools Division Superintendent received the
MECS Regional Director's letter of 17 September 1987.  Anent the third ground, it ruled that the cause of action is very
clear from a reading of the complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to accept the order, which she impugns to have been issued
without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, petitioner filed this
special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
on 10 May 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court gave due course to the petition after the filing of
the Comment by the private respondent, the Reply thereto by the petitioner and
the rejoinder to the latter by the private respondent.  Both parties were then required to submit
their respective Memoranda,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> which
they subsequently complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Respondent Court could not have avoided the application of the
principle of <i>res judicata</i> if it did not disregard this Court's 11 June
1986 Resolution in G.R. No. 73915 denying the petition and the 8 April 1987
Resolution denying the motion for reconsideration with finality.  Although the former came in the form of a
minute resolution, it is an adjudication on the merits of the petition because
it was arrived at after a thorough evaluation of the facts alleged in the
petition, an incisive determination of the issues involved and an exhaustive
consideration of the arguments adduced therein.  This is a settled rule<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> which
the trial court should not have disregarded or ignored.  Accordingly, it may be pleaded, under the
principle of <i>res judicata</i>, to bar Civil Case No. 162 provided that the
other requisites therefor are present.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essential requisites of <i>res judicata</i> are:  (1) the former judgment must be final; (2)
it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject
matter and the parties; (3) it must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there
must be between the first and second actions identity of parties, identity of
subject matter and identity of causes of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties agree in their pleadings that the resolution of this
Court in G.R. No. 73915 had long attained finality before the institution of
Civil Case No. 162.  There can, as well,
be no doubt that this Court acquired jurisdiction over the former case, and
that the identities required under the fourth requisite of <i>res judicata</i>
obtain between said G.R. No. 73915 and Civil Case No. 162.  Accordingly, private respondent cannot be
allowed to re-litigate the causes of action or the issues he had raised in G.R.
No. 73915.  In <i>Legarda vs. Savellano,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“As we have repeatedly enunciated, public policy and sound practice
enshrine the fundamental principle upon which the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>
rests that parties ought not to be permitted to litigate the same issues more
than once.  It is a general rule common
to all civilized system (sic) of jurisprudence, that the solemn and deliberate
sentence of the law, pronounced by its appointed organs, upon a disputed fact
or a state of facts, should be regarded as a final and conclusive determination
of the question litigated, and should forever set the controversy at rest.  Indeed, it has been well said that this
maxim is more than a mere rule of law; more even than an important principle of
public policy; and that it is not too much to say that it is a fundamental
concept in the organization of every jural system.  Public policy and sound practice demand that, at the risk of
occasional errors, judgments of courts should become final at some definite
date fixed by law.  The very object for
which courts were constituted was to put an end to controversies.  (Zambales Academy, Inc. vs. Ciriaco
Villanueva, 28 SCRA 1; Peñalosa vs. Tuason, 22 Phil. 303)”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent and his counsel are equally guilty of
forum-shopping.  They tried to test what
appears to be the friendly waters of the trial court full of hope that they
could obtain a favorable verdict after having been spurned by this Court.  This is malpractice on the part of counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2. It is equally clear that private respondent had not exhausted
the administrative remedies provided by law to set aside the promotion extended
to the petitioner.  In this regard,
therefore, the complaint in Civil Case No. 162 fails to state a cause of
action.  A dismissal on the ground of
failure to exhaust administrative remedies is tantamount to a dismissal based
on lack of cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> What
private respondent should have done was to appeal the 17 April 1985 decision of
the then MECS Minister Jaime Laya to the Merit Systems Board (now Merit System
Protection Board).  Section 5 of P.D.
No. 1409 creating said Board provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 5.  <i>Powers and
Functions of the Board</i>. -- The Board shall have the following powers and
functions, among others:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">(2) Hear and decide

of appointing authorities involving appoint­ment, promotion, transfer, detail,
reassignment and other personnel actions, as well as complaints against any
officers in the government arising from abuses arising from personnel actions
of these officers or from violations of the merit system.”</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Pursuant to Section 8 thereof, the
Board's decision thereon may be appealed to the Civil Service Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Under present procedure, a next-in-rank employee who is competent
and qualified and feels aggrieved by the promotion of another may file a
protest with the department or agency head who shall render a decision thereon
within thirty (30) days from receipt of the protest.  Such decision may be appealed by an aggrieved party within
fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof to the Merit Systems Protection Board
which, in turn, shall render its decision thereon within sixty (60) days from
the time the case is submitted for decision.  The decision of the Board is final unless it involves a division chief
or an official of higher rank; in such a situation, the decision may be
appealed to the Civil Service Commission.  On the other hand, decisions involving positions below division chief
may be reviewed by the Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>
