<blockquote>"From the admissions in the pleadings of the parties, and the
evidence, testimonial and documentary, adduced by them during the trial, it has
been established that on June 20, 1977, the defendant entered into a purported
contract of lease (Exh. A; Exh. 1) with the plaintiff, wherein the latter
purportedly leased to the former one (1) unit motor vehicle; Make-Holden
Premier; Type-4DR.  Sedan; Model 1975;
Motor No. 19S-1172902; Serial No. 8 H69YFF-200875P, for a purported monthly
rental of P1,689.48, payable in advance on the 20th day of each month,
commencing on June 20, 1987, without the necessity of any previous demand or
notice; that rentals in arrears shall bear interest at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the </span>rate of 14% per annum; that upon the signing of said
contract, the defendant gave the plaintiff a guaranty deposit of P20,800.00 to
serve, among others, as security for the prompt and faithful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">performance </span>of his obligation (par. 2
complaint; par. 2, Answer); that the defendant defaulted in complying with the
terms and conditions of their agreement by failing to pay several monthly
installments stipulated therein (par. 3, Complaint; par. 3, Answer); that
because of such failure of the defendant to pay the said monthly installments,
the plaintiff sent a letter of demand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to
</span>the defendant, dated May 25, 1978, inviting his attention to his
outstanding balance of P6,889.64 including interest thereon, as of May 25,
1978, with warning that plaintiff would be filing the complaint against him on
May 30, 1978 if by that time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his </span>account
still remains unpaid or the personal property involved is not returned to
plaintiff in substantially the same condition as when he received it (Exh. C);
that, subsequently, another similar letter of demand was sent to the defendant
who received it on January 1, 1979, for payment of his outstanding balance of
P34,415.09, including <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">interest thereon </span>as
of January 2, 1979 (Exh. C-1); that, an earlier written letter of demand, dated
April 3, 1978, was also sent to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
received by, the </span>latter, inviting his failure to pay his monthly
installments for February and March, 1978, for which reason the plaintiff was
canceling their contract, making a final demand for the payment of P3,448.02
representing arrears in installment payments plus interest, and the return of
said automobile not later than April 5, 1978 (Exhs. D, D-1-a); that a similar
letter of demand and notice of cancellation of the contract for defendant's
failure to pay his monthly installments for December, 1978 and January, 1979,
was also earlier served on, and received by defendant<b> </b>on February 28,
1978 (Exhs. D-1, D-1-b); that defendant failed to pay various installments on
the date the same were due and demandable, compelling the plaintiff to file
this case against him."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>It further appears <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">that at </span>the
time of the execution of the contract on June 20, 1977, the defendant also
delivered to the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> plaintiff a guaranty
deposit of P20,800.00 "to serve as security for the prompt and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">faithful </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">performance of the obligations of the LESSEE.  The deposit shall be refunded to the LESSEE upon a satisfactory
termination of the Contract and shall not be applied to the rentals that may be
due during the entire </span>period of the Contract.  The LESSOR's determination of the LESSEE's liability or liabilities
to be charged against said deposit upon the expiration of the period of this
Contract shall be final and conclusive for all legal intents and purposes.  So far, the plaintiff has not proven during
the trial "the LESSEE's liability or liabilities to be charged against
said deposit" which did not even bear any interest.  In fact, plaintiff's sole witness Pedro M.
Fabien, Jr., was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">even </span>sure
of the meaning and scope of the term “guaranty deposit” (Testimony on cross?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">examination, June 16, 1983).  </span><u>In</u> <u>view thereof</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<u>and</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>credited</u> <u>in</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>his</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span><u>favor,</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>interest</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>of</u> <u>fairness,</u> <u>justice</u>
<u>and</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>equity.</u>  The plaintiff should not be allowed to
unduly enrich itself at the expense of the defendant.  (See also Article 19 and 22, New Civil Code).  This is even more compelling in this case
where although the transaction, on its face, appear ostensibly, to be a
contract of lease, it is actually a financing agreement, with the plaintiff
financing the purchase of defendant's automobile from the Automart
Corporation.  The Court is constrained,
in the interest of truth and justice, to go into this aspect of the transaction
between the plaintiff and the defendant in view of the <u>delivery</u> <u>receipt</u>,
dated <u>November</u> <u>4</u>, <u>1975</u>, presented in evidence by the
plaintiff in support of its complaint as its Exhibit "E", the
probative value of which has been submitted for the court's determination,
together with all the facts and circumstances existing in this case, and which
the court must consider in deciding the case, if it is to decide the case
according to all the facts.  For justice
can only be truly administered if it is based on the truth.  It is the Court's perception that the
plaintiff purchased the automobile involved herein for the sum of P54,000.00
from the Automart Corporation which delivered the same to him on November 4,
1975 (Exh. E).  On June 20, 1977, the
plaintiff and the defendant signed the purported contract of lease, using the
printed financing form of the plaintiff, but which transaction, according to
the existing facts and circumstances, was, actually, a financing scheme, with
the plaintiff as the financier, advancing the payment of defendant's
automobile, whereby the defendant on his part, agreed to pay to the plaintiff a
monthly installment of P1,689.48, the same to commence "from the date of
delivery of the Equipment to the LESSEE" up to the 36th month from said
delivery, which delivery of said car by the plaintiff to the defendant,
purportedly took place on June 20, 1977, for purposes of the financing scheme
or agreement, even as it appears from plaintiff's Exhibit "E" that
the automobile involved herein was actually already delivered by Automart
Corporation to the defendant who acknowledged receipt thereof way back on
November 4, 1975.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Considering that out of the
said beginning balance of P60,821.28, the defendant had already paid to the
plaintiff, in installments, the total amount of P41,670.59 as of July 8, 1979,
which amount, </span>if added to the aforementioned guaranty deposit of
P20,800.00 made by the defendant at the inception of the contract on June 20,
1977, would make a total payment of P62,470.59, it would appear that there is
even an overpayment of P1,649.31 made by the defendant, which the plaintiff

conclusion is that the private respondent did opt, as he has claimed, to
acquire the motor vehicle, justifying then the application of the guarantee

thereof.  We, therefore, see no
