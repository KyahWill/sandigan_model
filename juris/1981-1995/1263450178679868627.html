denied </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">defendants on the ground </span>that such
placards "containing the alleged writing were displayed during the strike
on April 3 and April 4, 1967 as a fair, legal labor strategy denouncing the
lack of business foresight, incompetence, mismanagement, arbitrary and despotic
acts of the Management to heed the legal and legitimate demands of the
defendants, as a striking union, and against whom a strike was declared against
the management of the Philippine National Bank"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and that moreover, "defendants, during the strike on April 3 to April 4,
1967, against the management of the Philippine National Bank, were only moved
by good intention and justifiable motives and did not intend to injure any
party not <span style="">connected </span>with the strike;"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
constituting part "of their legal and fair labor strategy to enforce their
demands" and to bolster their imputation of incompetence and arbitrariness
of the Philippine National Bank management.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The lower court sustained such a defense and dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision of the then
Judge <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Vasquez was to dismiss the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not discern any
libelous imputation in the alleged offending words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Such a ruling finds additional support
in the sympathetic approach followed by courts to inaccuracies and imprecision
in language in the use of placards as part of peaceful picketing in labor
controversies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts as found by the
lower court, admitted </span>by plaintiff-appellant as correct, follow:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1967" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1967</st1:date>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Philnabank</span>
Employees' Association (PEMA), a labor organization composed of the rank and
file employees of the Philippine National Bank, declared a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the said strike, which lasted up to
the following day, members of the PEMA paraded and displayed placards in front
of the PNB building at <span class="SpellE">Escolta</span>, <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>,
one of which contained the following words:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'PCIB BAD ACCOUNTS TRANSFERRED TO PNB-NIDC?' It is an admitted fact that
PCIB stands for plaintiff Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank, while PNB
refers to Philippine National Bank, and NIDC stands for National Investment
Development Corporation, a subsidiary of the PNB."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>To prove its claim for the recovery
of damages both actual and exemplary, as well as for attorney's fees, plaintiff-appellant,
as noted in the appealed decision, contended "that the writing on the
placard in question is a baseless and malicious aspersion that the plaintiff
was a party to a fraud, in that it was able to recoup on bad debts or other
uncollected accounts by fraudulent, questionable and immoral transfer thereof
to the PNB or NIDC."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Malice was likewise attributed to defendant labor union and its officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the decision went on to state:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Plaintiff presented evidence to show
that it is the largest 100% Filipino commercial bank in the Philippines; that
at the time of the filing of the complaint, it had twenty-seven (27) branches
all over the country and with foreign correspondent banks throughout the world;
that the assets of the plaintiff amounted to P333,417,445.05 and it handles a
quarterly volume of business amounting to P110,000,000.00; that it has several
big companies among its clients; and that it has a reputation for honesty,
reliability and trustworthiness, and has enjoyed domestic and international
prominence and goodwill."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
On that point, the lower court ruled:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The plaintiff has also miserably failed to prove any damage caused
to it by the supposed libelous placard subject matter of this action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff has admitted that its twenty-seven
branches at the time of the filing of the complaint (May 6, 1967) increased to
twenty-nine branches in August of 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defendants have shown that the number further increased to
thirty-three branches as of September, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">networth</span> likewise increased from
P46,000,000.00 in March, 1967 to P53,000,000.00 in August, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although plaintiff's witness <span class="SpellE">Jovino</span> Valenzuela testified that, after the display of the
questioned placard, the deposits of the plaintiff bank decreased, no record was
presented <span style="">to sustain this claim, which
is even inconsistent with the admission of the same witness that the Bank's <span class="SpellE">networth</span> increased since that time and has continued to
increase up to the time he testified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same thing is true with the testimony of plaintiff's witness <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> to the effect
that due to the placard in question his confidence in the plaintiff was shaken,
thereby causing him to deposit P50,000.00 with other banks instead of with the
PCIB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted more­over that, as an
exporter, it was safer to be opening accounts in several banks instead of in
only one."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As noted earlier, the
decision must be affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The brief presented by the <st1:city><st1:place>San Juan</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place>Africa</st1:place>, Gonzales and San Agustin Law Offices is noted
for its exhaustive and scholarly discussion of the law on libel relying on both
the Philippine and American authorities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the matter were viewed solely from what appeared in the placard,
there is an element of plausibility in the assertion that while it was aimed at
the Philippine National Bank, the way it was worded could reflect on a stranger
to the controversy, plaintiff Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable if there were an affront
to the sensibilities of its officials.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were right to guard its reputation earned after many years of
laudable and creditable performance in the field of banking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, precisely because of its
well-deserved reputation that what could at first glance be for the most fastidious
hurtful to its prestige could, if viewed with calmness and objectivity, be
considered, as it was characterized in the appealed decision, as lacking in
"libelous imputation."</p>

<p class="NUM">2. There <span style="">is, </span>as already indicated, another reinforcement to such a mode of
appraising the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a labor
controversy resulting in a strike, fortunately lasting only for one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The labor union made use, of its
constitutional right to picket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the
time of <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations, a
1947 decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court has been committed to the view <span style="">that
</span>peaceful picketing is part of the freedom <span style="">of speech guarantee of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latest case in point where such a
principle was reaffirmed expressly is Associated Labor Union v. Gomez,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> a 1980 decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no mention of the other placards </span>but
it <span style="">is not unlikely that to bolster its
claim, mention was likewise made and in bold letters at that of such alleged
failing of its management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the
aim and intent as found by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That could not very well be disputed by plaintiff-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the offending imputation, but
in the form of a question, was included.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was due to a former official of plaintiff-appellant's bank who was
thereafter named as President of the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should there be an automatic attitude of
condemnation for such incident?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
realistic observation of Justice Frankfurter in Milk Wagon Drivers Union of
Chicago v. <span class="SpellE">Meadowmoor</span> Dairies</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> be heeded that labor disputes give rise to
strong emotional response, then the decision reached by the lower court becomes
</span>even more <span style="">acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fact of industrial life, both in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> as in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">, that in the continuing confrontation
between labor and management, it is far from likely that the language employed
would be both courteous and polite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
being the case, there is no affront either to reason or to the law in the
complaint for libel being dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
placing reliance on the constitutional right of freedom of expression,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> this Court once again makes manifest its
adherence to the principle first announced by Justice Malcolm as </span><span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> <span style="">in
the leading case of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In no uncertain terms, it made clear that
the judiciary, in deciding suits for libel, must ascertain whether or not the
alleged offending words </span>may <span style="">be
embraced by the guarantees of free speech and free press.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be too often said that <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> was promulgated as far back as </span><st1:date year="1918" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8,
 1918</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A doctrine analogous in character was
enunciated by the United States Supreme Court only thirty-six years later in
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
