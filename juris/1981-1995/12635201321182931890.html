<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The

<p class="BODY">They sought admission as Filipino citizens on the basis of the
said certificates. The airport immigration officer referred their admission to
the board of special inquiry "to determine <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
and paternity to a Filipino citizen". He observed that the certificate
"is not conclu­sive evidence to establish the claim to Philippine citizen­ship"
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B and B-2).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the investigation conducted by the board, <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>,
Santos, Jose, Vicente and Felipe, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>,
and their alleged father, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>, testified.</p>

<p class="BODY">The board, composed of <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Hojilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gerundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Umengan</span> and Tomas G. <span class="SpellE">Montesines</span>,
in its decisions of June 23, and 26, 1961, concluded that those five persons
are Filipino citizens, being the children of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>,
a Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The board found that
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> was born on July 3, 1913 in <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> as the
illegitimate child of Maria <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> and an unnamed
Chinese father; that he is a Filipino citizen because he followed the
citizenship of his Filipino mother; that his Chinese natural father brought him
to China when he was four years old; that his Chinese father returned to the
Philippines and died here in 1920; that Antonio returned to this country in
1929; that he returned to China in 1931 and married a Chinese woman named <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> <span class="SpellE">Ty</span>;
that he cohabited with her up to 1938, and that out of their union, five
children, all boys, were born in Chi Bi, Amoy, China, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">namely: <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>,
Jose, Felipe, Vicente and Santos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The board allowed the
admission into this country of the five alleged <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>
brothers on the assumption that they are Filipinos under the principle of <u>jus
<span class="SpellE">sanguinis</span></u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two decisions were submitted to the individual members of the
Board of Commissioners of Immigration. On July 7, 1961 Commissioner Emilio L. <span class="SpellE">Galang</span> wrote on the two decisions the word
"Exclude" while Associate Commissioner Francisco de la Rosa wrote the
word "Noted". Associate Com­missioner Felix <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>
wrote on June 30, 1961 on the decision of June 23, 1961 the word
"Noted". He wrote the same word on July 3, 1961 on the decision dated
June 26, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three days later, or on July 10, 1961, the alien regis­tration
supervisor of the Bureau of Immigration issued to the five alleged <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> brothers identification certificates wherein it was
stated that they were admitted as Filipino ci­tizens on the basis of the
decisions of the board of special inquiry "duly affirmed by the majority
members of the Board of Commissioners".</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 24, 1962 the Secretary of Justice, acting in the
public interest, pursuant to section 79(C) of the Revised Administrative Code,
issued Memorandum Order No. 9. In that order, he directed that, in view of the
fact that "for the past several years, the Board of Commissioners of
Immigra­tion <u>has not met collectively</u> to discuss and deliberate on the
cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">coming </span>before it",
"all decisions purporting to have been rendered by the Board of
Commissioners on appeal from, or on review <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> of, decisions of the board <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of special inquiry" were "set
aside".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Secretary instructed the Board of Commissioners to review
"all decisions of the board of special inquiry ad­mitting entry of aliens
into this country and give preference to all cases where entry has been
permitted on the ground that the entrant is a citizen of the Philippines."</p>

<p class="BODY">He advised the board to apply the rule that the alien has the <u>onus
<span class="SpellE">probandi</span></u> of establishing that he is not subject
to exclusion and that, since "citizenship is a status of privilege, power
and honor of inestimable value", any doubt concerning its grant
"should be resolved in favor of the Government and against the
claimant" (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, L-24844, October 26,
1967, 21 SCRA 532; <span class="SpellE">Neria</span> vs. Commissioner of
Immigration, L-24800, May 27, 1968, 23 SCRA 806).</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the Secretary's directive, the Com­missioner
of Immigration ordered an immigration officer to study and review the
proceeding and the evidence as to the ad­mission of <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>,
Felipe, Vicente and Santos, all surnamed <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Caoile</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The immigration officer
conducted an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> investiga­tion
without notice to the said immigrants and without hearing them. He recommended
the reversal of the decision of the board of special inquiry dated June 23,
1961 (referring to <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>, Felipe, Santos and Vicente,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">all </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">surnamed <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Another immigration
officer, designated to review the case of Jose <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>,
failed to render a report. No further action was taken on Jose <span class="SpellE">Caoile's</span> case (covered by the de</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">cision of June 26, 1961).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">At the meeting on June
21, 1962 (within one year from the rendition of the decisions of the board of
special in­quiry), a new Board of Immigration Commissioners (composed of <span class="SpellE">Martiniano</span> P. Vivo, <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span> O. <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> N. Gaston)
acted on the report of the investigating officer. The Commissioners resolved to
exclude from this country <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>, Santos, Vicente and
Felipe, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>. Two days later, or on June
23, the Commissioners promulgated their de­cision, reversing the said decision
of the board of special inquiry and ordering the deportation of the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> four persons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The Board of
Commissioners found that the said persons were aliens not properly documented
for admission pursuant to section 29(a)(17) of the Immigration Law because they
had not proven that they are the children of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>.
The Commissioners, in refuting the conclusion of the board of spe­cial inquiry,
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Records of investigation show that although the claim to
Philippine citizenship of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>, alleged
father of applicants, is well-founded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(his
</span>birth and baptismal certificates show that he is the illegitimate child
of Maria <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>, Filipino), there is nothing in the same
records to indicate strongly and definitely that subjects are the real children
of the former.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The board of special inquiry relied so much on the blood
tests of applicants and their alleged father; the income tax returns of the
supposed father for the years 1953, 1958, 1959 and 1960; the statutory
declaration of one Chan <span class="SpellE">Wah</span> <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>;
and their own oral testimony.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In cases of similar nature, it has been held that blood tests
are not conclusive proof of relationship unless they are negative and
derogatory; income tax returns are self-serving and unreliable; statutory
declarations are in most cases biased and the <span class="SpellE">declarant</span>
is not available to be tested for cre<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">dibility;
and oral testimonies of applicants are similarly biased and self-serving."
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E-1).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On that same date, June
23, the Commissioner issued a warrant of exclusion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">against </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Teban</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On July 30, 1962 a copy of
the Commissioners' decision, attached to a covering letter, was sent by
ordinary mail </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to the said

warrant of exclusion was served on <span class="SpellE">Teban</span> <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>. He was arrested and detained at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>. Through Juan Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>
<span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> filed a petition for <u>habeas corpus</u> in

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The trial court opined
that Associate Commissioners De la Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>,
in placing the word "Noted" on the decision of the board of special
inquiry dated June 23, 1961, affirmed that decision. That opinion is not
correct. To "note" is not to approve. Moreover, the three
Commissioners did not convene as a body to deliberate on what action should be
taken on the decisions of June 23 and 26, 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As already pointed out,
Associate Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span> noted the decision of
June 23, 1961 on June 30, 1961 while Associate Commissioner De la Rosa noted it
on July 7, 1961. The separate notations on different dates clearly imply that
the Commissioners never held a meeting or session to resolve whether to affirm
or reverse the board's decision. There were no minutes of any such session or
meeting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Section 27(b)
contemplates that the Board of Commissioners should hold a meeting or session
if that body desires to review the decision of the board of special inquiry. Of
course, if </span>the board's decision is not reversed by the Board of
Commissioners acting as such within one year from its promulgation, it is
deemed affirmed and becomes final.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In this case, the
Commissioners a wanted to take action on the decision of the board of special
inquiry. Instead of holding a meeting, they took individual actions on it. That
mode of review is procedurally wrong and, therefore, void (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span>
vs. Vivo and Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Arca</span>, 21 SCRA 532), </span>quite
apart from Memorandum Order No. 9 of the Secretary of Justice expressly setting
it aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The legislative intention
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is that, as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">members of a board, the Commissioners
"should deliberate collectively </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">order that their
views and ideas should be exchanged and examined before reaching a
conclusion". The individual actions of the Commissioners on the decision
of the board of special inquiry are invalid because such disparate actions are contrary
to the purpose of constituting the Commissioners as a body to review the
board's decisions. (Ibid.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Consequently, the
ambiguous notation made by Commissioners De la Rosa and <span class="SpellE">Talabis</span>
on the decision of the board of special inquiry cannot be considered for
purposes of section 27(b) as an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the
board's decision. Notwithstanding that notation, the new Board of Commissioners
could validly review, as it did review, the said decision within one year from
its promulgation and set it aside. (See Wong Woo <span class="SpellE">Yiu</span>
vs. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Vivo, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">L-21076, March 31, 1965, 13 SCRA 552).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court speculated that the resolution of Commissioners
Vivo, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and Gaston dated June 23, 1962,
reversing the decision of the board of special inquiry was possibly antedated
because a copy thereof was mailed to the petitioners only on July 30, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">That speculation of the trial court is baseless and is belied by
the facts. It is a conjecture that contravenes the presumption that official
duty was regularly performed. The parties stipulated that on June 21, 1962, or
within one year from June 23, 1961 (the date of the decision of the board of
special inquiry) Commissioners Vivo, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and
Gaston met and voted to exclude <span class="SpellE">Teban</span>, Felipe, Santos
and Vicente, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
E, minutes of the meeting); that two days later, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">or </span>on June 23, the Commissioners promul­gated their written
decision excluding the said persons and setting aside the oft-mentioned
decision of the board of special inquiry (Exh. E-1); that, to implement that decision,
a warrant of exclusion was issued on that same date, June 23, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1962 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F); </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">that a copy of the decision, with a covering letter, was mailed to the
said persons on July 30, 1962.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, like the parties, was bound by the stipulated facts.
It could not substitute its conjectural <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">surmises
for those facts. Its judgment had to be based on those facts (Cabrera vs. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, 71 Phil. 182).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this Court had already held that "the operative
date of the Commissioners' action is that when the resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of exclusion was voted and adopted by them as
a Board, regardless of the date when the decision <u>in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span></u>
was prepared, written and signed" because "the decision <u>in <span class="SpellE">extenso</span></u> must relate back to the day when the resolution
to exclude was actually adopted. Necessarily, the extended opinion had to be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">posterior </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to the day when the Commissioners voted and resolved to reverse the
findings of the board of special inquiry." (<span class="SpellE">Arocha</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The trial court's
observation that petitioners <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span> were denied due
process because Commissioners Vivo, <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span> and Gaston
reviewed the decision of the board of special inquiry without notice to them
and without hearing them is not well-taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The law does not require
notice and hearing for such a review. The petitioners were already heard when
they presented their evidence before the board of special inquiry. A review by
the Commissioners of the board's decision is based on the evidence already
presented before the board. Hence, the immigrants seeking entry are not
entitled to another hearing. To quote Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes in <span class="SpellE">Arocha</span> vs. Vivo, <u>supra</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

surnamed <span class="SpellE">Caoile</span>. In arriving at that conclusion, the
Commissioners did not act with grave abuse of discretion. There is no showing
