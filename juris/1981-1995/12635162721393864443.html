				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On the night of 21 January 1985, at around eight o'clock, Honorato Laurio, Sr., was shot while preparing at home the soybeans he would use for sowing the following day in Sitio Malbug, Barangay Batuila, Baleno, Masbate.&nbsp; The victim's wife, Lourdes Rapsing, rushed to the kitchen, from where the direction of the gunfire had been heard, and there she saw her bloodied husband sprawled by the door.&nbsp; Just as she reached over to cuddle her husband, the latter remarked that Redentor Esquilona had shot him.&nbsp; She caught momentarily a glimpse of the man running away towards the creek at the back of their house <br><br>The victim's 9-year old son, Honorato Laurio, Jr., hurrying down the stairs at the sound of gunshot, had come face to face with Redentor Esquilona, who was holding a homemade gun called "Iantaka," before the latter fled towards the nearby creek. The lighted lamp and the evening moon enabled him to recognize Esquilona.<br><br>At around eleven o'clock that same evening, Honorato Laurio, Sr., succumbed to the two bullet wounds — one on his abdomen and the other on his breast —&nbsp; that he had sustained.<br><br>On 25 March 1985, an Information was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Masbate (Criminal Case No. 4703), Branch XLIV, charging Redentor Esquilona with Murder.&nbsp; The information read:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about January 21, 1985, in the evening thereof, at sitio Malbug, barangay Batuila, Municipality of Baleno, Province of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this court, the said accused with intent to kill, evident premeditation, treachery and with the use of a superior arm did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot with a homemade gun `lantaka' one Honorato Laurio y Manlapaz hitting the latter on the chest and abdomen, thereby inflicting wounds which directly caused his instantaneous death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>The accused pleaded "Not Guilty" to the charge.&nbsp; His testimony, as well as that of his witness Dominador Montilla, attempted to show that he and Montilla were having a drink at the latter's house, when they heard a gunfire, a common occurrence in the area, at or about the time of the shooting incident at the Laurio residence.&nbsp; The house of the accused is about 500 meters away from the Montilla dwelling and 400 meters from the victim's home.<br><br>On 09 March 1989, after a protracted trial, the Regional Trial Court rendered its decision finding accused Redentor Esquilona guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged and adjudging thusly:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, viewed from what transpired during the trial of this case, this court, being convinced of the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is being found guilty of the crime of MURDER, he is hereby sentence to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">RECLUSION PERPETUA</span> after considering that it was qualified with treachery and there being no mitigating circumstances.&nbsp; He is further ordered to pay the heirs of the victim in the amount of P30,000.00 as moral damages and to pay the costs of the suit.&nbsp; The detention of the accused before he was able to put up his bond for the temporary liberty is counted in his favor and shall serve the sentence at the National Penitentiary."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>In this appeal, the accused insists that the evidence against him is not enough and falls short of the <span style="font-style: italic;">quantum </span>of proof required to sustain a conviction.<br><br>That accused-appellant was the one responsible for the killing of Honorato Laurio Sr., could hardly be disputed.<br><br>We begin with the victim's own dying declaration testified to by the widow thusly:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">"Q. </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">At that time, do you know of any unusual incident that happened in your house? </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Yes, sir.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"Q. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">Please tell the court?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">"A. </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">That evening I was in our house . . . and my husband is in the kitchen cleaning the soybeans.

It is well-settled that courts have always looked upon this defense with caution, if not suspicion, not only because it is inherently unreliable but likewise because it is rather easy to fabricate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> For alibi to prosper, it would not be enough for the accused to prove that he has been elsewhere when the crime is committed but that he must further demonstrate that it would have been physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>We believe, however, that the trial court has erred in appreciating treachery and in having so considered it as an attendant circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Treachery cannot be presumed; it must, instead, be proven as fully as the crime itself.&nbsp; Here, we see no real proof to show that treacherous means have been employed by accused-appellant in committing the offense.<br><br>Accused-appellant committed the crime of homicide.&nbsp; There being neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances, the prescribed penalty under Article 249, in relation to Article 64, of the Revised Penal Code, is <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its medium period.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the penalty that can be imposed on accused-appellant is an indeterminate sentence of anywhere within the full range of <i>prision mayor</i>, as minimum, and <i>reclusion temporal</i> medium, as maximum.&nbsp; The award of indemnity should be increased to P50,000.00, in conformity with the prevailing policy.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of the trial court is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION.
