				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the decision of
the Court of Appeals which set aside the trial court's decision, dismissed
herein petitioner Leonora <span class="SpellE">Obaña's</span> complaint and
ordered her to pay Rafael G. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's fees with costs against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as stated in the Court of Appeals’ decision
are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Records show that defendant-appellant (Rafael G. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>) was the former counsel of Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and her minor children, Nicolas and Noel Patrick,
both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Torio</span>, in an intestate proceeding
docketed as No. 142 and in the petition for guardianship over said minors in
Sp. Proc. No. C - 00565.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1972</st1:date>, said
defendant-appellant as such <span class="GramE">counsel</span> in Sp. Proc. No.
C-00565, filed an "Explanation and Motion" for the approval of
attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defunct JDRC of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, acting on said motion, issued an order dated <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1972</st1:date>, the pertinent portion of
which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'Considering the foregoing, the Court believe that P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> attorney's fees is too burdensome the wards to
shoulder alone and that the guardian should be able to be responsible for half
of it.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'WHEREFORE, further to order dated April 11, 1972, counsel is
hereby authorized to collect P5,000.00, from the ward's guardianship
estate.'" <span class="GramE">(p. 3, Appellant's Brief).</span></p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1972</st1:date>,
appellant filed in the same proceedings a ‘Motion to Order the Guardian To Pay
The Attorney's Fees,’ with prayer that the guardian be ordered to pay
immediately the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> out of the ward's
guardianship estate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. W)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting</span> upon said motion, the JDRC of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City issued an order dated September 14, 1972,
requiring Liberty B. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to show proof of payment
of attorney's fees in accordance with Order of May 9, 1972 and to submit a new
guardian's bond releasing her former counsel as surety; failing which, she
shall be declared in contempt of court (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. X).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would appear that the above order was not complied with by
Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> because on November 9, 1972,
defendant-appellant Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>, filed with the
defunct CFI of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> an action for a sum of money
(Civil Case No. 4238-M) against said Liberty M. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Torio</span>, Jr. and Noel Patrick <span class="SpellE">Torio</span> (pp. 28, Record).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In his complaint, defendant?appellant averred among others: that
his attorney's fees in Sp. Proceedings Nos. C-412 and QC-00565 was (sic) not
paid by his former clients, despite repeated demands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In connection with said complaint, appellant
moved for the issuance of an order of attachment upon a certain parcel of land
covered by TCT No. 173792 together with the improvements belonging to Liberty
H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and her wards, located at 48 <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Damar</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

Leonora <span class="SpellE">Obaña</span> involving the attached property (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. S), the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City cancelled TCT No. 173792 in the name of Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and her wards, and, in lieu thereof, executed in favor of Leonora <span class="SpellE">Obaña</span> a new TCT No. 191059 necessarily transferring in the
process the encumbrance consisting of notice of levy in favor of appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 10, 1973, after summons by publication had been
effected in Civil Case No. 4238-M, upon motion of appellant Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>, the court declared the defendants therein, Liberty

plaintiff's evidence to be presented <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a decision was rendered on <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1973</st1:date>, awarding to

<blockquote>"Appellant then filed a petition in the then CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, for the
cancellation of TCT No. 191059 which was opposed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Leonora <span class="SpellE">Obaña</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1977</st1:date>,
said CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City in LRC-750 issued an order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> TCT No. 191059 and directing the Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> to issue a new title covering the
subject land in the name of Rafael G. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> married
to Victoria J. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To stop the registration of the subject land in the name of
appellant, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> filed an action on August 28,
1978 before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for annulment of judgment rendered in
Civil Case No. 4238-M.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her complaint,
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> as <span class="GramE">plaintiff,</span>
contended that the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 4238-M by the then CFI
of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> is null and void for the reason that said
court did not acquire jurisdiction over Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and her wards, since they were not properly served with summons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> also
claimed that the proceedings before the sheriff were defective in that the
sheriff failed to comply with the jurisdictional requirements on the manner of
service of notice in the New Rules of Court thus rendering the proceedings void
<span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendant-appellant, on the other hand, countered in his
answer that LRC-750 granting the petition for the cancellation of TCT No.
191059 in favor of said appellant is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the instant case; that plaintiff's
recourse under Rule 38 has long prescribed; that insofar as the plaintiff is
concerned, when she bought the property in question and title was transferred
to her on July 2, 1973, she is charged with knowledge of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case No. 4238-M thru the annotation at
the back of TCT No. 173792 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City; and that there was no extrinsic fraud committed by defendant-appellant
that may constitute a ground to nullify the judgment in Civil Case No. 4238-M.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in nullifying the judgment in
Civil Case No. 4238 held that no jurisdiction was acquired over the persons of
defendants therein, the action on being strictly <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>
and summons by publication is insufficient; and that no valid attachment and
levy were made by the sheriff as no personal service of the copy of the notice
to the occupant of the property was made."<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 37-40).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are, therefore, three cases which eventually led to this
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First was SP-C-00565, the
guardianship case before the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where the attorney's fees for <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> were initially awarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second was CC 4238-M before Branch VII of the
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court of First Instance where Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> filed his action or sum of money to collect his fees
and where a default judgment against Liberty <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Torio</span> children was rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third is the case now before us from the
Court of Appeals - Civil Case No. 5418-M, the annulment of judgment case filed
in Branch VIII of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
to set aside as null and void the CFI decision in Civil Case No. 4238-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is actually a fourth case, <span class="GramE">No</span>. LRC
750, a petition for cancellation of the petitioner's TCT No. 191059 filed by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> with the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal in Civil Case No. 5418 - M, the Court of Appeals
dismissed petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obaña's</span> complaint on the grounds
of lack of cause of action and <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raises the following assignment of errors, namely:</p>

<blockquote>"(T)hat the public respondent Court of Appeals committed a grave
abuse of discretion amounting to a lack of or in excess of jurisdiction, in
REVERSING and SETTING ASIDE, the appealed decision of the Trial Court a quo,
despite the clear merits thereof, and these errors of public respondent are
manifest in the following :</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THAT PETITIONER HAS NO
CAUSE OF ACTION, SINCE SHE WAS NOT A DEFENDANT NOR A PARTY IN INTEREST IN CC
NO. 4238-M (BRANCH VII, CFI, BULACAN):</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THAT THE COMPLAINT FOR
ANNULMENT OF DECISION IS BARRED FOR REASON OF RES JUDICATA, SINCE BETWEEN LRC-750
AND CC 5418-M, THERE IS AN IDENTITY OF PARTIES AND SUBJECT MATTER, AND CAUSES
OF ACTIONS." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 10-11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are certain facts overlooked by the Court of Appeals which
call for the setting aside of its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 4238 - M was an action for sum of money filed by
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> against Liberty <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and her minor children in an effort to collect attorney's fees in the
guardianship case he handled for them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The guardianship court authorized the payment of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the Court of Appeals, the
collection case was between <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> on one hand and <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and her children on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span class="SpellE">ruIed</span> that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obana</span>, the buyer of the lot, is not a
party in interest and had neither personality nor cause of action to ask for
the annulment of the judgment in that case.</p>

<p class="BODY">This may be so, if the facts end there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the judgment in Civil Case No.
4238-M, while against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and her children was
executed against property belonging to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obana</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The house and lot in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City which <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> sold to <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> for
P150,000.00 was executed upon by the Sheriff to satisfy the P10,000.00
attorney's fees in the <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> guardianship case and
another P5,000.00 awarded to<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> for his fees in prosecuting his own collection
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The house and lot were sold for
P17<span class="GramE">,402.90</span> to respondent <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the petitioner, the property she
purchased for P150<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1973</st1:date> is now worth over P1,000,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff's sale was <span class="GramE">effected</span> without
any personal notice to Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on the ground
that she had moved out of her old address and her "present address"
was unknown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No notice was served on <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> because she was not a party in the collection
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All notices and summonses in the
collection case filed on November 9, 1972 including the copy of the complaint,
the original summons, the alias summons, the notice of levy on attachment of
the disputed property, the notice of levy on execution and the notice of
sheriff's sale were served through mail to defendant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
at 34-H <span class="SpellE">Caingin</span> Road, Cypress Village, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
earlier stated, because the Sheriff could not serve the complaint and the
summons on <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who had moved out of the above
address, service by publication upon <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was
authorized by the court in the collection case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the annulment of judgment case which led to this petition, the
trial court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"On the question as to whether the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>
Court of First Instance had acquired jurisdiction over the defendants in the
civil case in question thru summons by publication, the latest case law on the
matter is to the effect that in an action strictly <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span> personal service of summons within the
forum is essential to the acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of the
defendant who does not voluntarily submit himself to the authority of the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, summons by
publication cannot -- consistently with the due process clause in the Bill of
Rights -- confer upon the court jurisdiction over said defendants (Magdalena
Estate, Inc. v. Nieto, et al. G R. No. 54242, November 25, 1983, citing
Citizens Surety &amp; Insurance, Inc. v. Judge <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Herrera, et al. 38 SCRA 369 [1971]; see also <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
v. Asuncion, 105 Phil, 761 [1059]; contra <span class="SpellE">Fontanillal</span>
v. Dominguez, 73 Phil. 579 [1042]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question that Civil Case No. 4238-M filed before the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> was a personal action
being one for the recovery of a sum of money as it prayed for judgment
‘ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay plaintiff the sum of
P10,000.00 with legal interest thereon from the date of the filing of this
complaint; the sum of P5,000.00 as attorney's fees plus actual, moral and
exemplary damages in such amounts as this Honorable Court may deem just and
equitable and the costs of suit.’ The creditor, however, in an action <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span> can take the recourse to locate
properties, real or personal of the resident defendant-debtor with unknown
address and causing said properties to be attached under Rule 57 of Section
1(f) in which case the attachment converts the action into a professional
proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span><u> </u>or <u>quasi-in-<span class="SpellE">rem</span></u> and the summons by publication may then be deemed
valid and effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid) In the case
at bar, it appears on record that the plaintiff who is supposed to be the
creditor availed of this remedy of attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This would have converted the action into a proceeding <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> and this rendered as proper the summons by
publication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But validity of the
attachment is now contested by the herein plaintiff on the ground that the
proceedings before the sheriff in connection with Civil Case No. 4238-M
especially the notice of levy of attachment of the property subject matter of
the action were defective and invalid not having been in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 57 of the Rules of Court on attachment." (pp. 27-29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Venturanza</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u> (156 SCRA 305, 312 [1987]), this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that the case at bar which is an action
for collection of a sum of money is an action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>
thereby requiring personal service of summons on the defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that Section 7 of Rule 57 requires that in
attaching real property a copy of the order, description, and <u>notice</u> <u>must</u>

court in the annulment case ruled that the attachment was void from the

converted into an action <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> where
service by publication would have been valid.</p>

<u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u> (G. R No. 78728, December 8, 1988) we stated that the
property of service of summons by publications is not dependent upon the
technical characterization of the action as one <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>
or <u>quasi</u> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span> but upon
compliance with the requirements for the situations found in Sections 16, 17,

</span>We declared the service of summons by publication as "legally and
constitutionally vitiated." In the present date, however, the action was
one <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>personam</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The service was equally void and of no
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court principally on the
ground that Leonora <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> was neither a defendant nor
a party-in-interest in the collection case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It ignored the fact that property already sold to her was attached and
then <span class="SpellE">bidded</span> out to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>
without any notice to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And because
the notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
in the collection case was secured ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> without
the defendant <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obana</span>, who were never brought to court, having any inkling
about it, the notice was not annotated on the owner's duplicate copy of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 173792.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span> cannot claim
ignorance of the sale to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> as a ground
for not bringing her into the picture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As stressed by the petitioner, Liberty <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
filed her motion for the approval of the sale of the disputed house and lot in
the guardianship case SP-C-00565 through her counsel, <u>herein</u> <u>private</u>
<u>respondent</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Suntay</u></span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">Q, original records).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could not have been unaware that the house and lot he was attaching
had been sold to <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> because the sale of the <span class="SpellE">Dalmar</span> property was authorized by the guardianship court in
the case where he was counsel for the guardian.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing circumstances, the order in LRC 750
which is based on irregular proceedings in the prior case and which directed
the cancellation of <span class="SpellE">Obana's</span> transfer certificate of
title cannot assume finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent court committed reversible error in using it as a basis for <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is the added factor that a land
registration court in a cancellation of title case could not possibly inquire
into the controversial matters raised in the annulment of judgment case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See Register of Deeds of
Iloilo v. Hodges, 7 SCRA 149 [1963]; <span class="SpellE">Sunpongco</span> v.
Heirs of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Ronquillo</span>, 36 SCRA 395 [1970] and
Development Bank of the Philippines v. Jimenez, 36 SCRA 426 [1976]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court ruled that Liberty H. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and her wards should have been joined as plaintiffs by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Obana</span> in the action to annul the judgment in the collection
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This ruling ignores the fact that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> could not even be summoned in the collection case;
her whereabouts are unknown; the judgment against her was a default judgment;
she has apparently no more interest whatsoever in the house and lot she sold to
<span class="SpellE">Obana</span>; and she still owes Atty. <span class="SpellE">Suntay</span>
P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And finally, in our capacity as a court of equity in addition to
being a court of law, we cannot close our eyes to the rank injustice whereby
the owner of a million peso house and lot is compelled to give up her property
to answer for a P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> attorney’s fee incurred by
its former owner and which the lawyer cannot apparently collect from his own
client.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision of the Court of
Appeals is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of the trial court in Civil Case No. 5418-M which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">"Premises considered, the judgment issued in Civil Case No.
4238-OM as well as the proceedings, orders and notices issued therein including
