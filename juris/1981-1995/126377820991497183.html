				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Two sets of informations&nbsp; were filed against the accused-appellant, namely:&nbsp; one set, consisting of five (5) informations docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-VII-2076, 2077, 2078, 2079, and 2080 for Murder, Frustrated Murder and Attempted Murder, in the Circuit Criminal Court of Pasig, Metro Manila; and, another set for Murder, Double Murder and Slight Physical Injuries, docketed as Criminal Case No. TG-439-77 in the Court of First Instance of Cavite.<br><br>All the aforementioned informations recited the same allegations covering the same incident.&nbsp; Thus on July 5, 1977, the accused filed an Urgent Motion to Dismiss Criminal Cases Nos. CCC-VII-2076, 2077, 2078, 2079, 2080 before the Circuit Criminal Court of Pasig on the ground that the Court of First Instance of Cavite had already acquired jurisdiction over the case (p. 27, Tsn.).&nbsp; On July 6, 1977, however, appellant pleaded not guilty in the five informations aforementioned and the said Circuit Criminal Court began trial of the cases on the merits.<br><br>On August 1, 1977, the appellant filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with the Supreme Court, docketed as G.R. No. L-46587, praying, among others, that a restraining order be issued against respondent judge of the Circuit Criminal Court of Pasig from proceeding with the joint trial of the subject five cases and from rendering a decision therein.<br><br>Pending resolution of the said petition, or on September 5, 1977, respondent judge rendered his decision in the five cases aforementioned convicting the appellant as charged and sentencing him to death.&nbsp; The decision is now before Us on automatic review.<br><br>The facts determined by the trial court are briefly as follows:<br><br>At about eleven o'clock in the evening of February 1, 1977, while Edgardo Bayani and Edilberto Bay were returning home from the wake of their deceased grandfather, they stopped on the street to listen to Rodolfo, Efraim, and Nolasco Villanueva who were telling stories with Isaias Bayani at the corner of Barrio Maymangga, Amadeo, Cavite, in front of Councilor Ambion's house.&nbsp; In the course of their conversation, the appellant suddenly arrived and hacked each of them with a bolo, about twenty centimeters long.&nbsp; The appellant first hacked Edgardo, who was hit on the left shoulder; then he turned to Edilberto, who was hit on the chest; the appellant next hacked Rodolfo, who was hit on the head, and Nolasco, who was hit in the face.&nbsp; Thereafter, the appellant turned to Isaias whom he fatally hacked on the neck.<br><br>The wounded victims identified the appellant as their co-farmer and townmate, who probably had a long-time grudge against their family (the Villanueva clan, of which Isaias was also a member), because Nolasco had been previously charged with a crime against chastity committed against appellant's sister.&nbsp; The victims claimed that because they were attacked by surprise they were unable to move from their respective positions.&nbsp; After the hacking incident, they did not notice where the accused fled.<br><br>The physicians who examined the victims testified, among other things, that the victims were confined in the hospital for the treatment of incise or hack wounds; that as a result of the incident, Nolasco's left eye had become blind and Rodolfo's speech had been impaired (p. 252, Tsn); and that Isaias' death resulted from the cutting of the carotid and jugular veins (p. 94, Tsn).<br><br>Pfc. Jose M. Leachon, a policeman of Amadeo, Cavite testified that at about 7:00 in the morning of February 2, 1977, Jeremias Villanueva and Councilor Ambion reported to the police a hacking incident; and that they immediately proceeded to the scene of the crime, together with a photo­grapher, and collected the following pieces of evidence:&nbsp; pictures of the dead body of Isaias and of bloodstains on the grass and the sahara tree (p. 216, Tsn.); Isaias' bloodstained clothes, offered as part of the corpus delicti of the crime; and strands of hair, probably belonging to Rodolfo, who was hacked on the head (p. 206, Tsn.).<br><br>The appellant, on the other hand, invoked self-defense, and presented a different account of the incident.&nbsp; Thus:<br><br>"That in the afternoon of February 1, 1977, he was at Barrio Maymangga, having come from Lalaan, after plow­ing the field.&nbsp; At around 10:30 in the evening, he saw Edilberto Bay and Edgardo Bayani at the corner of the barrio road and they invited him to a drinking spree.&nbsp; The appellant refused, whereupon Edilberto and Edgardo gave him a "sapok" and stoned him.&nbsp; The appellant parried the blows and asked why they were doing this to him, but the two pulled their "patalim" Sensing their plan to kill him, the appellant took the initiative to save his life and hacked them with his "bolo".&nbsp; Then, Rodolfo and Nolasco Villanueva, both armed with a piece of wood, together with Isaias Bayani, who was holding a chain, simultaneously launched at him.&nbsp; Isaias tried to beat him with the chain but he was able to hold Isaias' hand, so the chain did not touch his body.&nbsp; When he heard gunshots being fired by Romeo Bay, son of Edilberto, and saw Jeremias Villanueva at a distance, also holding a gun, he moved towards his sister's house and escaped.&nbsp; (p. 265-277, Tsn.).<br><br>Basically, the issue rests on credibility, and after a judicious perusal of the evidence on record, We find the prosecution's version deserving of more credence.<br><br>Appellant admitted that he hacked all the victims, but he invoked self-defense.&nbsp; To be worthy of credence, the same must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; On this point, the defense miserably failed.&nbsp; For instance, appellant testified on cross-examination:<br><br><table  ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">You want to impress the court, that there are two sharp pointed weapons, and two guns being fired?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The two men with weapons, and one with cadena who attacked you and you were not or you did not even suffer any injury at all?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">No, your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">And you did not have any weapon during the incident?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">None, your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">You, against five, and you left them all?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Because they were the ones who ran away, your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Answer the question?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, your Honor (Tsn, pp. 279-280)<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
