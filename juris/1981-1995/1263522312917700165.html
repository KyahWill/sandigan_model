Respondent Judge, presiding Branch XLIV of the Regional Trial Court in 
Dagupan City, had dismissed the case below for lack of jurisdiction and 
had denied reconsi­deration for lack of merit.
<p>
Petitioner, PLAINTIFF in the case below, is a corpo­ration engaged in 
the sale and repair of motor vehicles in Dagupan City. Private 
respondent, the DEFENDANT in the case below, was, or is, the sales 
manager of PLAINTIFF. Whether or not there was still a relationship of 
employer and employee between the parties when the complaint was filed 
is an unsettled question which need not be resolved in this instance.
</p><p>
Alleging that DEFENDANT was a former employee, PLAINTIFF had sued him, 
on March 22, 1983, for payment of accounts pleaded as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That during his incumbency as such the defendant caused and 
without authority from the plaintiff incurred accounts with the 
remaining balances in the total sum of P33,890.38 excluding interests, 
arising from </p>
  <p>
    the purchases of vehicles and parts,
      <br>
      repair jobs of his personal cars and
      <br>
      cash advances,
  </p>
  <p> faithful reproductions of the Vehicle Invoice, Debit Memos, Deed 
of Absolute Sale, Repair Orders, Charge In­voices, Vouchers, Promissory 
Notes, Acknowledgement Letter and Statement of Account, hereto attached 
and marked as Annexes 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 
'K', 'L', 'M', and 'N' respectively and the contents of which being 
herein additionally pleaded and made integral parts hereof;" 
(paragraphing supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his Answer, DEFENDANT denied
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x that he incurred any unpaid unauthorized accounts with the 
plaintiff in the total sum of P33,890.38 excluding interests therefor, 
and, <br>
    specifically denies under oath that the annexed Vehicle Invoice, 
Debits Memos, Deed of Absolute Sale, Repair Orders, Charge Invoices, 
Vouchers, Promissory Notes, Acknowledgement Letter and Statement of 
Account
      <br>
      have remained unpaid as in fact the truth of the matter is as follows, to wit:" (paragraphing supplied)
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
DEFENDANT further alleged in a counterclaim that he should still be 
considered an employee of PLAINTIFF inasmuch as there has been no 
application for clearance in regards to his separation.
</p><p>
At the pre-trial conference, the DEFENDANT raised the question of 
jurisdiction of the Court stating that PLAINTIFF's complaint arose out 
of employer-employee relationship, and he subsequently moved for 
dismissal. It was then when respondent Judge dismissed the case finding 
that the sum of money and damages sued upon arose from employer-employee
 relationship and that jurisdiction belonged to the Labor Arbiter and 
the NLRC.
</p><p>
Before the enactment of BP Blg. 227 on June 1, 1982, Labor Arbiters, 
under paragraph 5 of Article 217 of the Labor Code had jurisdiction over
 "all other cases arising from employer-employee relation, unless 
expressly excluded by this Code." Even then, the principle followed by 
this Court was that, although a controversy is between an employer and 
an employee, the Labor Arbiters have no juris­diction if the Labor Code 
is not involved. In Medina vs. Castro-Bartolome, 116 SCRA 597, 604, in 
negating jurisdic­tion of the Labor Arbiter, although the parties were 
an employer and two employees, Mr. Justice Abad Santos stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The pivotal question to Our mind is whether or not the Labor Code
 has any relevance to the reliefs sought by the plaintiffs. For if the 
Labor Code has no relevance, any discussion concerning the statutes 
amend­ing it and whether or not they have retroactive effect is 
unnecessary. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is obvious from the complaint that the plain­tiffs have not alleged 
any unfair labor practice. Theirs is a simple action for damages for 
tortious acts al­legedly committed by the defendants. Such being the 
case, the governing statute is the Civil Code and not the Labor Code. It
 results that the orders under review are based on a wrong premise."
</p><p>
And in Singapore Airlines Limited vs. Paño, 122 SCRA 671, 677, the following was said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Stated differently, petitioner seeks protection under the civil 
laws and claims no benefits under the Labor Code. The primary relief 
sought is for liquidated damages for breach of a contractual obligation.
 The other items demanded are not labor benefits demanded by workers 
generally taken cognizance of in labor disputes, such as payment of 
wages, overtime compensation or separation pay. The items claimed are 
the natural consequences flowing from breach of an obligation, 
intrinsically a civil dispute."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case below, PLAINTIFF had sued for monies loaned to DEFENDANT, 
the cost of repair jobs made on his personal cars, and for the purchase 
price of vehicles and parts sold to him. Those accounts have no 
relevance to the Labor Code. The cause of action was one under the civil
 laws, and it does not breach any provision of the Labor Code or the 
contract of employment of DEFENDANT. Hence, the civil courts, not the 
Labor Arbiters and the NLRC, should have jurisdiction.
</p><p>
BP Blg. 227 has amended Article 217 of the Labor Code to read as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ART. 217 - Jurisdiction of labor Arbiters and the Commission. - 
(a) The Labor Arbiters shall have the original and exclusive 
jurisdiction to hear and decide within thirty (30) working days after 
submission of the case by the parties for decision, the following cases 
involving all workers, whether agricultural or non-agricultural: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        1.    Unfair labor practice cases;
    </p>
    <p> 2.    Those that (<em>involve</em>) WORKERS MAY FILE INVOLVING wages, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment; </p>
    <p> 3.    All money claims of workers, including those based on 
non-payment or underpayment of wages, overtime compensation, separation 
pay and other benefits provided by law or appropriate agree­ment, except
 claims for employees compensation, social security, and maternity 
benefits; </p>
    <p>
        4.    Cases involving household services; and
    </p>
    <p>
        5.    CASES ARISING FROM ANY VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 265 OF THIS 
CODE, INCLUDING QUESTIONS INVOLVING THE LEGALITY OF STRIKES AND 
LOCKOUTS.
    </p>
    <p> [6.   <em>All other claims arising from employer-employee relations, unless expressly excluded by this Code</em>]." (Italics and bracketed portions indicate the deletions, while the amendments introduced are capitalized). </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The dismissal of the case below on the ground that the sum of money and 
damages sued upon arose from employer employee relationship was 
erroneous. Claims arising from employer-employee relations are now 
limited to those mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 217. There 
is no difficulty on our part in stating that those in the case below 
should not be faulted for not being aware of the last amendment to the 
frequently changing Labor Code.
</p><p>
The claim of DEFENDANT that he should still be consi­dered an employee 
of PLAINTIFF, because the latter has not sought clearance for his 
separation from the service, will not affect the jurisdiction of 
respondent Judge to resolve the complaint of PLAINTIFF. DEFENDANT could 
still be liable to PLAINTIFF for payment of the accounts sued for even 
if he remains an employee of PLAINTIFF.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the Petition is granted, and respondent Judge is hereby 
ordered to take cognizance of the case below and to render judgment 
therein accordingly.
</p><p>
No costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and<em> De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
