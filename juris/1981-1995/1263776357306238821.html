				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the decision of the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Sixth Judicial District, Branch XXX convicting defendants-appellants Manuel Navoa and Bernardo Lim of the crime of Arson.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds both accused Manuel Navoa y Martinez and Bernardo Lim y Ramirez, also known as Jack Robertson, Lim Ming Tak and Christopher Kelly, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of arson, as charged in the information, and hereby sentences them to suffer the penalty of death, to indemnify, jointly and severally, the building and theater owners, N. de la Merced &amp; Sons, Inc. and Universal Management Corporation, in the total amount of P774,550.29, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>In an information dated June 29, 1979, defendants-appellants Manuel Navoa and Bernardo Lim were charged with the crime of arson as follows:<br><blockquote>"The undersigned accused MANUEL NAVOA y MARTINEZ and BERNARDO LIM y RAMIREZ, alias 'Jack Robertson' alias 'Lim Ming Tak', alias 'Christopher Kelly' of the offense of Violation of Article 320, paragraph 4, in relation to Article 326-A, of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, (ARSON) committed as follows:<br><br>"That on or about July 9, 1978, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, conspiring and confederating together with others whose true names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown, and helping one another, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and deliberately, with the use of gasoline, set fire to and burn the MANILA CINEMA BUILDING, a commercial building where commodities of value were kept and which housed the Manila Cinema 1 and 2 Theatres, among others, located at the corner of Claro M. Recto Avenue and N. Reyes, Sr., St., this City, owned by the N. de la MERCED &amp; SONS, INC., and which build­ing was near and adjacent to other commercial buildings thereat, and therefore was a populated place, thereby causing as a consequence the said MANILA CINEMA BUILDING to be totally destroyed and burned, thus inflicting damage and destructions to the said building and its contents amounting to six (6) million pesos, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner thereof in the same sum of six (6) million pesos, Philippine currency; that as a further result thereof, the hereunder named persons sustained fatal injuries which were the direct cause of their death immediately thereafter:<br><blockquote>"1. Elmer Red Rebadavia, Lot 15, Blk. 86 Velvet St., SSS Village, Marikina, Rizal.<br><br>"2.&nbsp; Remedios C. Gayo, 204 Manila Times Village, Pamplona, Rizal.<br><br>"3.&nbsp; Gina Estela Montiel, 1709-B M. Hizon St., Sta.

Recto Avenue and Nicanor Reyes, Sr., Streets, Manila was burned, causing damage and destruction to the said building.&nbsp; In addition, fourteen (14) persons died in the fire, eleven of whom were identified.&nbsp; All died because of asphyxia due to suffocation (Exhs. "B", "B-1", "B-2", "B-3","C", "C-1", "C-2", "D", "D-1", "D-2", "E", "E-1", "E-2", "F", "F-1", "F-2" "G", "G-1", "G-2", "H", "H-1", "H-2", "I", "I-1", "I-2", "J", "J-1", "J-2", "K", "K-1", "K-2", "L", "L-1", "L-2", "M", "M-1" and "M-2").<br><br>N. de la Merced &amp; Sons, the owner of the Manila Cinema Building, and Universal Management Corporation, the owner of Manila Cinema 1 and 2 paid a total of P514, 068.29 as indemnification to heirs of the deceased to defray their funeral and hospitalization expenses and to those who survived the fire, of which P244,541.80 was reimbursed by the insurer, Filipino Merchants Insurance Co. (Exhs. "U-1" to "U-2").&nbsp; Damage to the building was estimated at P4,160,750.00 of which only P3,109,693.89 was paid by the insurer (Exhs "S", "S-1" and "T").<br><br>On June 29, 1979, defendant-appellant Bernardo Lim alias "Jack Robertson", alias Christopher Kelly", alias "Lim Ming Tak", acting as an alleged informer of Police Corporal Vicente Palmon and his fellow arson operatives, informed the latter that it was Manuel Navoa who was responsible for the fire that destroyed Manila Cinema 1 and 2.<br><br>Relying solely on the credibility of Bernardo Lim and without first securing a warrant of arrest, Corporals Palmon and Harrison Tolosa arrested appellant Manuel Navoa.&nbsp; At the police headquarters, appellant Navoa allegedly executed statements waiving his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel (Exh. "O") and giving an extra-judicial confession (Exhs. "A", "A-1" to "A-9").&nbsp; Both waiver and extra-judicial confession were subscribed and sworn to before Inquest Fiscal Zeus Abrogar.<br><br>Earlier, on that same day, appellant Bernardo Lim likewise executed a waiver of his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel (Exhs. "P" and "Q") and also gave an extra-judicial confession (Exhs. "R", "R-1" to "R-10").<br><br>On June 24, 1979, appellant Manuel Navoa made a re-enactment of how the theaters were set on fire during which, pictures were taken at various stages (Exhs. "N", "N-1" to "N-14").<br><br>Both defendants-appellants pleaded not guilty upon arraignment.<br><br>The testimony of appellant Bernardo Lim was sum­marized by the trial court as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x It was at 8:45 o'clock in the morning of June 22, 1979, that he was arrested by Corporal Palmon and brought to the police headquarters where upon instruction by a police investigator whom he only knew as Lito, he wrote in his own hand what purports to be a waiver of his constitutional rights (Exhibit P) and affixed his signature to what appears to be his statement naming and identifying his co-accused Navoa as the one who had set ablaze the two theaters in question and made the corrections therein (Exhibits R, R-1 to R-10) after being maltreated, dealt countless fist blows on the chest, tortured and threatened by said police investigator, which statement (Exhibits R, R-1 to R-10) was but prepared by Corporal Palmon without his participation.&nbsp; Told earlier that it was his right to be assisted by counsel, he said he needed none because anyway he was going to give his statement voluntarily."</blockquote>On the other hand, appellant Manuel Navoa's testimony is summarized as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x Between 7:00 and 7:15 o'clock in the morning of June 22, 1979, at the junction of Jose Abad Santos and Rizal Avenue Extension, as he was walking to take a ride to go to school, he was accosted by three police officers.&nbsp; Corporal Palmon poking a gun at him and Corporal Tolosa twisting his arm and handcuffing his two hands, they shoved him into a waiting jeep where a Chinese looking man was riding in.&nbsp; Taken to the police headquarters at United Nations Avenue in Manila, upon arrival he was first brought to the fingerprint section where after his handcuffs were removed he was made to fill up a form containing his personal data.&nbsp; After being fingerprinted, Corporal Palmon brought him to his office at the second floor of the building where upon being met by Corporal Tolosa he was divested of his bag containing books, notebooks, pencils, ball pens, school identification card and driver's license with P200 in cash kept inside his jacket.&nbsp; Except for the cash money, all were returned to him.&nbsp; Told by Corporal Palmon that he was responsible for the burning of the two theaters, he denied having anything to do with it, whereupon Corporal Tolosa told Corporal Palmon, 'Just leave it to me.' It is not true that he was informed of his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel.&nbsp; In fact they did not even allow him to get in touch with his relatives.&nbsp; For, when he tried to reach the telephone, Corporal Tolosa told him, 'Just try holding the phone and I will shoot you,' as he pointed a gun at him.&nbsp; Frightened, he did not attempt again to use the telephone.&nbsp; About the waiver, Exhibit O, Corporal Tolosa's companion wrote it on a piece of paper.&nbsp; After giving to Corporal Tolosa, it was given to him.&nbsp; With a ball pen handed to him, Corporal Tolosa told him to copy it on a typewriting paper, a gun being pointed by Corporal Tolosa on his right cheek.&nbsp; Frightened, he did as ordered.&nbsp; After that, Corporal Tolosa and his companion typed the statement (Exhibits A, A-1 to A-9).&nbsp; Except the portion beginning from his name on the first page (Exhibit A) until question and answer No. 17 on the third page (Exhibit A-2) everything on it is not true.&nbsp; After typing the statement, Corporal Tolosa disapproved of some words used and ordered him to make the corrections.&nbsp; When he told him that he needed the assistance of a lawyer, Corporal Tolosa ordered him to follow what he was told to do, otherwise he would get hurt or killed.&nbsp; Because of that he obeyed and made the corrections appearing on the fourth, seventh and tenth pages (Exhibits A-1, A-7 and A-9).&nbsp; Afterwards Corporal Tolosa ordered him to sign the statement, otherwise he would be tortured.&nbsp; Frightened, he did as he was told.&nbsp; Nothing was given him for lunch.&nbsp; And it was only in the morning of the next day, June 23, 1979, that he was given food while at the Theft and Robbery Section.&nbsp; When told by him that it was Kelly (accused Lim) alone who was responsible for having him arrested upon a false complaint, Corporal Tolosa boxed him twice on the chest.&nbsp; He never admitted anything to Corporal Palmon.&nbsp; But aside from what Corporal Tolosa did to him, Patrolman Julito Andales struck twice with his open palms his two ears, boxed him thrice on the chest and several times on the stomach and tied a piece of wire around his neck that he tightened and loosened slowly while he was at the Arson Section, being forced to give answers to the questions that would tally with his police report, such as the fact that it was not gasoline but a chemical that was used to burn the theaters, and that he was the one responsible for the burning of Delta Theater and Roman Cinerama and the fire in Tambunting and other places in Metro Manila.&nbsp; When first brought to the police headquarters, Corporal Palmon threatened to kill him, asking Corporal Tolosa if they should kill him.&nbsp; Then Corporal Palmon warned him that if he would not admit guilt to Corporal Tolosa he would return to kill him.&nbsp; Before being brought to the inquest fiscal, Corporal Tolosa told him to answer that what appears in his statement is his signature and that he was not tortured at all, if asked by the fiscal.&nbsp; About the alleged re-enactment in the pictures, Exhibits N, N-1 to N-14, he was but ordered by Corporal Tolosa and Patrolman Andales to pose for them while they were being taken.&nbsp; It was only in the morning of June 23, 1979, that his parents and relatives came.&nbsp; To them he revealed the threat he received and the torture he suffered from the police officers.&nbsp; A request was made by his mother to General James Barbers to have him undergo psychiatric examination so that he could also be physically examined by a doctor (Exhibit 3).&nbsp; It was in August 1976 at the Jai Alai that he came to know the accused Lim for the first time.&nbsp; Since then he used to extort money from him, P20, P30, P50, while in the company of people carrying guns.&nbsp; In March 1979, the accused Lim asked for P50,000 from him.&nbsp; Told that he could not give him that much, the accused Lim threatened to kidnap his younger sister and report him to the Philippine Constabulary as the one responsible for the murders, rapes, hold-ups and burnings in Metro Manila.&nbsp; But because of the threat that his parents and the members of his family would be killed one by one, his parents did not report it to the police authorities when he told them about it.<br><br>"Teresita Gutierrez, Edgardo Silva, Cristina de la Cruz and Glory Rabbon, accused Navoa's teachers at Gregorio Araneta University in Malabon, Metro Manila, swore to his presence in his classes on June 15, 16, 17 and 19 and July 8 and 10, 1978, as evidenced by their class records (Exhibits 1 &amp; 2-Navoa)."</blockquote>Solely on the basis of the extra-judicial confessions of both defendants-appellants (Exhibits "A", "A-1" to "A­-10", "R", "R-1" to "R-10"), the trial court rendered the appealed judgment of conviction.<br><br>Appellant Bernardo Lim now assigns the following errors:<br><br>The lower court erred in:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>CONVICTING APPELLANT BERNARDO LIM y RAMIREZ ON THE BASIS MERELY OF THE ALLEGED EXTRA-JUDICIAL CONFESSION (EXHIBITS "R" TO "R-10") OF THE SAME IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 20 ARTICLE IV OF THE 1973 CONSTITUTION.<br><br><center>II</center><br>CONVICTING APPELLANT BERNARDO LIM y RAMIREZ WITH THE CAPITAL PUNISHMENT OF DEATH WITHOUT PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br><center>III</center><br>NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ARREST OF APPELLANT BERNARDO LIM y RAMIREZ WITHOUT ANY WARRANT AFTER ONE YEAR FROM THE OCCURRENCE OF THE INCIDENT SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS APPEAL.<br><br><center>IV</center><br>DISREGARDING THE ALIBI OF APPELLANT BERNARDO LIM y RAMIREZ EVEN IF THERE WAS NO POSITIVE AND PROPER IDENTIFICATION OF THE ACCUSED BY WITNESSES OF THE PROSECUTION.<br><br><center>V</center><br>FAILING TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRE WAS THE RESULT OF AN ARSON OR AN ACCIDENT.</blockquote>On the other hand, appellant Manuel Navoa faults the trial court with the following errors:<br><br><center><i>FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</i></center><blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT ACCUSED-APPELLANT MANUEL NAVOA WAS ILLEGALLY AND ARBITRARILY ARRESTED ON JUNE 22, 1979.<br><br><center style="font-style: italic;">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</center><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN ADMITTING THE ALLEGED WAIVER (EXH.

It found no reason why the police officers should resort to torture "if only to have them (the accused) falsely charged and unjustly convicted of the serious crime of arson for which the penalty is death, fourteen people having perished in the fire that had been set ablaze." The court found the confessions replete with details; no complaints were filed against the police officers; and no doctors examined the accused for the alleged injuries.<br><br>On the basis of the above findings, accused Navoa and Lim were each sentenced to DEATH and ordered to pay P774,550.29 in indemnifications.<br><br>We first pass upon the question of whether or not the extrajudicial confessions were voluntary.<br><br>Even before the adoption of the "right to counsel" rule for custodial interrogations in Article IV, Section 20 of the 1973 Constitution, this Court had already ruled that to be valid, a confession must be shown to have proceeded from the free will of the person confessing.<br><br>Thus, in <i>People v. Bagasala</i> (39 SCRA 236), we stated that "where the confession is involuntary, being due to maltreatment, or induced by fear or intimidation, there is a violation of this constitutional provision.&nbsp; Any form of coercion, whether physical, mental or emotional thus stamps it with inadmissibility.&nbsp; What is essential for its validity is that it proceeds from the free will of the person confessing."<br><br>The test of free will does not require a showing of force or intimidation.&nbsp; On November 23, 1976, this Court ruled:<br><blockquote>"The constitutional inquiry is not whether the conduct of the police officers in obtaining the confession was shocking, but whether the confession was free and voluntary; that is, it must not be extracted by any sort of threats or violence, nor obtained by any direct or implied promises, nor by the exertion of improper influence.&nbsp; (People v. Alto, 26 SCRA 364) It has been recognized that 'coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.' (Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206, 4 L. Ed. 2d. 242)."</blockquote>In the light of the trial court's factual findings, it is difficult for this Court to make a categorical finding from the records that the police investigators resorted to cruel and reprehensible tactics to extort the confessions.&nbsp; However, we can glean enough to rule that, under the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, Navoa's confession was far from being the product of his free will.&nbsp; Assuming there was no torture, there was, at the very least, improper pressure and intimidation.<br><br>Appellant Navoa's testimony during trial alleges that he was intimidated into signing the confession (Exhibits "A", "A-1" to "A-9").&nbsp; He states:<br><br><table  ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td width="94%"> <div align="justify">After these personal items of yours were taken, what happened?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Corporal Tolosa told that I was the one responsible for the burning of Cinema 1 and 2.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What did you answer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I told him I don't know anything about it.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What did he do afterwards?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Corporal Palmon told Corporal Tolosa, 'Shall we kill him?'</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">(t.s.n., December 9, 1980, p. 5)<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="center">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q.</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">At that time, did they allow you to get in touch with any of your relatives?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">They did not.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Did you attempt to inform them you wanted to get in touch with your relatives?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">To whom did you make this request?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">To Tolosa.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was his answer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">When I tried to reach the tele­phone at the table of Tolosa, Tolosa suddenly pointed his gun at me and told me, 'Just try holding the telephone and I will shoot you.'<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What was your reaction?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"A.</td> <td> I became frightened after that."

The culpability of appellant Lim is intimately tied up with the truth of Navoa's confession and the community of criminal design between the two.&nbsp; Since we find a lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt to convict Navoa, we are constrained to acquit Lim for the same reason.<br><br>The intentional burning of two moviehouses which resulted in the death of fourteen (14) victims is shocking in the perversity of the minds which conceived it, in their senseless lack of concern for the sanctity of human life.&nbsp; By its very nature, the crime of arson is difficult to investigate.&nbsp; The crime itself usually destroys the evidence which would incriminate the perpetrators.&nbsp; For that very reason, however, the development of more sophisticated police techniques is imperative.<br><br>In this particular case, the police should have been more aware of the protections afforded by Article IV, Section 20 of the Bill of Rights to persons undergoing custodial interrogation.&nbsp; In the belief that the extra-judicial confession and the re-enactment, taken without the required constitutional safeguards, were enough to sustain conviction, determined efforts to apprehend the six other arsonists or to get admissible and more convincing evidence were no longer taken.<br><br>Section 20 of the Bill of Rights which provides:<br><blockquote>"No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.&nbsp; Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.&nbsp; No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.&nbsp; Any confession obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>governs the permissible procedures which the government may use in applying its power against individuals suspected of complicity in the commission of a crime.&nbsp; Without in any way minimizing the importance of giving police agencies ample latitude in the legitimate exercise of their duties, this Court is bound to give full and effective meaning to the public policy enunciated in Section 20, towards the creation of more effective safeguards against oppressive and arbitrary, albeit at times, well-meaning state power.<br><br>Not even the most conservative elements of society can deny that accused persons suffer an enormous disadvantage when confronted by the overwhelming interests of the State in public order, public safety, or its own self-preservation.&nbsp; The accused is at a disadvantage when government power and resources, coupled with the private motives of government officials are used against him.<br><br>The old argument that society's need for efficient law enforcement outweighs and, therefore, condones small encroachments on individual liberties has no place in a democratic form of government.<br><br>The continued acceptance of hitherto "valid" confessions to sustain judgments of conviction may lead to sloppy police investigations, to a lack of initiative, industry and resourcefulness on the part of the investigators, and to gross miscarriages of justice in many cases which must forever remain unknown.<span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span><br><br>In any balancing of interests, the scales will even out vis-a-vis government action only when there is an improvement of police procedures, the development of anti-crime techniques, and the perfection of law enforcement systems.&nbsp; And very often, such development of methods is possible only when the traditional, autho­ritarian, and easier procedures are proscribed and no longer available.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; Appellants Manuel Navoa and Bernardo Lim are ACQUITTED of the crime charged on grounds of reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, C.J., Feria, Yap, Fernan, Narvasa, Melencio-Herrera, Alampay, Cruz, </i>and <i>Paras, JJ., </i>concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</span> The <i>rollo</i> of this automatic review on appeal consists of four (4) thick volumes in addition to the original records of the trial court.&nbsp; Apparently, appellant Manuel Navoa spends considerable time inside the national peni­tentiary writing lengthy handwritten letters asseverating his innocence.&nbsp; Not all convicted persons inside Muntinglupa are as persistent in professing their cause.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, many of them do not have the necessary intelligence or education to overcome or even comprehend subjugation of the will, the coercion, and the psychological ploys inher­ent in custodial interrogations taken without constitutional safeguards.<br></div>
