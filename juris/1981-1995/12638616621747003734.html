the appellate court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
reversed the lower court findings on the ground that no evidence was presented

<p class="BODY">The city contends that <st1:street><st1:address>Perez Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>,
where the fatal drainage hole is located, is a national road that is not under
the control or supervision of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, no liability should attach to the
city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It submits that it is actually the
Ministry of Public Highways that has control or supervision through the Highway
Engineer which, by mere coincidence, is held concurrently by the same person
who is also the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After examination of the findings and conclusions of the trial
court and those of the appellate court, as well as the arguments presented by
the parties, we agree with those of the trial court and of the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this review on <i>certiorari</i>, we have simplified the
errors assigned by the petitioner to a single issue: whether or not control or
supervision over a national road by the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:place></st1:city> exists, in effect binding
the city to answer for damages in accordance with article 2189 of the Civil
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The liability of public corporations for damages arising from
injuries suffered by pedestrians from the defective condition of roads is
expressed in the Civil Code as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Article 2189. Provinces, cities and municipalities shall be liable
for damages for the death of, or injuries suffered by, any person by reason of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">defective condition of roads,
streets, bridges, public buildings, and other public works under their control
or supervision.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not even necessary for the defective road or street to
belong to the province, city, or municipality for liability to attach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The article only requires that either control
or supervision is exercised over the defective road or street.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, this control or supervision is provided for
in the charter of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> and is exercised through
the City Engineer who has the following duties:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 22. The City Engineer -- His powers, duties and compensation
-- There shall be a city engineer, who shall be in charge of the department of
Engineer<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ing and Public Works.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall receive a salary of not exceeding
three thousand pesos per annum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall
have the following duties:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(j) He shall have the care and custody of the public system of
water­works and sewers, and all sources of water supply, and shall control,
maintain and regulate the use of the same, in accordance with the ordinance
relating thereto; shall inspect and regulate the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">use of all private systems for supplying water to the city and its
inhabitants, and all private sewers, and their connection with the public sewer
system.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same charter of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> also
provides that the laying out, construction and improvement of streets, avenues
and alleys and sidewalks, and regulation of the use thereof, may be legislated
by the Municipal Board.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus the charter clearly indicates that the city indeed has supervision and
control over the sidewalk where the open drainage hole is located.</p>

<p class="BODY">The express provision in the charter holding the city not liable
for damages or injuries sustained by persons or property due to the failure of
any city officer to enforce the provisions of the charter, can not be used to
exempt the city, as in the case at bar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The charter only lays down general rules regulating the liability
of the city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand article
2189 applies in particular to the liability arising from "defective
streets, public buildings and other public works."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The City Engineer, Mr. Alfredo G. <span class="SpellE">Tangco</span>,
admits that he exercises control or supervision over the said road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the city can not be excused from
liability by the argument that the duty of the City Engineer to supervise or
control the said provincial road belongs more to his functions as an ex-officio
Highway Engineer of the <st1:street><st1:address>Ministry of Public Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
than as a city officer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>This is because
while he is entitled to an honorarium from the Ministry of Public Highways, his
salary from the city government substantially exceeds the honorarium.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo G. <span class="SpellE">Tangco</span> "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n his official capacity as City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>, as Ex-Officio Highway Engineer, as Ex-Officio City
Engineer of the Bureau of Public Works, and, last but not the least, as
Building Official for <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, receives the
following monthly compensation: P1,810.66 from <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
City; P200.00 from the Ministry of Public Highways; P100.00 from the Bureau of
Public Works and P500.00 by virtue of P.D. 1096, respectively.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This function of supervision over streets, public buildings, and other public
works pertaining to the City Engineer is coursed through a Maintenance Foreman
and a Maintenance Engineer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Although these last two officials are employees of the National Government,
they are detailed with the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and hence receive instruction and supervision from the city through the City
Engineer.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no doubt that the City Engineer exercises
control or supervision over the public works in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the liability of the city to the
petitioner under article 2189 of the Civil Code is clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be all that as it may, the actual damages awarded to the
petitioner in the amount of P10,000.00 should be reduced to the proven expenses
of P8,053.65 only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
should not have rounded off the amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In determining actual damages, the court can not rely on
"speculation, conjecture or guess work" as to the amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without the actual proof of loss, the award
of actual damages becomes erroneous.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, moral damages may be awarded even without
proof of pecuniary loss, inasmuch as the determination of the amount is discretionary
on the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Though incapable of pecuniary estimation, moral damages are in the nature of an
award to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered but which for some
reason can not be proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in
awarding moral damages, the following should be taken into consideration:</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Third, the award of moral damages must be predicated on any of
the cases enumerated in the Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Code.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the physical suffering and mental anguish
suffered by the petitioner were proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Witnesses from the petitioner's place of work testified to the
degeneration in her disposition -- from being jovial to depressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refrained from attending social and civic

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless the award of moral damages at P150,000.00 is

the moderating hand of the law is called for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

under preceding jurisprudence, the amount of moral damages should be reduced to

<p class="BODY">As for the award of exemplary damages, the trial court correctly
pointed out the basis:</p>

<blockquote>To serve as an example for the public good, it is high time that
the Court, through this case, should serve warning to the city or cities
concerned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to do more conscious of their
duty and responsibility to their constituents, especially when they are engaged
in construction work or when there are manholes on their sidewalks or streets
which are uncovered, to immediately cover the same, in order to minimize or
prevent accidents to the poor pedestrians.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Too often in the zeal to put up "public impact"
projects such as beautification drives, the end is more important than the
manner in which the work is carried out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because of this obsession for showing off, such trivial details as misplaced
flower pots betray the careless execution of the projects, causing public
inconvenience and inviting accidents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending appeal by the respondent City of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
from the trial court to the appellate court, the petitioner was able to secure
an order for garnishment of the funds of the City deposited with the Philippine
National Bank, from the then presiding judge, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Willelmo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
order for garnishment was revoked subsequently by the succeeding presiding
judge, Hon. Romeo D. <span class="SpellE">Magat</span>, and became the basis for
the petitioner's motion for reconsideration which was also denied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We rule that the execution of the judgment of the trial court
pending appeal was premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not
find any good reason to justify the issuance of an order of execution even
before the expiration of the time to appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

respondent Court of Appeals are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the decision
