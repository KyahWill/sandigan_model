Rizal, Quezon City, Atty. Filoteo T. Banzon sought recovery of attorney's fees
from Oliverio Laperal, Laperal Development Corporation, and Imperial
Development Corporation for professional services rendered by him in the
following cases:</p>

<blockquote>9.  Administrative action filed by the Solicitor

hectares of land.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10. Civil Case No.
Q-22933, Court of First Instance of Quezon City, Imperial Development Corp. vs.
P &amp; B Taxicab Inc..</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 8, 1983, the case was decided on the basis of a
Compromise Agreement reading in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Atty. Filoteo Banzon by this agreement, does hereby voluntarily and
freely waive, forfeit, or consider as fully <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">paid any and all other claims of money or otherwise that he may have
against the defendants, in all cases in the Philippines that he may have
handled for the defendants in the past, including whatever money claims he may
have in the above-entitled case outside of this agreement, inclusive of
representation fees, representation expenses, appearance fees, or retainers
fees, or other forms of attorneys fees, and he hereby re-affirm that he will
undertake upon his professional oath and standing, to protect the interest of
the defendants in all unfinished appealed cases that the herein plaintiff </span>had
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appeared in the past in representation
of the defendants, without any further renumeration or attorneys fees,
representation fees, appearance fees and expenses in connection therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 19, 1987, Banzon filed a complaint against Oliverio
Laperal, Laperal Development Corporation, Imperial Development Corporation,
Sunbeams Convenience Foods, Inc. and Vicente Acsay for:  1) the annulment of the aforequoted portion
of the Compromise Agreement; 2) the collection of attorney's fees for his
services in the cases of:  a) Imperial
Development Corporation vs. Añover, b) Republic vs. Sunbeams Convenience Foods,
Inc., <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., and c) Laperal Development vs. Ascario Tuazon and
Ascario Tuazon v. Judge Maglalang, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.; 3) the recovery of the
amount of P10,000.00 that was adjudged payable to him as attorney's fees by
Ascario Tuazon in Civil Case No. 3918; and 4) the payment to him of nominal
damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Docketed as Civil Case 50823 in Branch 92 of the Regional Trial
Court of Quezon City, this case was dismissed on the ground that the trial
court had no jurisdiction to annul the Compromise Agreement as approved by an
equal and coordinate court.  It was held
that the issue was cognizable by the Court of Appeals.  An additional ground was that the Compromise
Agreement already covered the plaintiff's professional services in the
aforementioned cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the decision was affirmed on the issue of
jurisdiction.  The Court of Appeals
held, however, that attorney's fees were due the private respondent in the
cases of Laperal Development Corporation v. Ascario Tuazon and Ascario Tuazon
v. Judge Maglalang and Republic v. Sunbeams Convenience Foods, Inc..<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are now before us to challenge the decision
insofar as it orders them to pay Banzon attorney's fees for his legal services
in the aforementioned cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">An examination of the
list of cases for which Banzon was suing for attorney's fees in Civil Case No.
Q-34907 shows that the case of Laperal Development Corporation v. Ascario
Tuazon was included therein although it was erroneously referred to as Civil
Case No. 4437.  Even if it was not
mentioned in the complaint, it was nevertheless covered by the Compromise
Agreement, where Atty. Banzon waived all other claims against the defendants</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">*</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> "in all
cases in the Philippines that he may have handled for the defendants in the
past, including whatever money claims he may have in the above-entitled case
outside of this agreement." He also undertook therein to protect the
interest of the defendants in all unfinished appealed cases where he appeared
in the past in representation of the latter, without any further remuneration
or attorney's fees, representation fees, appearance fees and expenses in
connection therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The undertaking clearly covered the case of Laperal Development
Corporation v. Ascario Tuazon, (AC-G.R. CV No. 70186), which was still pending
in the Court of Appeals at the time of the Compromise Agreement, and the
subsequent case of Ascario Tuazon v. Judge Maglalang (CA-GR SP No. 07370).  The respondent court erred in supposing that
the said agreement covered only past services, disregarding the clear
stipulation for the continuation of the private respondent's services in all
pending appealed cases in which he had earlier appeared.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the case of Republic vs. Sunbeams Convenience Foods,
Inc. (GR No. 50464), the Court of Appeals said:</p>

<blockquote>At the time of the execution of the compromise agreement and
rendition of the judgment based thereon on April 8, 1983, the aforementioned
case bearing G.R. No. 50464 was still pending in the Supreme Court.  It was not, however, the subject of the
compromise agreement (Exhibits C and 2; Annex 2, answer, pp. 47-55, 65-66,
rec.).  It could not have been so
because Sunbeams Convenience Foods, Inc. was not a party defendant in the
second amended complaint, although reference was made to it in the appellant's
seventh cause of action for which he has rendered professional services but for
which attorney's fees were being claimed from the herein appellee Oliverio
Laperal (Exhibits A and 1).  But nothing
is mentioned in the second amended complaint and in the compromise agreement
(Exhibits A and 1; C and 2) which would indicate that Sunbeams Convenience
Foods, Inc. itself was a party plaintiff therein or privy to the case.  Appellee Oliverio Laperal and Sunbeams
Convenience Foods, Inc. do not appear to be one and the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">It appearing that it was
the herein appellant who filed the brief for Sunbeams </span>Convenience <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Foods, </span>Inc. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">in the Supreme Court on March 14, 1980 (Exhibit D), he should be
compensated for his services.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Banzon's claim for attorney's fees <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in </span>the said case was also among those enumerated in his
complaint in Civil Case No. Q-34907 against Oliverio Laperal, Laperal
Development Corporation, and Imperial Development Corporation.  Notably, Sunbeams Convenience Foods, Inc.
(Sunbeams, for brevity), referred to in the complaint as "Mr. Laperal's
Corporation," was not joined by name as a party-defendant.  Apparently, the private respondent believed
that Oliverio Laperal, being the president of the said company, was directly
obligated to him for the attorney's fees due him for his handling of the case
for Sunbeams.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that a corporation is clothed with a personality
separate and distinct from that of the persons composing it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
It may not generally be held liable for the personal indebtedness of its
stockholders or those of the entities connected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">with it.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Conversely, </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">stockholder cannot be made </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">answer for any of </span>its financial obligations even if he should be
its president.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidence that Sunbeams and Laperal are one and the
same person.  While it is true that
Laperal is a stockholder, director and officer of Sunbeams, that status alone
does not make him answerable for the liabilities of the said corporation.  Such liabilities include Banzon's attorney's
fees for representing it in the case of Republic v. Sunbeams Convenience Foods,
Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sunbeams should have been joined as a party-defendant in order
that the judgment of the lower court could legally affect it.  But even if it was not impleaded, the court
could still validly proceed with the case because Sunbeams was not an
indispensable party but only a proper party.  A proper party is one which ought to be a party if complete relief is to
be accorded as between those already parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> A
party is indispensable if no final determination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">can be had of an </span>action unless it is joined either as plaintiff
or defendant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Compromise Agreement
upon which the decision of the court was based was between plaintiff Atty.
Banzon and the defendants represented by Oliverio Laperal.  To repeat, Sunbeams was not a party to this
agreement and so could not be affected by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is noted, however,
that in his complaint in Civil Case No. 50823 against Sunbeams <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,
Banzon stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.  On the 1st cause of action, to declare the
portions of the compromise agreement (annex A) alleged in par. 4 of the 1st
cause of action where plaintiff waives his attorney's fees and other fees in
all other cases he handled in the past for the defendants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Oliverio Laperal </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and his corporations not included in the
complaint</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for attorney's fee x x x   (emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This declaration amounted to an admission that he had also waived
his attorney's fees in the cases he had handled for Laperal's corporations
which were not impleaded in Civil Case Q-34907, including Sunbeams.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, in the hearing
Civil Case 50823, Banzon testified as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Atty.
Banzon  : I am not claiming my attorney's
fees from 1974 to 1981.  What I was
claiming was the attorney's fees for the services I have rendered after the
compromise agreement in 1983 to 1987 by virtue of the new <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agreement x x x.  (TSN, Sept. 15, 1988, p. 7 Records, Vol. II, p. 129).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

1987 by virtue of a new agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Atty. Banzon  : I admit, Your Honor that those 10 services are those services I
rendered in the past wherein I waived my attorney's fees; my services covered
from 1974 to 1981 but not my services after the compromise agreement.  (ibid, p. 22)</span><b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Sunbeams case was one of the ten cases listed in the
complaint in Civil Case No. 34907.  It
was pending before this Court when Civil Case No. Q-34907 and Civil Case No.
50823 were instituted.  To prove his
claim for attorney's fees for his services in the Sunbeams case, Banzon
submitted to the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 92,
"Petitioner's Brief" (Exh. "D") and "Petitioner's
Reply to Respondents' Brief" (Exh. "D-1") dated March 14, 1980
and August 12, 1980, respectively, which had earlier been filed with this Court
in connection with the said case.  Significantly, the preparation and filing of those pleadings were done
sometime in 1980, which means that they were among those ten cases referred to
by Atty. Banzon for which he had waived his attorney's fees.  There is no other proof of his services in
the said case after 1983 to 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's claim for attorney's fees in the
Sunbeams case was waived by him not by virtue of the Compromise Agreement to
which Sunbeams, not being a defendant in Civil Case No. Q-34907, could not have
been a party.  What militates against
his claim is his own judicial admission that he had waived his attorney's fees
for the cases he had handled from 1974 to 1981 for Oliverio Laperal and his
corporations, including those not impleaded in his complaint in Civil Case No.
Q-34907.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is GRANTED.  The decision of the respondent court dated
November 21, 1990 is MODIFIED.  Petitioners
Laperal Development Corporation and Sunbeams Convenience Foods, Inc. are
declared no longer liable to the private respondent for attorney's fees in
AC-GR CV No. 70186, CA-GR SP No. 07370 and GR No. 50464.  Costs against the private respondent.</p>
