				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">The issue in </span>this
petition is whether or not a judgment creditor who bought at a public auction,
a land covered by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>free patent,
can recover possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">thereof </span>from
another buyer to whom <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>same
was conveyed by the grantee and judgment debtor, in violation of Section 118 of
CA 141, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">On </span>April 15, 1967,
Daniel Junco was granted by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>President
of the Philippines homestead patent no. 255492 over a parcel of land known as
lot numbers 4 and 5, Psu-117884 of the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Basay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, with a total area of 72,941 square
meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without knowing said issuance, he conveyed by way of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a deed of sale dated </span><st1:date year="1967" day="16" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 16,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, 7,500 square
meters of the </span>lots <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to herein
private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1968, he
received information of the issuance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
registered the patent only on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">December 19, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, and he was issued by the Register of Deeds
of the province, OCT No. 7936 covering the same </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">lots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, on the other hand, registered the deed of
sale but he was never issued any title thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His grandfather, however, paid the real estate taxes of the portion sold
to him up to 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1974</st1:date>, the entire lots
were sold at a public auction held by the provincial sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter on that same day, executed in
favor of petitioner Juan <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> as judgment creditor
and being the highest bidder thereat, a certificate of sale and subsequently,
OCT No. 7936 was cancelled and TCT No. 1300 was issued to petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since he bought the lots, petitioner had been
in possession thereof except the portion sold to private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner made demands from private
respondent for the surrender of the portion sold to him but he refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then filed with the then Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental an action for
recovery of possession docketed as Civil Case No. 5966 against private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's evidence consisted mainly of TCT No. FV-1300 issued
to him by the Registry of Deeds and the testimony of his daughter Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Sala</span> <span class="SpellE">Napigkit</span> who declared that
they have advised private respondent to vacate the area sold to him but he
refused and that they have never harvested the fruits from the 130 coconut
trees thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For private respondent,
his evidence was the deed of sale executed in his favor by Daniel Junco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial on the merits, the trial court
rendered a decision dismissing petitioner's complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

In so ruling, the trial court relied on the decision of this Court in <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Trading v. <span class="SpellE">Macam</span>,
L-18497, <st1:date year="1965" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1965</st1:date>, 4
SCRA 179.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the Court held
and this the trial court reiterated:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
where one of two conflicting sales of a piece of land executed before the land
was registered, while the other one was an execution sale in favor of the
judgment creditor of the owner made after the same property had been
registered, what should determine the issue are the provisions of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">last paragraph of Sec. 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court to the effect
that, upon the execution </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">delivery of the final certificate of sale in
favor of the purchaser </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">land sold in an execution sale, such

<p class="BODY">In addition, it considered private respondent a buyer in good
faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, it said that the
auction sale where petitioner was buyer was on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1974</st1:date> while the sale to the private respondent
by Daniel Junco was on <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It reasoned out that the patent was issued on
April 15, 1967 and the prohibition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>alienate
or encumber under Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 is within 5 years
from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">date o</span>f issuance of the
patent but the above <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">section </span>of
Commonwealth Act No. 141 makes no "reference to a buyer in good faith like
the defendant who has no knowledge as to when his seller was granted a patent
upon whom devolves the strict observance of" said section, hence,
concluded that "the sale by Daniel Junco to defendant Crispin <span class="SpellE">Salveron</span> is VALID."</p>

<blockquote>(p. 21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that the sale made by Daniel Junco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>private respondent is void by
reason of Sec. 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended and so private
respondent never acquired any right over the land subject thereof; that
respondent court's theory of equity and private respondent being a buyer in
good faith is erroneous because Section 118 does not exempt patentees and their
purported transferees who had no knowledge of the issuance of the patent from
the prohibition against alienation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner further asserts that our ruling in <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
Trading Co., v. <span class="SpellE">Macam</span>, <u>supra</u>, is not
applicable because in that case, there were two valid sales – one, executed
before the land was registered; and the other, an execution sale after the land
was registered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the land
involved therein presumably was not covered by a patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the
other hand, maintains that respondent court correctly applied our pronouncement
in the above cited case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 118 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended by
Commonwealth Act No. 456, provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Except in favor of the Government or any of its branches,
units or institutions, lands acquired under free patent or homestead <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">provisions </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">shall </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">not be subject to
encumbrance or alienation from the date of the approval of the application and
for a term of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">five </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">years from and after the date of issuance of
the patent or grant nor shall they become liable to the satisfaction of any
debt contracted prior to the expiration of said period, but the improvement or
crops on the land may be mortgaged or pledged to qualified persons,
associations, or corporations." (p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As was held in several cases, the prohibition has the avowed
purpose of giving the homesteader or patentee every chance to preserve for
himself and his family the land that the State had gratuitously given him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>a reward for his labor in cleaning and
cultivating it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prohibition to alienate commences to run from the date the
application <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>approved which may
be a date earlier than the date of issuance of the patent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The period of five years <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">within </span>which the alienation or
encumbrance of a homestead is restricted, starts to be computed from the latter
date.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is not disputed that the sale made by the
grantee, Daniel Junco to private respondent, of the 7,500 square meters portion
of lots 4 and 5, was made barely one month and eleven days from the issuance of
the patent to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale was,
therefore, null and void and without effect because it was in violation of the
above provision of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The nullity of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">sale </span>of only a portion of the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">lots, </span>extended <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>the entire lots.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The sale produced the effect of annulment and cancellation of the title issued
to Daniel Junco and causes the reversion of the lots and its improvements to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>State (Sec. 124, CA 141, as
amended).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the sheriff’s sale
was conducted after five years from the issuance of the patent and that
petitioner, although in good faith, was subsequently issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">title </span>over lots 4 and 5, the
proceedings had did not cure the nullity of the first sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision against alienation is mandatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, where a grantee is found not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">entitled </span>to hold and possess in fee
simple the land, by reason of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> his </span>having
violated Section 118 of the Public Land Law, the Court may properly order its <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to the grantor, although the property has already
been brought under the operation of the Torrens System.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, this right of the government to bring an
appropriate action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> (or reversion) is
not barred by the lapse of time; the Statute of Limitations does not run
against the State.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The principle of conclusiveness of title, though sound, as
applied to lands registered under the Land Registration Act through judicial
proceedings, cannot defeat the express policy of the State prohibiting the
alienation or encumbrance of lands of the public domain acquired under the
provision of the Public Land Act within five years from and after the date of
the patent.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The reliance placed by respondent court on the case of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Trading Co., v. <span class="SpellE">Macam</span>, <u>supra</u>,
is erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The land involved therein is
not covered by a free patent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED
insofar as it dismissed the complaint for recovery of possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of the decision be furnished the
Office of the Solicitor General for appropriate action.</p>
