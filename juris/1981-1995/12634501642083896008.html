<p class="BODY" style="">Subsequently, or on <st1:date year="1959" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1959</st1:date>, the same guardian
Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> filed a second petition in the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, praying for authority to sell Lots Nos. 632 and 633 on the
following ground, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"That in view of the standing account of the estate of the
insane, Leonora <span class="SpellE">Yuson</span> and the expenses for
maintenance of her children, the herein petitioner deems it wise that the
above-mentioned property, which the estate cannot maintain or improve, be
sold." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, p. 2.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">However, the true area
of the two lots — i.e., eleven (11) instead of only one and one-half (1-1/2)
hectares — was disclosed in this petition, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"That among the properties of the insane, Leonora Navarro, <span style="">as </span>inheritance from the deceased
spouses, Enrique Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonleon</span>, are two (2) parcels of land known <span style="">as </span>Lots Nos. 632 and 633 Cad. <span class="GramE">102, <u><span style="">consisting of 11

<p class="BODY" style="">On the same day that this second
petition was filed, Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> also filed a
"Motion to Approve Sale of Property" because Lots Nos. 632 and 633
had in the meantime been already <span style="">sold by her to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
San </span>Agustin the day before, i.e., on January 19, 1959, as evidenced by
an instrument 'titled "Transfer of Rights", that is to say,
simultaneously with the other deed which was duly authorized and approved by
the court.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">Acting on this second motion, on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1959</st1:date>, the Court denied the
petition to sell Lots Nos. 632 and 633, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Inasmuch as the judicial guardian sold just recently Lot No.
634-A, TCT No. 1296, belonging to the ward, in the amount of Thirteen Thousand Seven
Hundred Fifty Pesos (P13<span class="GramE">,750.00</span>), the sale of the
property mentioned in her petition filed on January 20, 1959, <span style="">is </span>not <span style="">necessary or would </span>not be beneficial
to the ward; hence, <span style="">the </span>petition
to sell is hereby denied." (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>,
pp, 26-27)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Meanwhile, because the co-heirs of the
ward, Leonora Navarro — namely, Benita Navarro, <span style="">Delia </span>Navarro and Ramon Navarro, in
aforementioned Special Case No. 64-R learned thru the sale by appellant
guardian Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> to Dr. San Agustin that <span style="">Lots Nos. 632 and 633 consisted not merely of
1.5 hectares but 11, steps were taken towards the return of the said properties
and they were correspondingly returned to the estate for proper disposition,
and as a result, a Supplemental Project of Partition dated June </span>9, <span style="">1960 was arrived at, submitted to the court
but subsequently amended on July 29, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The amended Supplemental Project of Partition was also approved by the

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">The
record does not disclose the lower court's action on this "Amended Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither does it appear there that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
ever took any step to enforce the sale to him of the two lots in question
evidently because, as he very well knew, the Court had disapproved the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellant on page 11
of her brief, it was only after she filed a civil action, docketed as Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">5160,</span> seeking the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of the said lots that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> began to move by
filing on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1966</span></st1:date><span style=""> a "Motion for Confirmation of Deed of

. . in the interest of justice and equity . . . the Transfer of Rights over
Lots 632 and 633 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> San Agustin
be approved and confirmed by the Honorable Court." He based his alleged
right over the two lots on the "Supplemental Project of Partition" of
June 9, 1960 and the "Amendment to the Supplemental Project of
Partition" of July 29, 1960, which were executed by the Judicial
Administrator and by the heirs, respectively, and approved by the probate court
in the intestate proceeding, to modify, as already stated earlier, the original
Project of Partition because of the discovery of the true area of Lots Nos. 632
and 633, which is eleven (11) hectares and not one and one-half (1.5) hectares
only, and that all the heirs agreed in said "Supplemental Project of
Partition" and the amendment thereto, among other things, to recognize and
confirm the sale of </span>Lots Nos. 632 and 633 in his favor, instead of
partitioning the same in some other manner.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">On <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1966</st1:date>, Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>

<p class="BODY" style="">Her motion for reconsideration having
been denied "for lack of merit, "the judicial guardian, Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>, is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> and urges
the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>THE ORDER OF THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
APPROVING THE TRANSFER OF RIGHTS IN FAVOR OF JUSTINIANO SAN AGUSTIN IS CONTRARY
TO LAW ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS:</blockquote>

IN SETTING ASIDE ITS ORDER DATED <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">FEBRUARY
 7, 1959</st1:date> IS CONTRARY TO LAW ON THE GROUND THAT IT SETS ASIDE AN
ORDER WHICH HAS BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">In support of the first assigned
error, judicial guardian-appellant Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> argues
through counsel that the transfer of rights is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span></u> and cannot be approved nor confirmed,
because under Rule 95, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court, property under guardianship
can be sold only by prior authority granted by the guardianship court; that in
the instant case "not only was the transfer of rights executed by the
judicial guardian without any authority, but the petition seeking authority to
sell, which was filed a day after the actual execution of the transfer of
rights, was expressly denied by the lower court"; and, therefore, the
transfer of rights is void because "a sale of the ward's realty by the
guardian without authority from the court is void", citing <span class="SpellE">Inton</span> v. Quintana, (81 Phil. 97).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, she adds that the transfer of
rights is <span class="GramE">not necessary nor</span> beneficial to the
ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is no allegation at
all to such effect in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> motion for
confirmation.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Relative to the second assigned error,
judicial guardian-appellant argues that the Order of the lower court of
February 7, 1959, which denied her petition to sell Lots 632 and 633 completely
disposed of her petition and, therefore, the challenged Order of November 12,
1966, which summarily set aside the said previous order is contrary to law.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">The
foregoing assignment of errors/arguments raise only one decisive issue, which
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not, under the circumstances
related above, the lower court acted correctly in issuing the order of November
12, 1966, approving the Motion for Confirmation of Sale of Lots 632 and 633
filed by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Dr. San Agustin and setting
aside its previous order of February 7, 1959, which earlier disapproved the
sale of the same lots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">We agree with appellant that the
impugned order cannot stand legal scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">To start with, it must be emphasized
that what <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> asked the court to confirm was a
sale in 1959, or seven years <span style="">before the
filing of said motion, and what is more, it was a sale which the court refused
to authorize in its order of February 7, 1959, for the simple reason that in
its opinion, considering that a previous sale of Lot 634-A for P13,750.00 had
just been approved, it could not see why it would again be
"necessary", after just a few days, "or beneficial to the
ward" that the two lots, Lots 632 and 633 should still </span>be <span style="">sold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span class="SpellE">Reiteratedly</span>,
this Court has ruled that under Sections 2 and 3 of Rule 96 (now Rule 95) that
the properties of Leonora, the ward of appellant Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>
could be sold only under authority of the guardianship court in Special
Proceedings No. 282.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such
authority, any sale would necessarily be illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, even on the assumption posited by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> that the lack of authority from the guardianship
court resulted only in a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> sale which could be
<span class="GramE">ratified,</span> there is no showing in the record that there
was any such ratification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot go
along with the proposition that the approval by the probate court in Case No.
64-R of the amended "Supplemental Project of Partition" may be deemed
in law as tantamount to the required ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">It is quite true that
appellant-guardian Mrs. de <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>, did sign, assisted by
her lawyer, Atty. Pedro S. Castillo, the motion to approve said
"Supplemental Project of Partition" of July 29, 1960, and that said
motion was approved by the probate court on August 29, 1960.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is further true that in the first
"Supplemental Project of Partition" it was specifically stipulated in
paragraph 7(a) "that this Estate shall recognize and confirm the
conveyance of the rights over said Lots Nos. 632 and 633, Cad. 102, with an
area of 11 hectares, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> San
Agustin, for the stipulated price of P8<span class="GramE">,250.00</span>."
But legally speaking, the approval by the probate court of such project of
partition (the stipulation just quoted was specifically reiterated in the
amended project dated July 29, 1960), did not in any degree confer upon Mrs. de
<span class="SpellE">Pua</span> the power to dispose of the lots in question
without prior permission of the guardianship court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the motion to approve referred to was
signed only by <span class="SpellE">Flor</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Unson</span>,
the Judicial Administrator in the probate court in Case No. 64-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that that court had no jurisdiction
to authorize the sale of any property belonging to an heir who is under
guardianship without first requiring the guardian to secure the corresponding
authority from the guardianship court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, much less could the probate court have any power to effectively
approve a sale of an heir-ward which had, as in this case, been actually
disapproved by the guardianship <span class="GramE">court.</span></p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">In
arriving at this conclusion, We are not overlooking the fact that the same
judge, the Honorable Vicente N. <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span>, Jr. who had
issued the order denying authority to sell Lots 632 and 633 </span>was the very
one who in his order of November 12, 1966, here being assailed, approved the
motion for confirmation on the lame excuse, <span style="">as We see it, that his previous order of February 7, 1959 was
"based on erroneous facts".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What "erroneous facts", he did not state, which circumstance readily
places the order in question subject to the omission to comply with the
constitutional requirement that final orders or decisions of courts of record
should state the facts on which it is based, which means, of course, that at
least the main elemental facts must be stated in a manner such as to enable the
parties to comprehend intelligently what they are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Another equally important
consideration lies in the way to <span class="GramE">Our</span> giving Our
sanction to the questioned order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
order of <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1959</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Cusi</span> held the sale was neither necessary nor
beneficial to the ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for
confirmation of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> of <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1966</st1:date> had no allegation at all that
could induce anyone to alter the conclusion in the <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1959</st1:date> order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If indeed there was already need on the part of the ward Leonora for
additional funds in 1966, the court could not just assume that such was the
case, absent any allegation, much less any proof to such effect before it.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Besides, We cannot but wonder how Lot
634-A with an area of a little less than nine (9) hectares was sold for
P13,750.00 and yet two lots, numbered 632 and 633, indicating they must be
either contiguous to Lot 634-A or within its immediate vicinity could be sold
on the same day for only P8,250.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
guardianship court is designed purposely to see to it that the interests of
wards under its jurisdiction are taken care of by the court's appointed
guardian with the diligence and prudence of a <u>bonus <span class="SpellE">pater</span>
<span class="SpellE">familiae</span></u><i>.</i><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are not convinced that such standard of care was observed in the
impugned order of <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">We
hold that appellant had every right to require </span>the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">reconveyance</span></span><span style=""> by deed of said lots, without prejudice to
her returning to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the P7<span class="GramE">,375.00</span>
he appears to have paid, but not before <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> San
Agustin has accounted for the fruits of the lots in question which have
remained in his possession since 1959 and a proper set-off of the amount of any
possible additional payment has been determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby
rendered setting aside the impugned order of <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1966</st1:date>, and ordering the guardianship court in
Case No. 282 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
Branch I, to proceed with the accounting pursuant to the above opinion.</p>

P13,750, while in the deed denominated "Transfer of Rights", Lots 632
and 633 were sold to him for P8,250 of which the sum of P7,375 was paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 634-A
was authorized by the lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1958" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That sale was approved in the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the lower court in its order of February 7, 1959
denied the petition to sell <u>Lots 632 and 633</u> on the ground that the sale
was not necessary and that it would not be beneficial to the ward because on
that same day, <u>January 19, 1959</u>, the guardian, as stated above, sold to
San Agustin <u>Lot 634-A</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it should be stated that in the <u>intestate
proceeding</u> for the settlement of the estates of the spouses, Enrique
Navarro and <span class="SpellE">Maximina</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonleon</span>,
Lots 632 and 633 were adjudicated in the project of partition to the
incompetent, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Yuson</span>, on the assumption that the
area of the two lots was only <u>one and a half hectares</u> with a value of
three hundred pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">When in the <u>guardianship <span class="GramE">proceeding</span></u>
it was discovered that the correct area of the two lots was <u>eleven hectares</u>,
a supplemental project of partition dated <st1:date year="1960" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1960</st1:date> and an amendment thereto dated <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1960</st1:date> were filed in the <u>intestate
proceeding</u> with respect to Lots 632 and 633.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was clarified therein that the sale of the
two lots to San Agustin should be respected but the estate of the ward should
pay P1<span class="GramE">,200</span> to her coheirs as consideration for the
transfer of their interests in the two lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, as a probate court, approved the amended
supplemental project of partition in its order of <st1:date year="1960" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1960</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, notwithstanding the probate court's confirmation of the
sale to San Agustin, the guardian, Mrs. De <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>, filed
two years later, or on August 21, 1962, in the guardianship proceeding a motion
wherein she manifested her desire to return to San Agustin the sum of P7<span class="GramE">,375</span> which he had advanced to her for the sale of Lots 632
and 633.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court, as a guardianship court, in its order of <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1962</st1:date> granted her motion
in order to enable her to recover the possession of the two lots from San
Agustin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show
whether that order was implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of that order, San Agustin filed four years later or on <st1:date year="1966" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1966</st1:date> a motion for the
confirmation of the deed of transfer of rights covering Lots 632 and 633,
which, as already stated, was executed in his favor by Mrs. De <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="1"><u>January
 19, 1959</u></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He based his
motion for confirmation on the amended supplemental project of partition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. De <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>, the guardian, opposed that
motion on <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She invoked the lower court's orders of <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1959</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1962" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1962</st1:date> denying her motion
for authority to sell Lots 632 and 633 to San Agustin and allowing her to
rescind the sale by returning the sum of P7<span class="GramE">,375</span> to San
Agustin.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that same date, <st1:date year="1966" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1966</st1:date>, the lower court overruled the opposition, set aside its
order of <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1959</st1:date>
and granted the motion for confirmation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the order under appeal in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court erred in setting aside its 1959 order
disapproving the sale of the two lots to San Agustin and in confirming the same
sale seven years later or in 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be recalled that the lower court in its 1962 order,
which had not been set aside, authorized Mrs. De <span class="SpellE">Pua</span>,
the guardian, <u>to return the price of the two lots</u> to San Agustin or to
rescind the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In issuing that order,
the lower court presumably acted on the theory that the sale was not beneficial
to the ward's estate since <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 634-A, an eight-hectare
land located in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, had already been sold to San
Agustin on <st1:date year="1959" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1959</st1:date>
or on the same day that Lots 632 and 633 were also sold to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the lower court in its 1966 order had not made any
finding that the sale of the two lots would redound to the benefit of the ward
or her estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> that sale in 1959,
the <u>lower</u> court, as a guardianship court, if it desired to reopen the
matter in <u>1966</u>, should have followed the requirements of sections 2 and
3 of Rule 96, now Rule 95, regarding the sale of the real property belonging to
the ward.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 requires that the guardianship court should issue an
order directing the next of kin of the ward and all persons interested in the
ward's estate to appear at a reasonable time and place to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why the sale should not be allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 requires the guardianship court to hold a hearing and
hear the proofs and allegations of the petitioner, the ward's next of kin and
the other interested persons as to whether the sale would be for the best
interest of the ward.</p>

<p class="BODY">The anomaly herein is that the guardianship court in 1966 approved
a sale made in 1959 by the guardian for which there was no prior authority or
license given to the guardian, which the court had in fact <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span>
and whose rescission, at the instance of the guardian, was sanctioned by the
court, and which sale the guardian later on opposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale, as confirmed, was, in effect, a
sale made by the court and not by the guardian.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is odd for the guardianship court to confirm in 1966 a sale
made by the guardian in 1959 which the guardian later repudiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unorthodox procedure followed by the
court is in contravention of Rule 96, now Rule 95, and is not within the
Contemplation thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote for the setting aside of the lower court's order of
November 12, 1966 and to order San Agustin to accept the sum of P7,375, to
account for the fruits of the two lots and to return the possession thereof to
the guardian.</p>
