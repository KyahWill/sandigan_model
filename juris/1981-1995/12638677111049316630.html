decision of the Regional <span style="">Trial </span>Court
of La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, convicting them of selling
marijuana in violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act and sentencing each <span style="">of them to life imprisonment and a fine of

<p class="BODY">The lower court found that the accused were apprehended as a
result of a buy-bust operation conducted by a NARCOM team on <st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1984">June 11, 1984</st1:date>, near the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype>

<p class="BODY">The team was composed of five persons, with Patrolwoman Mercedes
Garcia acting as the poseur/buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
other team members were P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. Elmer Mariano, P/Cpl.
Eduardo Garcia, P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, and P/Sgt. Murphy <span class="SpellE">Bugtong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of them testified for the prosecution. </p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The evidence of the
People showed that, having been previously informed that there was somebody
looking for a buyer of marijuana, the team went with the informer </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">search of the alleged pusher at his residence near the public </span>market
in <span style="">La Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The informer talked to the prospective
seller, who arranged to meet the buyer after lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Returning at </span><st1:time hour="14" minute="0"><span style="">two o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> that same afternoon, the </span>team failed
to talk to the suspect, but they tried again at <st1:time hour="17" minute="0"><span style="">5 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
was when Garcia finally met the first of the accused-appellants, who was
introduced to her as Daniel </span><span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the rest of the team followed unobtrusively, <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span> led Garcia and the informant to a vacant lot near
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three were joined a few minutes later by
Andy <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span> who, after a brief conversation with <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span>, went to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three then proceeded to a waiting shed in
front of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span style="">Agricultural</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">College</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
<span class="SpellE">Tonis</span> returned at about </span><st1:time hour="18" minute="0"><span style="">6 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="">, he asked that the sale be made near the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Capitol</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Building</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, but Garcia refused, insisting that it be
made right where </span>they <span style="">were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Tonis</span>
left <span style="">again </span>and returned after
fifteen minutes carrying a plastic bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was accompanied by <span style="">Julio <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>, who was carrying a straw bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> suggested
that the sale be made at the vacant lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After examining the contents of the bag carried by <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>,
</span>Garcia agreed and walked with the sellers to the said lot.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the way, Garcia placed her hand in her pocket - the
pre-arranged signal to the other team members that the suspects were carrying
marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other policemen then
pounced upon the sellers and after a brief scuffle and <span style="">chase were able to apprehend them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two bags were confiscated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The suspects were taken to the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City
Police Station for investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plastic
bag was found to contain 2.7 kilos, and the straw bag 1 kilo, of what were
later subjected to a field test and found to be marijuana leaves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above incident was narrated by Garcia and the other team
members, who corroborated each other's testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
P/Lt. Carlos <span class="SpellE">Figuerroa</span>, a forensic chemist of the PC
Crime Laboratory, affirmed the results of the thin layer chromatography and <span class="SpellE">doquenis</span> <span class="SpellE">levine</span> tests he had <span style="">conducted showing that the specimens taken
from the bags <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>
were carrying were positive for marijuana.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The marijuana leaves were produced in court
and offered as exhibits.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the prosecution had rested, <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span>
filed a demurrer to the evidence, which was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was thus deemed to have waived his right
to present his defense, <span style="">conformably to
the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> For their part, <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> testified that the bags taken from them
belonged to one Benny, who had asked them </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">carry the bags for
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While walking on the road toward
Campo Filipino, they were arrested by some men riding in a jeep, but Benny
escaped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claimed they were mauled
while under detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both denied they
had conspired with each other or with <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span> to
commit the crime imputed to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> pleaded the additional circumstance of minority,
stressing that he </span>was less <span style="">than
eighteen years old at the time of the alleged offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other witnesses were presented by the
defense.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In convicting all three accused-appellants, the trial court
disbelieved the account of the mysterious Benny as the real owner of the
marijuana found <span style="">in </span>their
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that the facts
established showed that the three <span style="">of </span>them
were acting in concert, with <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span> <span style="">negotiating the deal </span>with <span style="">Garcia, then ordering <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span>
and, through him, <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>, to get the marijuana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the three accused-appellants performed
their respective roles in the consummation of the sale to Garcia, from the
moment <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span> offered to sell the marijuana to her
until the time <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>,
at <span class="SpellE">Mangusan’s</span> bidding, produced the marijuana that
was to be the subject of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obvious that after the informer had approached <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span>
and they agreed to meet later after lunch, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Mangusan</span></span><span style=""> </span>contacted <span class="SpellE">Tonis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> and asked them
to make ready the marijuana they were going to sell later that same day to
Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conspiracy existed among them
because, to use the language of the law, they came to <span style="">an </span>agreement concerning the commission of the felony and decided <span style="">to </span>commit it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants make much of the fact that no money was
presented in evidence as the consideration for the alleged sale and conclude <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that no sale <span style="">in </span>fact took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lack of such evidence did not disprove the sale in light of the positive
testimony of Garcia that she offered to buy and <span class="SpellE">Mangusan</span>
agreed to sell <span style="">the marijuana and that
the sale did actually take place </span><span style="">as
</span><span style="">also testified to by the other
prosecution witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the alleged inconsistencies in the testimonies of the
said witnesses, the Court reiterates the rule that minor disagreements among
witnesses do not necessarily reflect on their veracity if their individual
narrations are essentially consistent with each other in the important
details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution version of the
commission of the crime is believable as a whole, particularly as it is
supported by the real evidence of the marijuana confiscated from the
accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By contrast, their
explanation that the marijuana belonged to the mysterious Benny, who merely
asked them to carry the bags for him, strains credibility and imagination, more
so since Benny seems to have disappeared into thin air and has never been seen
again. </p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that in the course of the trial of this case, <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> withdrew his original plea of not guilty and
substituted it with guilty with the assistance of his counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that same date, he filed an application
for suspension of sentence and commitment of youthful offender under P.D. 603
as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when it was pointed out
by the trial court that his application could not be granted because the crime
charged against him was punishable with life imprisonment, he decided to
withdraw his guilty plea and to reiterate his original plea of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was allowed by the trial court without
objection from the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now suggested in the People's brief that although <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span> could not avail himself of a suspension of
sentence because of the life imprisonment imposed upon him, he should
nevertheless be entitled to a reduction of that sentence by one degree under
the Indeterminate <span style="">Sentence Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason given is that he was only fifteen
years and five months old at the time of the commission of the offense and so
could claim the benefits of Articles 68 and 80 of the Revised Penal Code as a
youthful offender.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The suggestion is not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The privileged mitigating circumstance of minority is not available in
prosecutions under the Dangerous Drugs Act, which is a special law.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Lagasca</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where the accused was 17 years, 6 months and 21 days when he committed the
crime, we declared as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Ordinarily, he would be entitled to the privileged
mitigating circumstance of minority under Article 68 of the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, because Presidential
Decree No. 1675, amending Republic Act No. 6425 imposes "life imprisonment
to death" <span style="">for </span>sale of
prohibited drugs, he is not entitled to an indeterminate sentence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can only recommend that executive clemency
be extended to him. </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And in People v. <span class="SpellE">Beralde</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
we also said of the accused who was also a minor at the time of the commission <span style="">of the offense:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> He is
entitled to the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority under Article 68
of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, he cannot be given an indeterminate sentence because
section 2 of the Indeterminate Sentence <span style="">Law
</span>provides that said law “shall not apply to persons convicted of offenses
punished with death penalty or life imprisonment.” Presidential Decree No. 1675
imposes "life imprisonment to death" on sale of prohibited drugs.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find therefore that the sentence pronounced on <span style="">each of the accused-appellants, including <span class="SpellE">Tokwaban</span>,
was correctly imposed.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subject only to the Bill of Rights, <span style="">all </span>efforts should be taken against the spread of drug
addiction, which has already taken a heavy toll on the lives and future <span style="">of </span>our people, especially the
youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The campaign must <span style="">continue with relentless resolve, that the
innocent and the weak may be spared from the misery of this malignant affliction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the appeal
is DISMISSED and the challenged decision AFFIRMED, with costs against the
accused-appellants.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
