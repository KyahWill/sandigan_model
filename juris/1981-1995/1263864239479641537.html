<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Herein petitioner, for
more than </span>twenty (20) years, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">has
</span>been the registered owner and in possession of a 41,545-square meter
parcel of land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">covered </span>by

private respondents subdivided their land among themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of the subdivision, private
respondents caused to be placed two (2) monuments inside the Southwest portion
of petitioner's land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner
filed with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>,
presided over by Judge Arturo B. Santos, an action to quiet title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same was docketed therein </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Civil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Case No. 4312.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, in their filed motion to dismiss with
counterclaim, alleged that they never encroached upon the landholding of
petitioner and nothing has been placed on his land which would create any cloud
thereon; and that the truth of the matter was that they merely subdivided their
own land according to their title and therefore there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">nothing for petitioner to </span>quiet or
remove cloud on his title.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the pre-trial of December 12, 1967, the parties agreed that
inasmuch as the only issue in dispute referred ultimately to the question of
the boundaries of their respective lots, the same might be resolved by
appointing a public surveyor of the Bureau of Lands to relocate the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">disputed area with the end in view of </span>determining
the true and correct boundaries of their parcels.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in line with the above-said agreement, in an
Order dated <st1:date year="1968" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1968</st1:date>,
ordered the Director of Lands to appoint an impartial public land surveyor to
conduct the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">relocation survey on the
disputed area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Jovino</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span>, Surveyor of the Bureau of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

substance, that petitioner's land is Lot A of the Subdivision plan, Psd-1413,
being a portion of the land described in Original Certificate of Title No. 126
in the name of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Golloy</span> (No. 11, Record on
Appeal, p. 23); that the land titled under OCT No. 126 was surveyed on March
18, 1918 and subsequently titled and registered on August 15, 1919 (No. 12,
Ibid); that on the other hand, </span>private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

on the boundaries of the two (2) lands (Nos. 226, 27, 28 and 29, Ibid.); and
that the <span class="SpellE">overlappings</span> are due to the defect in the
survey on petitioner's land since it did not duly conform with the previously
approved survey of Lot 1, 11-3218 </span>under OCT 8565 (No. 25, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ended
his report by submitting that private respondents' land, TCT No. 8565, prevails

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The instant petition is

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It must be stated that
private respondents and their predecessor </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in February, 1966, when the private respondents caused to be placed two (2)
monuments inside his land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be
recalled that, as per report of Surveyor <span class="SpellE">Jovino</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> (Record on Appeal, pp. 21-28), private </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">respondents’ land</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> (TCT-8565 is Lot No. 1, 11-8218) was

<span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, petitioner's land (TCT No.</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">45764) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>Lot-A
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Subdivision plan, Psd-14013, a
portion of land described in OCT No. 126) was surveyed on March 18, 1918 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and subsequently titled and registered in the
name of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Galloy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
said lands, having been surveyed and thereafter registered, it follows that </span>monuments
were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">placed therein </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">indicate their respective boundaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is hardly persuasive that private respondents’ predecessor, </span><span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Balanga</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">,
believing that she has </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a
rightful </span>claim to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the overlapped
portions, did not make any </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">move
to question the placement of the monuments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She could have easily objected to the placement and pointed out that the
placement of the monuments excluded the overlapped portions from her
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, no such objection was
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These facts could only be
construed to mean that private respondents' predecessor, <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balanga</span>, never believed that she has a right and
legal claim to the overlapped portion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There appears to be no evidence to support claims of repeated demands
against petitioner to refrain from cultivating the contested portion, much less
an action filed in court to enforce such demands.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Besides, considering that
petitioner and his predecessor </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">predecessors have been in
continuous possession in the concept of an owner, for almost fifty (50) years
(from August 15, 1919, when the property was registered, up to February, 1966,
when the private respondents caused the placement of two (2) monuments inside
his land), the latter if they have any right at all to the overlapped portion,
are guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Caragay-Layno</span> vs. Court
of Appeals (133 SCRA 718, 723-724 [1984]), this Court stated - <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">“Of significance is the
fact, as </span>disclosed by the evidence, that for twenty </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(20) </span>years from the date of
registration of title in 1947 up to 1967 when this suit for recovery of
possession was instituted, neither the deceased DE VERA up to the time of his
death in 1951, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nor his
successors-in-interest, had taken steps to possess or lay adverse claim to the </span>disputed
portion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They may, therefore be said to
he guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>Administrator </span>ESTRADA took interest </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in recovering the said portion </span>only

the title."<o:p></o:p></i></p>

the Torrens System is not conclusive as </span>to the holder's true ownership

alone become the owner of the land </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">illegally
included."<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In a more recent case, the case of Lola vs. Court of Appeals (145
SCRA 439, 449 [1986]), this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q"><i>"We also agree with the petitioners that <span class="SpellE">laches</span> effectively bars the respondent from recovering the
lot in dispute.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="2Q"><i>"Although the defense of prescription is unavailing to the
petitioners because, admittedly, the title to Lot No. 5517 </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is still registered in the name of
respondent, still the petitioners have acquired title to it by </span>virtue of
the equitable principle of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> due to respondent's
failure </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>assert her
claims and ownership for thirty two (32) years.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="2Q"><i>"There are precedents for this ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the following cases, we upheld the
equitable defense of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and ruled that the long
inaction and delay of the title holder in asserting his right over the disputed
lot bars him from recovering the same."<o:p></o:p></i></p>
