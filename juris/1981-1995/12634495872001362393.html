City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> G. Mackay, was the Resident Physician thereat.</p>

resignation of the incumbent, former <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City
Mayor Alejandro A. <span class="SpellE">Fider</span> designated and subsequently
appointed, as Assistant Hospital Administrator, private respondent Dr. Mackay,
a Resident Physician in said hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>, Jr., protested Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> designation and subsequent appointment alleging
among others that, as Chief of Clinics, he (<span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>)
was next-in-rank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The then Acting City Mayor <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> P. Robles, who succeeded former Mayor, now

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dissatisfied, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> elevated his case to the Civil Service Commission
on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On December 29, 1978, the
Civil Service Merit Systems Board issued Resolution No. 49 sustaining <span class="SpellE">Medalla's</span> appeal and revoking <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
appointment as Assistant Hospital Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the afore-stated
Resolution reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the records shows that appellant <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> is the Chief of Clinics of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City General Hospital; he is a holder of the Degree of Doctor of Medicine; he
has completed the requirements in Hospital Administration and is recommended
for the title of Certi­ficate in Hospital Administration; he is also a
candidate of a Masters degree in Hospital Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He possesses the First Grade eli­gibility (BA
1080) and had undergone relevant training in Hospital Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His performance rating is 'Very
Satisfactory'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Mackay
had been a Resident Physician, the position he held prior to his promotion to
the contested position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a holder
of the degree of Doctor of Medicine and is a First Grade eligible (BA 1080-Medical
Board).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is a graduate student in
Hospital Administration and as of September 18, 1978 he has com­pleted all
academic requirements for a certificate in Hospital Administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His performance rating is 'Very
Satisfactory'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A perusal of the organi­zational chart of the <span class="SpellE">Ospital</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
approved by the Hospital, Administrator would show that the Chief of Clinics is
the next lower position to the Assistant Hospital Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Resident Physician is not a next lower
position to the Assistant Hospital Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
and not Mackay is the person next in rank who may be promoted to the position
involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, even on the basis of competence and qualifications
to perform the duties of the position, the records show that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> is more competent and qualified than Dr.
Mackay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The qualification relied upon by
the Acting City Mayor in justifying the appointment of Dr. Mackay which is his
having completed the academic requirements for the Certificate in Hospital Administration
does not give Dr. Mackay the advantage inasmuch as Dr. <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
has also com­pleted all the academic requirements for a certificate in Hospital
Admi­nistration and is recommended for a title of Certificate in Hospital
Administration apart from being also a candidate for a Masters degree in

<p class="BODY">The Acting City Mayor, on behalf of Mackay, moved for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 7, 1979, totally disregarding the Decision of the Office
of the President, the same Acting City Mayor appointed Mackay, this time as
Hospital Admi­nistrator, and designated Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>
as his Assistant, thereby again completely by-passing <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mackay took his oath of office on May 7,
1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 27, 1979, however, the Civil Service Commission, acting on

the penal provision of P.D. No. 807, disapproved <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
appointment as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 20, 1979, Mackay moved for reconsideration asserting 1)
denial of due process of law inasmuch as the contested Resolution/Decisions
were issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>, and 2) that the Civil Service
Commission can not ignore nor overrule an appointment made by a City Executive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without awaiting the resolution of his Motion for
Reconsideration, Mackay filed, <span style="">on </span>July
23, 1979, before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, presided by respondent Judge, a
Petition for "<i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i> with
Preliminary Injunction and Damages" (Civil Case No. C-7770) against Hon. <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> Clave, the Civil Service Commission, the Acting City
Mayor, the City Treasurer, and <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>, praying that
said respondents be restrained from implementing the Decision of Hon. <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> Clave of April 24, 1979, the Resolution No. 49 of
the Merit Systems Board dated December 29, 1978, and the Decision of the Civil
Service Commission of June 27, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued the Restraining Order prayed for on July 25,
1979 enjoining implementation of the afore-stated Resolution/Decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1979, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> moved to
dissolve the Restraining Order and to dismiss the Petition al­leging mainly
that Mackay had not exhausted his ad­ministrative remedies and that the
latter's right to a Writ of Preliminary Injunction was not only dubious or
debatable but was clearly non-existent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hon. <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> Clave and the Civil Service
Commission likewise filed a Motion to Dismiss on the same ground of failure to
exhaust administrative remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 13, 1979, Mackay moved to suspend proceedings pending
final resolution by the Civil Service Commission of his Motion for the
reconsider­ation of the Decision of said Commission dated June 27, 1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 24, 1979, the Trial Court denied both Motions to
Dismiss filed by <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>, on the one hand, and Hon.
Clave and the Civil Service Commission, on the other, holding that <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> failure to await resolution of his Motions for
Reconsideration pending before the Office of the President and the Civil
Service Commission did not deprive him of a cause of action besides the fact
that according to the respective <span style="">Manifestations
</span>of the said Offices; the Motions for Reconsideration had already been
resolved adversely against Mackay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on <span class="SpellE">Medalla's</span> Motion for
Reconsideration thereof as well as his Motion to Lift Restraining Order, the
Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, in its Order of July 15, 1980, denied
reconsideration but lifted the Restraining Order "there being <span style="">no </span>showing that petitioner is entitled
to the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction." Respond­ent Judge
then set the case for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> instituted
this Petition before us praying that the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> be
restrained from proceeding with the hearing <span style="">and </span>that judgment be rendered as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">We issued a Restraining Order on August 27, <span style="">1980 </span>enjoining respondents from
proceeding with the case below.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 7, 1980, we required petitioner <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City as party-respondent, and the latter to comment on the Petition and to
state whether he is ready to issue an appointment to <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
as Hospital Administrator, <span class="SpellE">Medalla's</span> rights thereto
having been upheld by the <span style="">Civil Service
</span>Merit Systems Board and by the Office <span style="">of </span>the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Compliance, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> included an
additional prayer that the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> be
ordered to immediately appoint him as Hospital Administrator and to pay him
salary differentials.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment, the City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
in­voked the privilege of an appointing authority to determine who can best
fulfill the functions of an office citing the case of Aguilar vs. <span class="SpellE">Nieva</span>, <span style="">Jr.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to the matter of his readiness to <span style="">issue </span>an appointment to <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>, he manifested his preference to withhold action

Reconsideration of the Decision of June 27, 1979 of the Civil Service Merit
Systems <span style="">Board.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> submits that the
Trial 'Court erred in not dismissing <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
Petition before it, there being a clear showing of non-exhaustion of
administrative remedies, and that said Court was devoid of jurisdiction in
reviewing on <i>Certiorari</i> decisions of the Office of the President and of
the Civil Service Commission rendered in the exercise of their quasi-judicial
functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Mackay takes the contrary view and prays,
instead, that the contested Decisions/ Resolution be declared null and void and
respondent Judge ordered to proceed with the hearing of the case below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> Motions for
Reconsideration were, in fact, still pending resolution by Hon. <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span> C. Clave and the Civil Service Commission,
respective­ly, at the time private respondent Mackay filed the Petition below,
dismissal of said Petition can no longer be anchored on the ground of
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies, as <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
prays, consider­ing that Manifestations dated August 17 and 23, 1979 filed by
the said parties before the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> show that they had
resolved the incidents adversely against Mackay.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
That issue, therefore, has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">In so far as jurisdiction of the Court below to review by <i>Certiorari</i>
decisions and/or resolutions of the Civil Service Commission and of the
Presidential Executive Assistant is concerned, there should be no question but
that the power of judicial review should be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following rulings buttress this
conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>"The objection to a judicial review of a Presidential act
arises from a failure to recognize the most important principle in our system
of government, i.e., the separation of powers into three co-equal depart­ments,
the executive, the legislative and the judicial, each supreme within its own
assigned powers and duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a
presidential act is challenged before the courts of justice, it is not to be
implied <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that the Executive is being made
subject and subordinate to the courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The legality of his acts are under judicial review, not because the
Executive is inferior to the courts, but because the law is above the Chief
Executive him­self, and the courts seek only to interpret, apply or imple­ment
it (the law).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judicial review of the
President's decision on a case of an employee decided by the Civil Service
Board of Appeals should be viewed in this light and the bringing of the case to
the Courts should be governed by the same principles as govern the judicial
review of all administrative acts of all administrative officers."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>----o0o-----</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The courts may always examine into the exercise of power by a
ministerial officer to the extent of determining whether the particular power
has been granted to the officer, whether it is a legal power that could have
been granted to him, and whether it has been exercised in a legal manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This juris­diction does not depend upon an
act of the legislature authorizing it, but <u>inheres in the courts of general
jurisdiction as an essen­tial function of the judicial department</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(State Racing Commission v. Latonia <span class="SpellE">Agri</span>. <span class="SpellE">Asso</span>. 123 SW 681)."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For the speedy determination of the controversy, however, and
considering that the position involved is infused with public interest, rather
than remand the case to the Court below for further proceedings, we hold that
grave abuse of discretion on the part of Hon. <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span>
C. Clave and the Civil Service Merit Systems Board is absent.</p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, under the Revised Charter of the City of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> (RA No. 5502), it is clear that the power of
appointment by the City Mayor of heads of offices entirely paid out of city
funds is <u><span style="">subject to Civil Service
law, rules and regulations</span></u><span style=""> </span>(ibid.,
section 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City General Hospital is one of the city departments provided for <span style="">in </span>the said law (ibid., sec. 17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Hospital Administrator is appointed by
the City Mayor (ibid., section 66-B).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Hospital Administrator is the head of the City General Hospital empowered
to administer, direct, and coordinate all activities of the hospital to carry
out its objectives as to the care of the sick and the injured (ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under section 19(3) of the Civil Service Decree (PD No. 807,
effective on October 6, 1975), the recruitment or selection of employees for
promotions is drawn from the next-in-rank.</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recruitment
and Selection of Employees. -</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) When a vacancy <span style="">occurs </span>in a position in the second
level of the Career Service as defined in Section 7, the employees in the government
service who occupy the next lower positions in the occu­pational group under
which the vacant position is classified and in, other functionally related
occupational groups and who are competent, qualified and with the appropriate
civil service, eligi­bility shall be considered for promotion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 19(6) of the same Decree provides for the administrative
procedure by an aggrieved employee <span style="">in </span>case
of non-observance by the appointing authority of the next-in-rank rule, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 19(6) A qualified next­-in-rank employee shall have the
right to appeal initially to the department head and finally to the Office of
the President an appointment made x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (2) in favor of one who is
not next­-in-rank, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> if the employee making the appeal is not satisfied with
the written special reason or reasons given by the appointing authority for
such appointment: x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before deciding a con­tested appointment, the
Office of the President shall consult the Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this Section, 'qualified
next-in-rank' refers to an employee appointed on a permanent basis to a
position pre­viously determined to be next-in-rank to the vacancy proposed to
be filled and who meets the requisites for appointment thereto as previously
determined by the appointing authority and approved by the Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prescribed procedure has been followed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
appealed to the depart­ment head and from thence, in view of the latter's
unfavorable action, to the Civil Service Commission and thereafter to the
Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reso­lution No.
49 of the Civil Service Merit Systems Board, its Decision of June 27, 1979, and
the Decision of the Presidential Executive Assistant dated April 24, 1979, were
all rendered in <span class="SpellE">Medalla's</span> favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The special reason given by the Acting City
Mayor for <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> <span style="">appointment, </span>which is, that he had completed all academic
requirements for the Certificate of Hospital Administration, is not tenable,
since <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> himself was found to be in possession
of the same qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But while the
qualifications of both <span style="">petitioner </span><span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> and private respondent Mackay are at par, yet, it
is clear that the position of Chief of Clinics is the next lower position to
Hospital Administrator under the organizational line-up of the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, at the time of <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> ap­pointment as Assistant Hospital Administrator
and subsequently Hospital Administrator, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
outranked Mackay who was only a Resident Physician and, therefore, as the
next-in-rank, <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> is entitled to appointment as
Hospital Administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span> urging that he was
denied due process deserves scant consideration considering that subsequent
developments in the case establish that he was heard on his Motions for Reconsideration
by both the Civil Service Commission and the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, as respondent City Mayor alleges, a local
executive should be allowed the choice of men of his confidence; provided they
are qualified and eligible, who in his best estimation are possessed of the
requisite reputation, integrity, <span class="SpellE">knowledgeability</span>,
energy and judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
However, as reproduced heretofore, the Decision of the Civil Service Merit
Systems Board, upheld by the Office of the President, contains a judicious
assessment of the qualifications of both petitioner <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>
and private respondent Mackay for the contested position, revealing a care­ful
study of the controversy between the parties, which cannot be ignored.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The revocation of <span class="SpellE">Mackay's</span>
ap­pointment reveals no arbitrariness nor grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, 1) the appointment extended to private
respondent, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> C. Mackay, as Hospital
Administrator is hereby declared null and void; 2) respondent City Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City is hereby ordered to extend an appointment to
peti­tioner, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>,
as Hospital Administrator of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City
General Hospital immediately upon notice of this Decision; 3) peti­tioner, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span>, shall
receive all compensation and emoluments appertaining to said position
thenceforth, but without entitlement to salary differentials; and 4) respondent
