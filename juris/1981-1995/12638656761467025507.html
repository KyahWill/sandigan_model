of the Rules of Court, filed by the Philippine National Bank (PNB, for short)
questioning the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the <span style="">Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of
Appeals, in AC-G.R. No. Sp.-03784 entitled "Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Rebano</span>

senior bookkeeper of the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch since <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="4">6 April 1976</st1:date>, was charged by the PNB
Regional Investigating Committee on <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="4">3

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rebano's</span> culpability stemmed from the
discovery of check-kiting operations at the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
Branch sometime in 1978 and committed as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That Mr. <span class="SpellE">Monahar</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Hira</span> of Indian nationa­lity opened current account number
265-811280-8 with <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch on February 28,
1978; that the initial deposit to the account was a check for P500.00 drawn
against the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Commercial Banking Corporation
(RCBC); that after about four months from the opening of CA No. 265-811280-8,
it was uncovered that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Hira</span> perpetrated a kiting
operation involving the Branch and two other commercial banks, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Commercial Banking Corporation and (2) the <span style="">Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company; that withdrawals against
uncollected deposits allowed by <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch during
the entire period of the kiting operation amounted to P3,554,658.36 out of the
total check deposits of P3,863,500.00; that expected loss due to returned
checks amounts to P568,934.40 exclusive of interest and other incidental
charges."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="3">23 March 1981</st1:date>,
the PNB Board of Directors issued Board Resolution No. 506 dismissing private
respondent from the service with forfeiture of all benefits and with prejudice
to reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Merit
Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission, the PNB Board's decision was
affirmed, on the ground that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
negligence of respondent was made manifest when despite his being fully aware
of the Memorandum dated March 22, 1978, issued by <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span>
Bank Manager Antonio <span class="SpellE">Acyatan</span> that 'checks of
P1,000.00 and above which are drawn against uncollected deposits may only be
taken up in the books upon due approval by the branch cashier or any of the
branch officers,' he disregarded the same by posting ninety-two (92) check
withdrawals covering the period from April 4 to June 21, 1978 without approval
of any bank officers."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent filed a petition for review with the
Intermediate Appellate Court which, while affirming <span class="SpellE">Rebano's</span>
guilt and participation in the anomalous transactions <span class="SpellE">viola­tive</span>
of Central Bank and PNB rules against kiting, never­theless ordered <span class="SpellE">Rebano's</span> reinstatement and reduced the penalty from dismissal
to suspension without pay for six (6) months, with reimbursement of one half
(1/2) of back salaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate
court considered as a mitigating circumstance respondent's good faith in
believing that he was implicitly authorized to allow drawings against uncol­lected
deposits by his manager, Mr. Miranda (who was given <span style="">a </span>lighter penalty by PNB).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The appellate court, however, disregarded private
respondent's contention that the manager allowed kiting, holding that an
irregular practice cannot prevail over duly established and promulgated bank
rules.</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In denying <span class="SpellE">PNB's</span> motion for
reconsideration, the Court of Appeals decried the bank's failure to
sufficiently explain why there was great disparity between the penalty imposed
on respondent and the penalties imposed on other persons involved and
investigated in the kiting anomaly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, accordingly, insisted in applying leniency to <span class="SpellE">Rebano</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, PNB has availed of the present recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the beginning, private respondent had consistently claimed
that during his entire stay with the bank, he was not informed/briefed of any
clear or specific rule that posting on the ledger card of checks drawn against
uncollected deposits can be done only after such checks have been duly approved
for encashment by authorized bank officers pursuant to the guidelines set forth
in the Manual of Signing Authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
further contended that the PNB <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> Branch did not
suffer pecuniary loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
according to respondent, writing or stamping the word POSTED on the check was
not approval for encashment thereof, the responsibility for verifying whether
or not the posted check bears the approval of the authorized officer devolved
upon the paying teller.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question as to petitioner's guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of fact of the Civil Service
Commission and the Court of Appeals cannot be disturbed as they are based on
substantial evidence, but given the attendant circumstances, the issue boils
down to what is the correct and proper penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that private respondent's dismissal from the service
is proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on respondent's own
allegation, there is no indication that the culpability of the other implicated
officers and employees (Branch Manager, Assistant Manager or Cashier who have
approving authority over checks) was as grave as that of respondent whose act
of posting ninety two (92) checks drawn against uncollected deposits, without
authorization, facilitated their encashment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Resolution No. 84-093 of the Civil Service Commission clearly stated:</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">"It
should be noted that the check with­drawals of <span class="SpellE">Hira</span>
were made against uncollected deposits and therefore, under the Bank Rules,
prior approval of the proper officers is neces­sary before the respondent can
post it in the withdrawal entry of the ledger card and mark the checks
'posted'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, respondent's claim </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">that his postings were never technically approvals nor
authorizations allowing outright <span class="SpellE">encashments</span> of
checks drawn against uncollected deposits </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">untenable
considering that once </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">a </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">check is marked 'POSTED', it
means that the check is good, it is sufficiently funded and the signature of
the drawer is genuine, so that the 'POSTED' check can now be <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> or paid by the teller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This postulate renders false also
respondent's claim that his postings on the ledger card </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">(sic) not the operative act which constitutes approval
of check withdrawals against uncollected deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent was found by the PNB Board of Directors, the
Civil Service Commission and the Court of Appeals guilty of gross
misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Sec. 695 of the
Revised Administrative Code of 1917, a civil service subordinate officer or
employee may, for neglect of duty or violation of reasonable office regulations
xxx be removed from the service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Memorandum Circular No. 8, Series of 1970 of the Civil Service
Commission (Guidelines in the appli­cation of Penalties) prescribes the
following penalties for grave offenses:</p>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer</span> or demotion in rank or salary
from two to three grades or suspension for one year in its minimum period;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Forced resignation without prejudice to
reinstatement to forced resignation with prejudice to reinstatement in its
medium period;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dismissal in its maximum period."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considered as mitigating circumstances are:</p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Physical</span> illness</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals reduced the penalty from dismissal to
suspension for six (6) months without pay by reason of mitigating circumstances
- good faith and disparity between the penalties imposed on the respondent and
on other implicated offenders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it
may indeed be questionable that other persons were not as severely punished,
(unfortunately they are beyond the court's reach), petitioner's repeated
violations (92 times), standing alone, merit dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Policarpio</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span></span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">gross </span>misconduct in office by a

where a deputy sheriff found guilty of serious misconduct in office was<span style=""> likewise dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good faith cannot be appreciated in </span>favor
