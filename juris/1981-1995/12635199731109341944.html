<p class="BODY">That same day, <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1980</st1:date>, the COMELEC received an urgent letter-request from
private respondent asking that the canvassing of votes be annulled and the
proclamation of winning candidates be suspended for reasons of massive
terrorism and rampant irregularities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The letter alleged that armed goons supporting the petitioner disrupted
the counting of votes and caused the transfer of the ballot boxes and the
canvassing of votes to the Municipal Hall where accredited NP watchers were
denied access, and that ballots were tampered with and blank unused ballots
were filled up in favor of KBL candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The letter-request was docketed as P.P. Case No. 214, and petitioner was
ordered to submit an answer within ten (10) days from receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1980</st1:date>,
without any answer having been filed, COMELEC issued another Resolution
suspending the effects of the proclamation if one had been made, and directing
the Municipal Board of Canvassers of said Municipality and Mayor Cesar <span class="SpellE">Jardiel</span>, KBL candidate for Mayor, to submit their answer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 11, 1980, petitioner filed a plead­ing captioned
"Manifestation and Prayer by Way of Motion for Reconsideration"
assailing the Resolution of February 8, 1980 as <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of due process as it was issued without hearing, and before he could file the
required Answer, and that private respondent never brought any complaint to the
PC soldiers assigned by the Provincial Election Officer to the municipality nor
had complained about election irregularities to the Municipal Board of
Canvassers du­ring the canvass and proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioner filed his Answer denying private respondent's charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached were supporting affidavits,
including certifications of the Election Registrar of <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>
that no complaint of irregularities had been received (Annexes "D"
and "D-1", Petition) as well as of two PC sol­diers assigned thereat
that there was no terrorism by policemen and armed goons during the election in
said municipality (Annex "E", Petition).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a reply disputing the veracity of petitioner's certifications,
and attached counter-affidavits in support of his allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also on March 4, 1980, COMELEC issued a Resolution allowing
petitioner and private respondent to file "simultaneous
manifestations" in respect of the affidavits, to be marked as their exhibits,"
so as to inform them of the affiants to be brought to Manila and cross-examined
during the hearing of the case" on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, a rejoinder by petitioner and a
<span class="SpellE">surrejoinder</span> by private respondent were also filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearings, private respondent presented four witnesses,
who identified and affirmed the contents of their affidavits, and were
cross-examined by petitioner's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1980</st1:date>,
COMELEC required private respondent to make a written offer of evidence and allowed
petitioner to file written objections thereto and a "motion to dismiss if
he so desires" and that "upon the filing of the motion to dismiss and
objection thereto, the said incident shall be deemed submitted for
resolution".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondent submitted a written offer of evidence, to which petitioner
interposed his objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Motion to Dismiss for insufficiency of evidence to support
allegations of massive terrorism and rampant irregularities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent filed an opposition to
said motion, and on <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioner was given time to file a reply after which the incident was to be
deemed submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 22, 1980, the Ministry of Justice Election Task Force, deputized
by the COMELEC in Resolution No. 1449-A, dated February 14, 1980, to
investigate and prosecute persons found violating election offenses committed
in relation to the conduct of the January 30, 1980 elections, and before whom a
complaint had likewise been filed by private respondent, dismissed said
complaint for insufficiency of evidence (Annex "G", Petition).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1980</st1:date>,
COMELEC issued the questioned Resolution wherein it <span class="SpellE">priorly</span>
observed:</p>

<blockquote>"A painstaking examination - demanded by the gravity of the
issues raised - of the records in this case resulted in the inescapable finding
that <u>serious</u> and <u>widespread</u> election venalities <u>did</u> occur
in the hapless community of <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner (now private respondent) submitted
as his evidence documents tending to establish said fact, but the one single
piece of evidence that sticks out prominently because it commends itself with
authority and credibility is the official telegraphed report to then Chairman
Perez from <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Special Action Team<b> </b>for
Region 9, 'COMSAT 9' for short, dated January 31, 1980, and marked as
petitioner's Exhibit 'G' (Annex 'E' to the petitioner's Answer and Opposition
to the Motion for Reconsideration).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Created by Commission Resolution No. 1430, which was pro­mulgated on <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1980</st1:date>, COMSAT 9 was composed
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span>,
Provincial Election Officer of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>; Lt. Col. Francisco V. <span class="SpellE">Samala</span>
of JAGO; and Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>, Assistant Chief,
Investigation and Prosecution Division, Law Department, this Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, it functioned and acted as
'the deputy and implementing arm of the <span class="SpellE">Commision</span>'
(Sec. 1, Resolution No. 1430) to be sent on orders of the Chairman of the
Commission to areas where the holding of free, orderly and honest elections is
placed in jeopardy due to terrorism, violence, frauds, vote-buying and other
analogous causes.' (Sec. 3, Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
assignment:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Region 9, which included the
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
of which <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>, the present case milieu, is one
of the municipalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of
its assigned tasks, it came up with its above-mentioned <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1980</st1:date> report to this Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC then concluded:</p>

Unhesitatingly, We declare the elections or the results thereof, should be
annulled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considered in the light of the
pervasive and wanton disregard of Our election laws and processes, the election
results in said town do not reflect the true or popular will of the electorate
there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They justify no less than the
extreme sanction of their being nullified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Body is ever-conscious of the fundamental injunction that the
power to annul the elections should be exercised with extreme caution (<span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> vs. Lopez, 50 Phil. 45) in order not to cause
unnecessary disenfranchisement, and in the <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span> experience,
We did no less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">regretably</span>,
the compelling circumstances dictated the nullification."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner was denied by
the COMELEC in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="10">October
 27, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before us, petitioner prays for the reversal of the COMELEC
Resolutions, dated December 10, 1980 and October 27, 1981, contending that:</p>

<blockquote>"1. <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> resolution on the merits of PP Case No. 214,
without first receiving his evidence, constitutes a denial of due process which
renders said resolution null and void.</blockquote>

the findings of a Ministry of Justice 'Task Force' which was deputized by
COMELEC to investigate and prosecute violations of the election laws during the
January 30, 1980 elections, to the effect that there was insufficient evidence
to prove charges of terrorism and irregularities during said election in <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.</blockquote>

special elections in <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">1. The alleged
denial of due process to petitioner on the ground that the COMELEC rendered its
decision without first resolving petitioner's pending Motion to Dismiss and
without giving him the opportunity to present his evidence, is not well
taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the COMELEC had explained in
resolving petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of its Decision.</p>

<blockquote>"Our failure to resolve first said Motion to Dismiss was
criticized by the respondent and viewed by him as a denial of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With substantial evidence from both parties on hand, upon which a decision
on its merits could be reached without sacrificing the fundamental precept of
due process, both in its substantial and its procedural aspects, this Body
elected to dispose of this case on the merits, rather than go to the circuitous
process of resolving independently the letter-motion to dismiss of the
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss was,
therefore, included in the disposition of the entire case, as it was mandated
by the circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Resort to this
procedural short-cut was compelled by the circumstance that being a
pre-proclamation case, it had to be threshed out summarily, keeping in mind the
length of time that had lapsed after the date of the 1980 local elections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner had <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by means of sworn statements the allegations of private respondent of massive terrorism
and rampant irregularities in the counting of votes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The COMELEC had weighed the conflicting pleadings,
certifications and affidavits before it and concluded that the case was ripe
for resolution on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found
that "a painstaking examination -- demanded by the gravity of the issues
raised -- of the records in this case resulted in the inescapable finding that
serious and widespread election venalities did occur in the hapless community
of <span class="SpellE">Penaranda</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedural step taken by COMELEC finds support in the case of
<span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> vs. Lopez, 50 Phil. 45 (1927), the pertinent
portion of which is quoted herein below:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In an election protest proceeding, however, which is a
summary one, and in which the periods are short and fatal, and trials rapid and
preferential as the peremptory nature of the litigation so requires, the motion
for dismissal at that stage of the proceeding must be considered as a demurrer
to the evidence presented by the protestant, with implied waiver by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> to present his evidence, whatever may be the
ruling, whether adverse or favorable, either in the first instance or on
appeal, the court of origin or appellate court having the power to definitely
decide the protest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, in the prosecution
of election protests the ordinary practice were to be followed in regard to the
presentation of motions for dismissal or of demurrers to the evidence, in the
majority of cases, if not always, the law would be frustrated and the will of
the electorate defeated, to the great detriment of the underlying principles of
representative government, because, in case of revocation of a ruling
sustaining the motion of dismissal or the demurrer on appeal, the case would
have to be remanded to the court below for the continuation of the trial and
the introduction of evidence by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, thus
causing the proceeding to continue during the term of the office in question,
with possible result that the defeated, and not the elected, candidate would be
discharging the office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In election protests, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>
should not be permitted to present a motion for dismissal or a demurrer to the
evidence of the protestant, unless he waives the introduction of his own
evidence in case the ruling on his motion or demurrer is adverse to him, in
which case the court that tries the case must definitely decide it."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends that
the challenged COMELEC Resolution relied solely on the telegram sent by the
COMELEC Special Action Team for Region 9 (supra) and that said telegram
"just found its way" in the record of PP Case No. 214 "without
its sender or author identified and made available on the witness stand for
searching confrontation and cross-examination".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contention is not borne out by the
records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The telegram was actually a
report to the COMELEC addressed to its Chairman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was official in character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was marked as Exhibit "G" and
was formally offered in evidence together with other exhibits by private respondent,
to which petitioner filed his objections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The members of COMSAT Team No. 9, namely, Lt. Col. Francisco V. <span class="SpellE">Samala</span> of the Office of the Judge Advocate General, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lapitan</span>, Provincial
Election Officer of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
and Atty. Jose <span class="SpellE">Balbuena</span>, Asst. Chief, Investigation
and Prosecution Division, Law Department, both of the COMELEC, were in the list
of witnesses submitted to COMELEC by private respondent in compliance with its
Order, from which petitioner could select whom to cross examine (Annex
"2", Comment of private respondent).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, in his request for cross-examination, petitioner chose not to
include them in his list of witnesses whom he desired to cross-examine (Annexes
"2" &amp; "3", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The report of COMSAT No. 9 is deserving of serious consideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The report is not hearsay because COMSAT 9 was the COMELEC Special Action

(Emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">COMSAT 9, therefore, maybe said to have
been an extension of the COMELEC itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the telegram to which the COMELEC gave “full faith
and credit" considering that "COMSAT 9 was Our special 'deputy' and
'implementing arm' in the critical area or areas which were expected to become
trouble spots in the last elections"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>,
the COMELEC also relied on other pleadings and docu­ments of record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it stated:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The record will disclose petitioner's lack of candor and
honesty on his assertion, because from its mute pages, the follow­ing facts are
undisputedly set out:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that from February 11, 1980, when he filed
his Manifestation and Prayer by way of Motion for Reconsideration, to May 9,
1980, when he filed his Supplemental Rejoinder, petitioner had filed with this
Commission five (5) substantial pleadings dealing with his defense;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that in all said five pleadings, he had
argued extensively his defense and the deme­rits of his adversary's cause;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that prior to <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1980</st1:date>, the date of the challenged resolution,
a total of 32 documents, most of them affidavits, were submitted to this
Commission as evidence and annexed to the aforesaid pleadings.</p>

<blockquote>To emphasize the obvious, the foregoing were taken into ac­count,
together with the petitioner's exhibits, in the assessment of the evidence and
in arriving at the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="NUM">3. Petitioner's contention that the findings of the Ministry of
Justice Election Task Force (Annex "G", Petition) dismissing the
complaint against petitioner for insufficiency of evidence is <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> is
untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Task Force was deputized
by the COMELEC to the end that violators throughout the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of laws relative to elections would be charged in Court and correspondingly
penalized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charges filed before it
were for election offenses which are criminal in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not a body exercising judicial
functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the COMELEC belongs the
prerogative to enforce all laws relative to the conduct of elections and to see
to it that elections are free, honest and orderly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be "<span class="SpellE">estopped</span>"
by any finding or recommendation by any Task Force organized to assist it in
the performance of its functions.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Neither is there merit in petitioner's contention that since he
has already been proclaimed, the present complaint is no longer viable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case filed by private respondent is not
in reality a pre-proclamation case but one for annulment of election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's having been proclaimed, his
having taken his oath of office, and his having assumed the duties thereof,
present no impediment to the prosecution of this case to its conclusion.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. The power of the COMELEC to order the holding of a special
election was upheld in Sanchez vs. COMELEC, 114 SCRA, 454 (1982) wherein
"we (upheld) the power and prerogative of the COMELEC to annul an election
where the will of the voters has been defeated, as well as to call for a
special election where widespread terrorism, whether before or after election,
has been proven resulting in a failure to elect, without need of recourse to
the President and the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
for the enactment of remedial legislation".</p>
