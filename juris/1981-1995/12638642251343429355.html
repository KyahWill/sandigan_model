				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The property subject of this case is claimed by both the
petitioners and the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under two separate deeds of sale executed by the same vendor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Republic was sustained by the trial court
and the Court of Appeals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioners are now before us, contending that the courts below have erred
and so should be reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Disputed are some 5,900 square meters of land forming part of a
lot<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
situated in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and covered by Original
Certificate of Title No. 16545 in the name of Alejandro Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was inherited by <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>
Trinidad, their sole heir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
transferred it by virtue of an <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span> dated May 3, 1928, to Pedro <span class="SpellE">Bergado</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justina</span> <span class="SpellE">Galinato</span>, the petitioners' parents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
She then conveyed it again, this time through a Deed of Sale dated <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1947</st1:date>, to the
Parent-Teacher Association of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Community</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners claim the property by right of inheritance from
their parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Republic says the
land was donated to it on <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="7">July 26,
 1977</st1:date>, by the said PTA.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rejecting their appeal, the respondent court held that the
petitioners had slept on whatever right they might have had and were now barred
by prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> from asserting it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, their alleged right, such as it
was, was inferior to the title asserted by the Republic to the property in
question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that the Republic was itself barred from
putting up the defenses of prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
because these had not been pleaded earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These issues were not raised in the answer and neither were they
asserted at the pre-trial conference.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The consequence is that these objections can no longer be allowed at
this late hour.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that:</p>

<blockquote>One of the objectives of pre-trial procedure is to take the trial
of cases out of the realm of surprise and maneuvering.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pre-trial is primarily intended to make
certain that all issues necessary to the disposition of a case are properly
raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, to obviate the element of
surprise, parties are expected to disclose at a pre-trial conference all issues
of law and fact which they intend to raise at the trial, except such as may
involve privilege or impeaching matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The determination of issues at a pre-trial conference bars the
consideration of other questions on appeal.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, this is a statement only of the general rule on the
procedure to be observed in pre-trials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is subject to the specific exception emphasized in the later case of <span class="SpellE">Gicano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gegato</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where Mr. Justice Andres R. <span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span> declared:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We have
ruled that trial courts have authority and discretion to dismiss an action on
the ground of prescription when the parties’ pleadings or other facts on record
show it to be indeed time-barred; and it may do so on the basis of a motion to
dismiss, or an answer which sets up such ground as an affirmative defense; or
even if the ground is alleged after judgment on the merits, as in a motion for
reconsideration; or even if the defense has not been asserted at all, as where
no statement thereof is found in the pleadings, or where a defendant had been
declared in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is essential
only, to repeat, is that the facts demonstrating the lapse of the prescriptive
period, be otherwise sufficiently and satisfactorily apparent on the record;
either in the averments of the plaintiff's complaint, or otherwise established
by the evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was thus not improper for the respondent court to consider the
issue of prescription in determining the respective claims of the contending
parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that the disputed property had been in the
possession of the PTA since it acquired the same by virtue of the deed of sale
dated <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1947</st1:date>,
and of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
since <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1977</st1:date>, date
of the deed of donation executed in its favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The PTA and later the Republic had been constructing improvements on the
land which certainly could not have escaped the attention of the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During all that time, the land was also
enclosed with a barbed wire fence and later with an adobe wall erected by the
school administration sometime "before 1965-1966."</p>

<p class="BODY">The fence and later the wall symbolized the PTA's exclusive claim
of ownership to the disputed property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The construction of various infrastructures on the land - consisting of
the right wing of the main building, the administration building, the annex
thereof, the reading center, and the water reservoir, among other valuable
improvements - was also an unmistakable act of ownership which the petitioners
could not ignore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not one of them
protested.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the petitioners maintained their tolerant silence for
thirty-four years, breaking it only in 1981, when they filed their complaint to
nullify the private respondent's title to the disputed land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Significantly, one of their brothers, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Bergado</span>,
was the treasurer of the PTA who released the funds for most of the
aforementioned constructions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An action for recovery of title to or possession of real property
or an interest therein can be brought only within ten years from the date the
cause of action accrues.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, the cause of action accrued as early as 1947 when the
property was sold to the PTA or at the very latest in 1965-1966 when the adobe
wall enclosing the property was erected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Counted from either year, the ten-year prescriptive period has
indisputably elapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners'
complaint was clearly barred already when it was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="10">October 21, <span class="GramE">1981</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> almost three and a half decades after the PTA had taken
possession of the land.</p>

<blockquote>An action for recovery of the <span class="GramE">title,</span> or
possession of, real property or an interest therein, can only be brought within
ten (10) years after the cause of action accrues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prescription is rightly regarded as a statute
of repose whose object is to suppress fraudulent and stale claims from
springing up at great distances of time and surprising the parties or their
representatives when the facts have become obscure from the lapse of time or
death or removal of witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Independently of prescription, another obstacle has operated
against the petitioners, to wit, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This impediment was explained by the Court in
the landmark case of <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> in a general sense is failure or
neglect, for an unreasonable and <span class="SpellE">unxplained</span> length of
time, to do that which, by exercising due diligence, could or should have been
done earlier; it is negligence or omission to assert a right within a
reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it
either has abandoned it or declined to assert it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> or of "stale
demands" is based upon grounds of public policy which requires, for the
peace of society, the discouragement of stale claims and, unlike the statute of
limitations, is not a mere question of time but is principally a question of
the inequity or unfairness of permitting a right or claim to be enforced or
asserted.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that neither prescription nor <span class="SpellE">laches</span> can operate against them because their title to the
property is registered under the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> system and
therefore <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, they contend that in cases of
double sale, assuming the sale to the private respondent was also valid, the
buyer who registers the property first shall be preferred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principles cited, while admittedly correct, are nonetheless
not applicable to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
reason is that what the petitioners registered was not their ownership of the
property but the <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span>, and at that only in 1964, thirty-six
years after it was executed by <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>
Trinidad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most she conveyed to the
petitioners' parents was inchoate ownership as she herself was not the
registered owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property remained
in the names of <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>'s parents; no transfer
certificate of title had been issued in her favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, no certificate could also be
issued in the petitioners' names.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the petitioners did not take possession of the land as they
could have on the strength of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, they permitted the PTA and later the Republic to do so and made
no protest at all until 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that as the sole heir of her parents, <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> Trinidad lawfully inherited the lot in question
upon their deaths, conformably to Article 777 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the affidavit of adjudication she
executed on <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1947</st1:date>,
was only a formal affirmation of her ownership by right of succession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even so, it was still necessary for the
purpose of registering the property in the name of her vendees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that without such affidavit
of adjudication, a transfer certificate of title could not have been issued in
favor of the petitioners, or of their parents before them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the transferor-vendor named therein
was <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span> Trinidad, the registered owners of the
land were still Alejandro Trinidad and <span class="SpellE">Aniceta</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> per the original certificate of title.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span> cannot itself be considered the
affidavit of adjudication for the fact is that it did not comply with the
requirements of Rule 74, Section 1, particularly the notice by
publication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This compliance cannot be
presumed because the instrument was basically a deed of sale and such documents
are not required to be published.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
contrast, such a presumption may apply to the affidavit of adjudication of <st1:date year="1947" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1947</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show that any evidence
has been adduced by the petitioners to negate the regularity of that
instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the failure of the petitioners to execute the
affidavit of adjudication is not really decisive of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the view of the Court, the most telling
consideration is that the petitioners' parents did not immediately take
possession of the property upon the execution by <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>
Trinidad of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span> in 1928.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And neither did the petitioners themselves when their parents died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners' claim is that they were
ousted from the land only in 1979, but this is belied by the buildings and
other constructions already erected thereon at the time by the PTA and the
government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the petitioners
have not shown that they had paid the corresponding realty taxes on the land
during any of the years they were supposedly occupying the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, it has been established that the PTA did
immediately enter the property when the deed of sale was concluded in
1947.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the land had long been in
the hands of the government when it finally occurred to the petitioners to
register the <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span> on <st1:date year="1964" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apart from the circumstance earlier stressed that the registration was
thirty-six years late, it was obviously made in bad faith because the
petitioners were at that time already aware that the respondent Republic of the
Philippines was in possession of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly applicable is Article 1544 of the Civil Code providing as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>If the same thing should have been sold to different vendees, the ownership
shall be transferred to the person who may have first taken possession thereof
in good faith, if it should be movable property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to the
person acquiring it who <u>in good faith</u> first recorded it in the Registry
of Property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain <u>to
the person who in good faith was first in the possession</u>; and, in the
absence thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is
good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Interpreting this provision in <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>
v. Del Rosario,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>It is true that when real property is the subject matter of a
double sale, the purchaser who first registers it in the registry becomes the
owner thereof under the provision of Article 1473 of the Civil Code, but this
legal provision should not be understood in an absolute sense, nor does it
constitute a ground to sustain the demurrer, because the rights conferred by
said article upon one of the two purchasers of the same real property who has
registered his title in the registry of deeds, do not come into being if the
registration is not made in good faith.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The inscription of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Escritura</u></span>
<u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Compraventa</u></span> in 1964 produced no
legal effect because it was made in bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ownership should therefore vest in the respondent Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
because it was first in possession of the property in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">If any recourse is still available to the petitioners, it
definitely is not against the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their claim for satisfaction - on which we do
not rule at this time - may be addressed only to <span class="SpellE">Marciana</span>
Trinidad who, for reasons still to be discovered, sold the same land once, and
then once again, to separate purchasers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
