				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether or not an elective
official may be entitled, in the event that he <span class="GramE">be</span>
separated from the service, to the commutation of his vacation and sick leave.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Apolonio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Maleniza</span>, was twice elected Provincial Governor of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and he served his
term of office from 1960-1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He,
however, lost in his reelection bid in the 1967 elections.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972, he filed an application for the commutation of his
alleged accumulated vacation and sick leave effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1968</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1968</st1:date>, or for a total of 160 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Commission on Audit denied the application ruling
in part, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>As maybe seen in the aforementioned GAO Provincial Circular No. 24,
the Secretary of Justice has already opined that only <u>appointive</u>
officials and employees of the government fall within the intendment of the
provisions of Section 286 of the Revised Administrative Code; that it was not
the legislative intent, in enacting Sections 284 and 285 of the same Code, to <span class="GramE">extend</span> leave privilege to non-appointive employees; and that
the Manuel case, supra, may not be cited as binding and applicable precedent in
the adjudication of claims of <u>any</u> and <u>all</u> <u>elective</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>officials</u> for the commutation of
vacation and sick leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">may </span>be mentioned, in this connection,
that the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> opinion of the Secretary of
Justice has invariably been adopted by this Commission and cited as basis for
its decisions on similar claims filed by elective officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears <b>noting</b> that subsequent
actions taken by the Civil Service Commission and the Supreme Court in similar
cases tend to sustain and uphold such decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">in
</span>the case of former Congressman Lucas <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>,
the Acting Commissioner of Civil Service signified his acquiescence to the
stand taken by this Commission that in the absence of a provision of law
explicitly granting leave privileges to the members of Congress, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>’ claim for commutation of his alleged vacation and
sick leave credits may not be favorably acted upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in the cases of former Councilor Esteban
Rosales of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Naga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and former Vice Mayor Mateo V.
<span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
their respective petitions for review of the decision of this Commission
disallowing their similar claims were denied by<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
Supreme Court for lack of merit in its Resolutions dated <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1974</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1974</st1:date>, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Esteban Rosales vs.
Commission on Audit, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-37777 Mateo v. <span class="SpellE">Tupaz</span> vs. Commission on Audit G.R. No. 37959).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, therefore, the Supreme Court
struck down as worthless the proposition that elective officials are embraced
within the coverage of the Leave Law (Sec. 284, et seq., Revised Adm. Code) and
that the Manuel decision favorably applies to their claim for commutation of
their alleged leave.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon all the foregoing premises, it is
regretted that your aforesaid claim has to be, as it is hereby, denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 40-41)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the aforesaid ruling, petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same was denied by
respondent Commission ruling that -</p>

<blockquote>With respect to the Manuel case, supra,
it is, as it has been, the considered view of this Commission that the said
case may not, <u>for</u> <u>audit</u> <u>purposes</u>, be used as the sole
basis of claims for commutation of leave by elective officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By itself alone, the case is inadequate to
support claims of this nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For,
apart and aside from it, there are other audit requirements that <span class="GramE">must needs</span> be met by the claimant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a stand finds support in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> opinion of the Secretary of Justice to the
effect that the Manuel case may not be cited as binding and applicable
precedent in the adjudication of claims of any and all elective officials for
the commutation of vacation and sick leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, an elective official claiming leave commutation cannot
rely solely on the Manuel case; he must first show indubitably under what
provision of law he has earned and accumulated leave before he can be entitled
to the commutation thereof, whereupon he need not even invoke the Manuel
decision for his right to such commutation would become a matter of law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the decision of the Commission on Audit
is not in accord with the decision of this Court in the case of Benito C.
Manuel vs. Gen. Auditing Office (L-28952, Dec. 29, 1971, 42 SCRA 660).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the same must be dismissed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, the granting and enjoyment of leave of
absence of government officers and employees are governed by Chapter 13,
entitled Leave Law, of the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically mentioned therein as entitled to
leave privileges are justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals,
judges, teachers and, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>general,
employees of the national, provincial, city and municipal governments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Leave is based on attendance in accordance
with the forty hours-a-week law to give respite when needed and without loss of
pay to officers and employees whose hours of work are fixed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, part-time officers and employees are
not entitled to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 15, Rule
XVI, Revised Civil Service Rules)</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that justices, judges and teachers are
appointive officers and employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
are reasons to believe, however, that the other employees referred to in the
Leave Law are likewise <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">appointive</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>employees of the national and local
governments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, Section 286 of the
Revised Administrative Code, as amended, which provides when vacation and sick
leave may be taken, speaks, in its second proviso, of the <u>commutation</u> of
the salary during the vacation and sick leave of <u>any</u> <u>appointed</u> <u>officer</u>
<u>or</u> <u>employee</u>, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mention
may be made, in this connection, of the fact that prior to the amendment of
this section by Republic Act No. 611, the underlined phrase was worded as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"any <u>permanently</u>
appointed officer or employee," thus strongly indicating the legislative
intent that whether before or after such amendment, only appointive officers of
employees are covered by the provisions of said section.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, under Section 284 of the same Code,
employees may be granted leave privileges only after six months’ continuous,
faithful and satisfactory service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
six-month period obviously pertains to the probationary period of six months
referred to in the Civil Service Law which appointive employees must serve
following their appointment in order that they may acquire permanent status
[Sec. 24(b) RA 2260, as amended], <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>requirement
which does not apply to elective officials who serve for a fixed term
commencing upon their assumption of office without regard to their status.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Manuel case resolved affirmatively the issue of whether or
not an elective official, is this case, a Municipal <u>Mayor</u>, may be
entitled, in the event of voluntary retirement or separation from the service
thru no fault of his own, to the commutation of vacation and sick leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was anchored on the following
statutory provisions:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) Section 286 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by
Republic Act 1081, which provides that "vacation and sick leave shall be
cumulative and any part thereof which may not be taken within the calendar year
in which earned may be carried over the succeeding year but whenever any
officer, employee or laborer of the Government of the Philippines shall
voluntarily resign or be separated from the service thru no fault of his own he
shall be entitled to the commutation of all accumulated vacation and sick leave
to his credit; Provided that the total vacation leave and sick leave that can <span class="SpellE">accummulate</span> to the credit of any officer of employee shall,
in no case, exceed 10 months x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>";
and</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) Section 12(c) of Commonwealth Act 186 as inserted by Republic
Act 1616 and amended by Republic Act 4968, which allows the retirement of any
official or employee, appointive or elective, regardless of age and employment
status, who has rendered a total of at least twenty (20) years, and the <span class="SpellE">cumulation</span> of his unused vacation and sick leave based on
the highest rate received which he may have to his credit at the time of his
retirement under the cited act.</p>

<p class="BODY">But a reading of Section 286 will reveal that the provision is
intended only to cover appointive officers, employees, teachers or laborers of
the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 12(c) of
Commonwealth Act 186, as inserted by Republic Act 1616 was amended by Republic
Act 4968 on <st1:date year="1967" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only on this date that retirement
benefits were extended to elective officials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the extension of retirement benefits in favor of elective
officials does not automatically entitle the latter to the commutation of "unused
vacation and sick leave" since such privilege would depend on the
existence of a law expressly granting elective officials leave privileges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from the last sentence of
Section 12 (c) of Commonwealth Act 186, as amended, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Officials and employees under this Act shall be entitled to
the <u>Commutation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>unused</u> <u>vacation</u> <u>and</u>
<u>sick</u> <u>leave</u>, based on the highest rate received, <u>which</u> <u>they</u>
<u>may</u> <u>have</u> <u>to</u> <u>their</u> <u>credit</u> <u>at</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <u>time</u> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>retirement</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In other words, before a retiring
official or employee may be entitled to commutation of his vacation and sick
leave which he may have to his credit at the time of his retirement, he must
first show entitlement to such leave credit because in the absence of such
entitlement, he enjoys no such right of commutation for there is nothing to
commute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There must be a law authorizing
such privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But there is no such
statutory authority insofar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>elective
officials are concerned except Sec. 2187 wh<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">i</span>ch authorizes sick leave of <u>mayors</u> only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner in the case at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">bar, </span>who was a provincial governor is
not covered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it were the intention of the law to
authorize accumulation of leave to provincial governors, it could have so
easily provided under the chapter governing provincial governors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The absence of any such authority gives rise
to only one conclusion and that is, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">all
</span>elective officials, with the exception of municipal mayors, are not
entitled to commutation of leave privileges since there is no law authorizing
said elective officials to earn and accumulate leave credits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Manuel case, therefore, does not apply in
this case, because Manuel was a Municipal Mayor.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another consideration which argues against the inclusion of elective
officers among those entitled to leave benefit is that they belong to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">so-</span>called "exempt
service".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, they are
not required or bound to observe the prescribed government office hours as in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the</span> case of appointive officers who
are so required under the Civil Service Rules which were promulgated by the
Commissioner of Civil Service to implement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the Civil </span>Service Law in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">exercise </span>of his rule-making power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 16, <u>ibid</u>; Rule XV, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Civil S</span>ervice Rules).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a general proposition, their
entitlement to salary is not dependent upon actual attendance in office.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span> In fact, they are not even required to keep a
record of their daily attendance such as by accomplishing Form No. 48 (Daily
Time Record) or punching the <span class="SpellE">bundy</span> clock.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, whether or not absent from office, their
right to receive salary is not adversely affected.</p>
