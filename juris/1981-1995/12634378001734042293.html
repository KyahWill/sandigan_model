				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In assaying the requisite norms for qualifications and eminence of
<span style="">a </span>magistrate,
legal authorities place a premium on how he has complied with his continuing
duty to know the law.  A quality thus
considered essential to the judicial character <span style="">is </span>that of “a man of learning who
spends tirelessly the weary hours after midnight acquainting himself with the
great body of traditions and the learning of the law; is profoundly learned in
all the learning of the law; and knows how to use that learning.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, it is the primary duty of a judge, which he owes to
the public and to the legal profession, to know the very law he is supposed to
apply to a given controversy.  He <span style="">is </span>called
upon to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with the statutes and
procedural rules.  Party litigants will
have great faith in the administration of justice if judges cannot justly be
accused of apparent deficiency in their grasp of the legal principles.  For, service in the judiciary means a
continuous study and research on the <span style="">law </span>from beginning to end.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

August 19, 1992, respondent Judge Manuel T. Muro of the Regional Trial Court
(RTC) of Manila, Branch 54, was charged by State Prosecutors Nilo C. Mariano,
George C. Dee and Paterno V. Tac-an with ignorance of the law, grave misconduct
and violations of Rules 2.01, 3.01 and 3.02 of the Code of Judicial Conduct,
committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That on August 13, 1992, respondent judge issued an Order
dismissing eleven (11) cases (docketed as Crim. Cases Nos. 92-101959 to 92­-101969,
inclusive) filed by the undersigned complainant prosecutors (members of the DOJ
Panel of Prosecutors) against the accused Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos, for
Violation of Central Bank Foreign Exchange Restrictions, as consolidated in CB
Circular No. 960, in relation to the penal provisions of Sec. 34 of R.A. 265,
as amended, x x x;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That respondent Judge issued his Order solely on the basis of
newspaper reports (August 11, 1992 issues of the Philippine Daily Inquirer and
the Daily Globe) concerning the announcement on August 10, 1992 by the President
of the Philippines of the lifting by the government of all foreign exchange
restrictions and the arrival at such decision by the Monetary Board as per
statement of Central Bank Governor Jose Cuisia;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->3.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That claiming that the reported announce­ment of the Executive
Department on the lifting of foreign exchange restrictions by two newspapers
which are reputable and of national circulation had the effect of repealing
Central Bank Circular No. 960, as allegedly supported by Supreme Court
decisions <span style="">x x </span>x, the Court
contended that it <span style="">was </span>deprived
of jurisdiction, and, therefore, motu prop(r)io had to dismiss all the eleven
cases aforementioned “for not to do so opens this Court to charges of trying
cases over which it has no more jurisdiction;”</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->4.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That in dismissing aforecited cases on August 13, 1992 on the
basis of a Central Bank Circular or Monetary Board Resolution which as of date
hereof, has not even been officially issued, and basing his Order/decision on a
mere newspaper account of the advance announcement made by the President of the
said fact of lifting or liberalizing foreign exchange controls, respondent
judge acted prematurely and in indecent haste, <span style="">as </span>he had no way of determining the full intent of the new CB
Circular or Monetary Board resolution, and whether the same provided for
exception, as in the case of persons who had pending criminal cases before the
courts for violations of Central Bank Circulars and/or regulations previously
issued on the matter;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->5.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That respondent Judge’s arrogant and cavalier posture in
taking judicial notice purportedly as a matter of public knowledge a mere
newspaper account that the President had announced the lifting of foreign
exchange restrictions as basis for his assailed order of dismissal is highly
irregular, erroneous and misplaced.  For
the respondent judge to take judicial notice thereof even before it is
officially released by the Central Bank and its full text published <span style="">as </span>required by law to be effective
shows his precipitate action in utter disregard of the fundamental precept of
due process which the People is also entitled to and exposes his gross
ignorance of the law, thereby tarnishing public confidence in the integrity of
the judiciary.  How can the Honorable
Judge take judicial notice of something which has not yet come into force and
the contents, shape and tenor of which have not yet been published and
ascertained to be the basis of judicial action?  The Honorable Judge had miserably failed to “endeavor diligently
to ascertain the facts” in the case at bar contrary to Rule 3.02 of the Code of
Judicial Conduct, constituting Grave Misconduct;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->6.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That respondent Judge did not even ha(ve) the prudence of
requiring first the comment of the prosecution on the effect of aforesaid
Central Bank Circular/Monetary Board resolution on the pending cases before
dismissing the same, thereby denying the Government of its right to due
process;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->7.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That the lightning speed with which respondent Judge acted to
dismiss the cases may be gleaned from the fact that such precipitate action was
undertaken despite already scheduled continuation of trial dates set in the
order of the court (the prosecution having started presenting its evidence <span style="">x x x) </span>dated August 11, 1992 to
wit:  August 31, September 3, 10, 21,
&amp; 23 and October 1, 1992, all at 9:30 o’clock in the morning, in brazen
disregard of all notions of fair play, thereby depriving the Government of its
right to be heard, and clearly exposing his bias and partiality; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->8.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->That, in fact, the motive of respondent Judge in dismissing
the case without even waiting for a motion to quash filed by the counsel for
accused has even placed his dismissal Order suspect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to a resolution of this Court dated September 8, <span style="">1992, </span>respondent judge filed his
comment,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>contending, <i style=""><span style="">inter alia</span></i><span style="">, </span>that
there was no need to await publication of the Central Bank (CB) circular
repealing the existing law on foreign exchange controls for the simple reason
that the public announcement made by the President in several newspapers of
general circulation lifting foreign exchange controls was total, absolute,
without qualification, and was immediately effective; that having acted only on
the basis of such announcement, he cannot be blamed for relying on the
erroneous statement of the President that the new foreign exchange rules
rendered moot and academic the cases filed against Mrs. Marcos, and which was
corrected only on August 17, 1992 but published in the newspapers on August 18,
1992, and only after respondent judge had issued his order of dismissal dated
August 13, 1992; that the President was ill-advised by his advisers and,
instead of rescuing the Chief Executive from embarrassment by assuming
responsibility for errors in the latter’s announcement, they chose to toss the
blame for the consequence of their failures to respondent judge who merely
acted on the basis of the announcements of the President which had become of
public knowledge; that the “saving clause” under CB Circular No. 1353
specifically refers only to pending actions or investigations involving violations
of CB Circular No. 1318, whereas the eleven cases dismissed involved charges
for violations of CB Circular No. 960, hence the accused cannot be tried and
convicted under a law different from that under which she was charged; that
assuming that respondent judge erred in issuing the order of dismissal, the
proper remedy should have been an appeal therefrom but definitely not an
administrative complaint for his dismissal; that a mistake committed by a judge
should not necessarily be imputed as ignorance of the law; and that a “court
can reverse or modify a doctrine but it does not show ignorance of the justices
or judges whose decisions were reversed or modified” because “even doctrines
initiated by the Supreme Court are later reversed, so how much more for the
lower courts?”</p>

<p class="BODY">He further argued that no hearing was necessary since the
prosecution had nothing to explain because, as he theorized, “What explanation
could have been given?  That the
President was talking ‘through his hat’ (to use a colloquialism) and should not
be believed?  That I should wait for the
publication (as now alleged by complainants), of a still then non-existent CB
circular?  <span style="">x x x </span>As it turned out, CB Circular No. 3153 (sic) does not affect
my dismissal order because the said circular’s so-called saving clause does not
refer to CB Circular 960 under which the charges in the dismissed cases were
based;” that it was discretionary on him to take judicial notice of the facts
which are of public knowledge, pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 129; that the
contention of complainants that he acted prematurely and in indecent haste for
basing his order of dismissal on a mere newspaper account is contrary to the
wordings of the newspaper report wherein the President announced the lifting of
controls as an accomplished fact, not as an intention to be effected in the
future, because of the use of the present perfect tense or past tense “has
lifted,” not that he “intends to lift,” foreign exchange controls.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, respondent judge asseverates that complainants who are
officers of the Department of Justice, violated Section 6, Rule 140 of the
Rules of Court which provides that “proceedings against judges of first
instance shall be private and confidential” when they caused to be published in
the newspapers the filing of the present administrative case against him; and
he emphasizes the fact that he had to immediately resolve a simple and pure
legal matter in consonance with the admonition of the Supreme Court for speedy
disposition of cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their reply<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
supplemental reply,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
complainants aver that although the saving clause under Section 16 of CB
Circular No. 1353 made specific reference to CB Circular No. 1318, it will be
noted that Section 111 of Circular No. 1318, which contains a saving clause
substantially similar to that of the new circular, in turn refers to and
includes Circular No. 960.  Hence,
whether under Circular No. 1318 or Circular No. 1353, pending cases involving
violations of Circular No. 960 are excepted from <span style="">the coverage thereof.  Further,
it is alleged that the precipitate dismissal of the eleven cases, without
according the prosecution the opportunity to file </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">motion to quash or a comment, or even to show
cause why the cases against accused Imelda R. Marcos should not be dismissed, is
clearly reflective of respondent’s partiality and bad faith.  In effect, respondent judge acted as if he
were the advocate of the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 9, 1993, this Court issued a resolution referring the
complaint to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report and
recommendation, pursuant to Section 7, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court, <span style="">as </span>revised,
there being no factual issues involved.  The <span style="">corresponding report and
recommendation,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> dated February 14, 1994, was submitted by
Deputy Court Administrator Juanito A. Bernad, with the approval of Court</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Administrator Ernani Cruz-Paño.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned order<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> of
respondent judge reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>These eleven (11) cases are for Violation of Central Bank Foreign
Exchange Restrictions as consolidated in CB Circular No. 960 in relation to the
penal provision of Sec. 34 of R.A. 265, as amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused Mrs. Imelda R. Marcos pleaded not guilty to all these
cases; apparently the other accused in some of these cases, Roberto S.
Benedicto, was not arrested and therefore the Court did not acquire
jurisdiction over his person; trial was commenced as against Mrs. Marcos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His Excellency, the President of the Philippines, announced on
August 10, 1992 that the government has lifted all foreign exchange restrictions
and it is also reported that Central Bank Governor Jose Cuisia said that the
Monetary Board arrived at such decision (issue of the Philippine Daily
Inquirer, August 11, 1992 and issue <span style="">of </span>the
Daily Globe of the same date).  The
Court has to give full confidence and credit to the reported announcement of
the Executive Department, specially from the highest official of that
department; the Courts are charged with judicial notice of matters which are of
public knowledge, without introduction of proof, the announcement published in
at least the two newspapers cited above which are reputable and of national
circulation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Per several cases decided by the Supreme Court (People vs. Alcaras,
56 Phil. 520, People vs. Francisco, 56 Phil. 572, People vs. Pastor, 77 Phil.
1000, People vs. Crisanto Tamayo, 61 Phil. 225), among others, it was held that
the repeal of a penal law without re-enactment extinguishes the right to
prosecute or punish the offense committed under the old law and if the law
repealing the prior penal law fails to penalize the acts which constituted the
offense defined and penalized in the repealed law, the repealed law carries
with it the deprivation of the courts of jurisdiction to try, convict and
sentence persons charged with violations of the old law prior to <span style="">its </span>repeal.  Under the aforecited decisions this doctrine applies to special
laws and not only to the crimes punishable in the Revised Penal Code, such <span style="">as </span>the Import Control Law.  The Central Bank Circular No. 960 under
which the accused Mrs. Marcos is charged is considered as a penal law because
violation thereof is penalized with specific reference to <span style="">the provision of Section 34 of Republic Act
265, which penalizes violations of Central Bank Circular No. 960, produces the
effect cited in the Supreme Court decisions and since according to the
decisions that repeal deprives the Court of jurisdiction, this Court </span><i style="">motu proprio</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">dismisses all the
eleven (11) </span><span style="">cases as </span><span style="">aforestated in the caption, for not to do so
opens this Court to charges of trying cases over which it has no more
jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This order was subsequently assailed in a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
filed with the Court of Appeals, entitled “People of the Philippines vs. Hon. Manuel
T. Muro, Judge, RTC of Manila, Br. 54 and Imelda R. Marcos,” docketed as
CA-G.R. SP No. 29349.  When required to
file her comment, private respondent Marcos failed to file any.  Likewise, after the appellate court gave due
course to the petition, private respondent was ordered, but again failed
despite notice, to file an answer to the petition and to show cause why no writ
<span style="">of preliminary injunction should
issue.  Eventually, on April 29, 1993,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> setting aside the order of August 13, 1992,
and reinstating Criminal Cases Nos. 92-101959 to 92-101969.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In finding that respondent judge acted in excess of jurisdiction
and with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the order of dismissal, the
appellate court held that:</p>

<blockquote>The order was issued <i style="">motu
proprio</i><span style="">, i.e., </span>without any
motion to dismiss filed by counsel for the accused, without giving an
opportunity for the prosecution to be heard, and solely on the basis of
newspaper reports announcing that the President has lifted all foreign exchange
restrictions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The newspaper report is not the publication required by law in
order that the enactment can become effective and binding.  Laws take effect <span style="">after fifteen days following the completion of their publication in the
Official Gazette or in a newspaper of general circulation unless it is
otherwise provided (Section 1, Executive Order No. 200).  The full text of CB Circular 1353, series of
1992, entitled ‘Further Liberalizing Foreign Exchange Regulation’ was published
in the August 27, 1992 issue of the Manila Chronicle, the Philippine Star and
the Manila Bulletin.  Per certification
of the CB Corporate Affairs Office, CB Circular No. 1353 took effect on
September 2 <span style="">x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering that respondent judge admittedly had not seen the
official text of CB Circular No. 1353, he was in no position to rule
judiciously on whether CB Circular No. 960, under which the accused Mrs. Marcos
is charged, was already repealed by CB Circular No. 1353.  <span style="">x x
x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A cursory reading of the <span style="">x
x x </span>provision would have readily shown that the repeal of the
regulations on non-trade foreign exchange transactions is not absolute, as
there is a provision that with respect to violations of former regulations that
are the subject of pending actions or investigations, they shall be governed by
the regulations existing at the time the cause of action (arose).  Thus his conclusion that he has lost
jurisdiction over the criminal cases is precipitate and hasty.  Had he awaited the filing of a motion to
dismiss by the accused, and given opportunity for the prosecution to
comment/oppose the same, his resolution would have been the result of
deliberation, not speculation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
judicial notice rests on the wisdom and discretion of the courts.  The power to take judicial notice is to be
exercised by courts with caution; care must be taken that the requisite
notoriety exists; and every reasonable doubt on the subject should be promptly
resolved in the negative.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Generally speaking, matters of judicial notice have three
material requisites:  (1) the matter
must be one of common and general knowledge; (2) it must be well and
authoritatively settled and not doubtful or uncertain; and (3) it must be known
to be within the limits of the jurisdiction of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The principal guide in determining what facts may be assumed to be judicially
known is that of notoriety.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced by
public records and facts of general notoriety.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To say that a court will take judicial notice of a fact is merely
another way of saying that the usual form of evidence will be dispensed with if
knowledge of the fact can be otherwise acquired.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> This
is because the court assumes that the matter is so notorious that it will not
be disputed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
But judicial notice is not judicial knowledge.  The mere personal knowledge of the judge is not the judicial knowledge
of the court, and he is not authorized to make his individual knowledge of a
fact, not generally or professionally known, the basis of his action.  Judicial cognizance is taken only of those
matters which are “commonly” known.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Things of “common knowledge,” of which courts take judicial
notice, may be matters coming to the knowledge of men generally in the course
of the ordinary experiences of life, or they may be matters which are generally
accepted by mankind as true and are capable of ready and unquestioned
demonstration.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, facts which are universally known, and which may be found in
encyclopedias, dictionaries or other publications, are judicially noticed,
provided they <span style="">are </span>of such
universal notoriety and so generally understood that they may be regarded as
forming part of the common knowledge of every person.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, in the guise of exercising discretion and on
the basis of <span style="">a mere </span>newspaper
account which is sometimes even referred to as hearsay evidence twice removed,
took judicial notice of the supposed lifting of foreign exchange controls, a
matter which was not and cannot be considered of common knowledge or of general
notoriety.  Worse, he took cognizance of
an administrative regulation which was not yet in force when the order of
dismissal was issued.  Jurisprudence
dictates that judicial notice cannot be taken of a statute before it becomes
effective.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason is simple.  A law which is
not yet in force and hence, still inexistent, cannot be of common knowledge
capable of ready and unquestionable demonstration, which is one of the
requirements before a court can take judicial notice of <span style="">a </span>fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, it was impossible for respondent judge, and it was
definitely not proper for him, to have taken cognizance of CB Circular No.
1353, when the same was not yet in force at the time the improvident order of
dismissal was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Central Bank Circular No.
1353, which took effect on September 1, 1992, further liberalized the foreign
exchange regulations on receipts and disbursements of residents arising from
non-trade and trade transactions.  Section 16 thereof provides for a saving clause, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 16.  <i>Final
Provisions of CB Circular No. 1318.</i><span style="">  - </span>All the provisions in Chapter X of
CB Circular No. 1318 insofar as they are not inconsistent with, or contrary to
the provisions of this Circular, shall remain in full force and effect:  Provided, however, that any regulation on
non-trade foreign exchange transactions which has been repealed, amended or
modified by this Circular, violations of which are the subject of pending
actions or investigations, shall not be considered repealed insofar as such pending
actions or investigations are concerned, it being understood that as to such
pending actions or investigations, the regulations existing at the time the
cause of action accrued shall govern.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge contends that the saving clause refers only to
the provisions of Circular No. 1318, whereas the eleven criminal cases he
dismissed involve a violation of CB Circular No. 960.  Hence, he insists, Circular No. 960 is deemed repealed by the new
circular and since the former is not covered by the saving clause in the
latter, there is no more basis for the charges involved in the criminal cases
which therefore warrant a dismissal of the same.  The contention is patently unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the second part of the saving clause in Circular No.
1353 explicitly provides that <span style="">“</span><i style=""><span style="">any</span></i><span style=""> </span>regulation on non-trade foreign
transactions which has been repealed, <span style="">amended
or modified by this Circular, <i>violations of </i></span><i>which are the
subject of pending actions or investigations</i><span style="">, </span><span style="">shall not be
considered repealed insofar as such pending actions or investigations are
concerned, it being understood that as to such pending actions or
investigations, the </span><i style="">regulations
existing at the time the cause of action accrued shall govern</i><span style="">.” </span><span style="">The terms of the circular are clear and unambiguous and leave no room
for interpretation.  In the case at bar,
the accused in the eleven cases had already been arraigned, had pleaded not
guilty to the charges of violations of Circular No. 960, and said cases had
already been set for trial when Circular No. 1353 took effect.  Consequently, the trial court </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">supposed to proceed with the hearing of the
cases in spite of the existence of Circular No. 1353.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, had respondent judge only bothered to read a little
more carefully the texts of the circulars involved, he would have readily
perceived and known that Circular No. 1318 also contains a substantially
similar saving clause as that found in Circular No. 1353, since Section 111 of
the former provides:</p>

<blockquote>Section 111.  <i style=""><span style="">Repealing
clause</span></i><span style="">.  - </span>All existing provisions
of Circulars 365, 960 and 1028, including amendments thereto, with the
exception of the second paragraph of Section 68 of Circular 1028, as well as
all other existing Central Bank rules and regulations or parts thereof, which
are inconsistent with or contrary to the provisions of this Circular, are
hereby <span style="">repealed or modified
accordingly:  Provided, however, that
regulations, violations of which are the subject of pending actions or
investigations, shall be considered repealed insofar as such pending actions or
investigations are concerned, it being understood that as to such pending
actions or investigations, the regulations existing at the time the cause of
action accrued shall govern.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It unequivocally appears from the section above quoted that although
Circular No. 1318 repealed Circular No. 960, the former specifically excepted
from its purview all cases covered by the old regulations which were then
pending at the time of the passage of the new regulations.  Thus, any reference made to Circular No.
1318 necessarily involves and affects Circular No. 960.</p>

<p class="BODY">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said that
next in importance to the duty of rendering a righteous judgment is that of
doing it in such a manner as will beget no suspicion of the fairness and
integrity of the judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> This
means that a judge should not only render a just, correct and impartial
decision but should do so in such a manner as to be free from any suspicion as
to its fairness and impartiality and as to his integrity.  While a judge should possess proficiency in
law in order that he can competently construe and enforce the law, it is more
important that he should act and behave in such a manner that the parties
before him should have confidence in his impartiality.  Thus, it is not enough that he decides cases
without bias and favoritism.  Nor is it
sufficient that he in fact rids himself of prepossessions.  His actuations should moreover inspire that
belief.  Like Caesar’s wife, a judge
must not only be pure but beyond suspicion<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it has always heretofore been the rule that in
disposing of controverted cases, judges should show their full understanding of
the case, avoid the suspicion of arbitrary conclusion, promote confidence in
their intellectual integrity and contribute useful precedents to the growth of
the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
A judge should be mindful that his duty is the application of general law to
particular instances, that ours is a government of laws and not of men, and
that he violates his duty as a minister of justice under such a system if he seeks
to do what he may personally consider substantial justice in a particular case
and disregards the general law as he knows it to be binding on him.  Such action may have detrimental
consequences beyond the immediate controversy.  He should administer his office with due regard to the integrity of the
system of the law itself, remembering that he is not a depository of arbitrary
power, but a judge under the sanction of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
These are immutable principles that go into the very essence of the task of
dispensing justice and we see no reason why they should not be duly considered
in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assertion of respondent judge that there was no need to await
publication of Circular No. 1353 for the reason that the public announcement
made by the President in several newspapers of general circulation lifting
foreign exchange controls is total, absolute, without qualification, and
immediately effective, is beyond comprehension.  As a <span style="">judge of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, respondent is supposed to be well-versed in the
elementary legal mandates <span style="">on </span>the
publication of laws before they take effect.  It is inconceivable that respondent should insist on an altogether
different and illogical interpretation of an established and well-entrenched
rule if only to suit his own personal opinion and, as it were, to defend his
indefensible action.  It was not for him
to indulge or even to give the appearance of catering to the at-times human
failing of yielding to first impressions.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> He having done so, in the face of the
foregoing premises, this Court is hard put to believe that he indeed acted in
good faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">IV. This is not a simple case of a misapplication or erroneous
interpretation of the law.  The very act
of respondent judge in altogether dismissing sua sponte the eleven criminal
cases without even a motion to quash having been filed by the accused, and
without at least giving the prosecution the basic opportunity to be heard on
the matter by way of a written comment or on oral argument, is not only a blatant
denial of elementary due process to the Government but is palpably indicative
of bad faith and partiality.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The avowed desire of respondent judge to speedily dispose of the
cases as early as possible <span style="">is </span>no license for abuse of judicial power and discretion,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
nor does such professed objective, even if true, justify a deprivation of the
prosecution’s right to be heard and a violation of its right to due process of
law.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lightning speed, to borrow the words of complainants, with
which respondent judge resolved to dismiss the cases without the benefit of <span style="">a </span>hearing
and without reasonable notice to the prosecution inevitably opened him to
suspicion of having acted out of partiality for the accused.  Regardless of how carefully he may have
evaluated changes in the factual situation and legal standing of the cases, as
a result of the newspaper report, the fact remains that he gave the prosecution
no chance whatsoever to show or prove that it had strong evidence of the guilt
of the accused.  To repeat, he thereby
effectively deprived the prosecution of its right to due process.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
More importantly, notwithstanding the fact that respondent was not sure of the
effects and implications of the President’s announcement, <span style="">as </span>by his
own admission he was in doubt whether or not he should dismiss the cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
he nonetheless deliberately refrained from requiring the prosecution to comment
thereon.  In <span style="">a </span>puerile defense of his action,
respondent judge can but rhetorically ask:  “What explanation could have been given?  That the President was talking ‘through his hat’ and should not
be believed?  That I should wait for the
publication of a still then non-existent CB Circular?” The pretended cogency of
this ratiocination cannot stand even the minutest legal scrutiny.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In order that bias may not be imputed to a judge, he should have
the patience and circumspection to give the opposing party a chance to present
his evidence even if he thinks that the oppositor’s proofs might not be
adequate to overthrow the case for the other party.  A display of petulance and impatience in the conduct of the trial
<span style="">is </span>a
norm of conduct which is inconsistent with the “cold neutrality of an impartial
judge.”<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
At the very least, respondent judge acted injudiciously and with unjustified
haste in the outright dismissal of the eleven cases, and thereby rendered his
actuation highly dubious.</p>

<p class="BODY">V. It bears stressing that the questioned order of respondent
judge could have seriously and substantially affected the rights of the
prosecution had the accused invoked the defense of double jeopardy, considering
that the dismissal was ordered after arraignment and without the consent of
said accused.  This could have spawned
legal complications and inevitable delay in the criminal proceedings, were it
not for the holding of the Court of Appeals that respondent judge acted with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.  This saved the day for the People since in
the absence of jurisdiction, double jeopardy will not set in.  To stress this point, and as a <i style=""><span style="">caveat</span></i><span style=""> </span>to trial
courts against falling into the <span style="">same </span>judicial error, we reiterate what we
have heretofore declared:</p>

<blockquote>It <span style="">is
</span>settled doctrine that double jeopardy cannot be invoked against this
Court’s setting <span style="">aside of the trial
court’s judgment of dismissal or acquittal where the prosecution which
represents the sovereign people in criminal cases is denied due process.  </span><span style="">x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where the prosecution is deprived of a fair opportunity to
prosecute and prove its case, its right to due process is thereby violated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cardinal precept is that where there is a violation of basic
constitutional rights, courts are ousted of their jurisdiction.  Thus, the violation of the State’s right to
due process raises a serious jurisdictional issue <span style="">x x x </span>which cannot be glossed over or disregarded at will.  Where the denial of the fundamental right of
due process is apparent, <span style="">a </span>decision rendered in disregard of that right is void for lack
of jurisdiction <span style="">x x x.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is also significant that accused Marcos, despite due notice,
never submitted either her comment on or an answer to the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
as required by the Court of Appeals, nor was double jeopardy invoked in her
defense.  This serves to further
underscore the fact <span style="">that </span>the
order of dismissal was clearly unjustified and erroneous.  Furthermore, considering that the accused is
a prominent public figure with a record of influence and power, it is not easy
to allay public skepticism and suspicions on how said dismissal order came to
be, to the consequent although undeserved discredit of the entire judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">VI. To hold a judge liable for rendering a manifestly unjust
order through inexcusable negligence or ignorance, it must be clearly shown
that although he has acted without malice, he failed to observe in the
performance of his duty <span style="">that </span>diligence,
prudence and care which the law is entitled <span style="">to exact in the rendering of any public service.  Negligence and ignorance are inexcusable if
they imply a manifest injustice which cannot be explained by a reasonable
interpretation, and even though there is a misunderstanding </span>or error <span style="">of the law applied, it nevertheless results
logically and reasonably, and in a very clear and indisputable manner, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the notorious violation of the legal precept.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, a cursory perusal of the comment filed by
respondent judge reveals that no substantial argument has been advanced in
plausible justification of his act.  He
utterly failed to show any legal, factual, or even equitable justification for
the dismissal of the eleven criminal cases.  The explanation given is no explanation at <span style="">all.  </span>The
strained and fallacious submissions therein do not speak well of respondent and
cannot but further depreciate <span style="">his </span>probity
as a judge.  On this point, it is best
that pertinent unedited excerpts from his comment<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">be </span>quoted by way of graphic
illustration and emphasis:</p>

<blockquote>On the alleged ignorance of the law imputed to me, it is said that
I issued the Order dismissing the eleven (11) cases against Mrs. Imelda R. Marcos
on the basis of newspaper reports referred to in paragraph 2 of the letter
complaint without awaiting the official publication of the Central Bank
Circular.  Ordinarily a Central Bank
Circular/Resolution must be published in the Official Gazette or in a newspaper
of general circulation, but the lifting of “all foreign exchange controls” was
announced by the President of the Philippines WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS; as
published in the Daily Globe, August 11, 1992” the government has lifted ALL
foreign exchange controls,” and in the words of the Philippine Daily Inquirer
report of the same date “The government yesterday LIFTED the LAST remaining
restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, <span style="">x x </span>x” (emphasis in both quotations supplied) not only the
President made the announcement but also the Central Bank Governor Jose Cuisia
joined in the announcement by saying that “the Monetary Board arrived at the
decision after noting how the ‘partial liberalization’ initiated early this
year worked.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>Therefore, because of the ABSOLUTE lifting of ALL restrictions on
foreign exchange transactions, there was no need to await the publication of
the repealing circuar of the Central Bank.  The purpose of requiring publication of laws and administrative rules
affecting the public is to inform the latter as to how they will conduct their
affairs and how they will conform to the laws or the rules.  In this particular case, with the total
lifting of the controls, there is no need to await publication.  It would have been different if the circular
that in effect repealed Central Bank Circular No. 960, under which the accused
was charged in the cases dismissed by me, had provided for penalties and/or
modified the provisions of said Circular No. 960.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Complainants state that the lifting of controls was not yet in
force when I dismissed the cases but it should be noted that in the report of
the two (2) newspapers aforequoted, the President’s announcement of the lifting
of controls was stated in the present perfect tense (Globe) or past tense
(Inquirer).  In other words, it has
already been lifted; the announcement did not say that the government INTENDS
to lift all foreign exchange restrictions but instead says that the government
“has LIFTED all foreign exchange controls,” and in the other newspaper cited
above, that “The government yesterday lifted the last remaining restrictions on
foreign exchange transactions”.  The
lifting of the last <span style="">remaining exchange
regulations effectively cancelled or repealed Circular No. 960.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The President, who is the Chief Executive, publicly announced the
lifting of all foreign exchange regulations.  The President has within his control directly or indirectly the Central
Bank of the Philippines, the Secretary of Finance being the Chairman of the
Monetary Board which decides the policies of the Central Bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No official bothered to correct or qualify the President’s
announcement of August 10, published the following day, nor made an
announcement that the lifting of the controls do not apply to cases already
pending, not until August 17 (the fourth day after my Order, and the third day
after report of said order was published) and after the President said on
August 17, reported in the INQUIRER’S issue of August 18, 1992, that the “new
foreign exchange rules have nullified government cases against Imelda R.
Marcos, telling reporters that the charges against the widow of former
President Marcos ‘have become moot and academic’ because of new ruling(s) which
allow free flow of currency in and out of the country” (Note, parenthetically,
the reference to “new rules” not to “rules still to be drafted”).  The INQUIRER report continues:  “A few hours later, presidential spokeswoman
Annabelle Abaya said, ramos (sic) had ‘corrected himself’.” “He had been
belatedly advised by the Central Bank Governor <span style="">Jose </span>Cuisia and Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon that the
Monetary Board Regulation excluded from its coverage all criminal cases pending
in court and such a position shall stand legal scrutiny’, Mrs. Abaya, said.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>I will elaborate on two points:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the President was wrong in making the
August 10 announcement (published in August 11, 1992, newspapers) and in the
August 17 announcement, SUPRA, and thus I should not have relied on the
Presidential announcements, and there is basis to conclude that the President
was at the very least ILL-SERVED by his financial and legal advisers, because
no one bothered to advise the President to correct his announcements, not until
August 17, 1992, a few hours after the President had made another announcement <span style="">as </span>to the charges against Imelda
Marcos having been rendered moot and academic.  The President has a lot of work to do, and is not, to my knowledge, a
financier, economist, banker or lawyer.  It therefore behooved his subalterns to give him timely (not “belated”)
advice, and brief him on matters of immediate and far-reaching concerns (such
as the lifting of foreign exchange controls, designed, among others to
encourage the entry of foreign investments).  Instead of rescuing the Chief Executive from embarrassment by assuming
responsibility for errors in the latter’s announcement, these advisers have
chosen to toss the blame for the consequence of their failing to me, who only
acted on the basis of announcements of their Chief, which had become of public
knowledge.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x  </span>x  x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court strongly feels that it has every right to assume and
expect that respondent judge is possessed with more than ordinary credentials
and qualifications to merit his appointment <span style="">as a </span>presiding judge in the Regional
Trial Court of the National Capital Judicial Region, stationed in the City of
Manila itself.  It is, accordingly,
disheartening and regrettable to note the nature of the arguments and the kind
of logic that respondent judge would want to impose on this Court
notwithstanding the manifest lack of cogency thereof.  This calls to mind similar scenarios and how this Court reacted
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In one case, an RTC Judge was administratively charged for
acquitting the accused of a violation of CB Circular No. 960 despite the fact
that the accused was apprehended with US$355,349.00 while boarding a plane for
Hongkong, erroneously ruling that the State must first prove criminal intent to
violate the law and benefit from the illegal act, and further ordering the
return of US$3,000.00 out of the total amount seized, on the mistaken
interpretation that the<span style=""> CB circular
exempts such amount from seizure.  Respondent judge therein was ordered dismissed from the government
service for gross incompetence and ignorance of the law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the Court dismissed another RTC judge, with
forfeiture of retirement benefits, for gross ignorance of the law and for
knowingly rendering an unjust order or judgment when he granted bail to an
accused charged with raping an 11-year old girl, despite the contrary
recommendation of the investigating judge, and thereafter <span style="">granted the motion to dismiss the case
allegedly executed by the complainant.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the adjudication of controversies, exhibits indifference to and even disdain
for due process and the rule of law, applies the law whimsically, capriciously

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BELLOSILLO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">In other jurisdictions, it is generally accepted that judges are
not accountable by way of either civil suit or discipline for their official
acts, even if clearly erroneous.  Thus,
open disregard of statutes, rules, and cases has been held to be protected
official <span style="">activity.  </span>Although a decision may seem so
erroneous as <span style="">to </span>raise doubts
concerning a judge's integrity or physiological condition, absent extrinsic
evidence, the decision itself is insufficient to establish a case against the
judge.  The rule is consistent with the
concept of judicial independence.  <span style="">An </span>honest judge, if he were denied the
protection of the extrinsic evidence requirement, might become unduly cautious
in his work, since he would be subject to discipline based merely upon the
inferences to be drawn from an erroneous decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In our jurisdiction, the law is no different.  Thus, this Court has repeatedly held that –</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x x </span>x it is a
fundamental rule of long standing that a judicial officer when required to
exercise his judgment or discretion is not criminally liable for any error he
commits provided he acts in good faith, that in the absence of malice or any
wrongful conduct <span style="">x x x </span>the judge
cannot be held administratively responsible x x x for no one, called upon to
try the facts or interpret the law in the process of administering justice can
be infallible in his judgment, and to hold a judge administratively accountable
for every erroneous ruling or decision he renders x <span style="">x x </span>would be nothing short of harassment or would make his
position unbearable.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A judge cannot be subjected to liability - civil, criminal, or
administrative - for any of his official acts, no matter how erroneous, as long
as he acts in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> He cannot
be held to account or answer, criminally, civilly, or administratively, for an
erroneous decision rendered by him in good faith.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> As a
matter of public policy, in the absence of fraud, dishonesty, or corruption,
the acts of a judge <span style="">in </span>his
judicial capacity are not subject to disciplinary action, even though such acts
are erroneous.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a general principle of the highest importance to proper administration of
justice that a judicial officer, in exercising the authority vested in him,
shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without apprehension of personal
consequences to himself.  This concept
of judicial immunity rests upon consideration of public policy, its purpose
being to preserve the integrity and independence of the judiciary.<span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> This
being settled doctrine, there is no choice but to apply it to the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts:  Respondent
Manuel T. Muro, a native of Masbate, Masbate, was appointed on 6 November 1986
as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Br. 54, by then President
Corazon C. Aquino.  A product of the
College of Law, Far Eastern University, he graduated valedictorian in 1955,
magna cum laude, and placed sixth in the Bar Examinations.  Now he is being charged with ignorance of
the law, grave misconduct and violation of Rules 2.01, 3.01 and 3.02 of the
Code of Judicial Conduct<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> for
dismissing <i style=""><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>the eleven (11) cases filed by the
Department of Justice Panel of Prosecutors against Ms. Imelda Romualdez Marcos
for Violation of Central Bank Foreign Exchange Restrictions after President
Fidel V. Ramos had announced, which was published in newspaper reports, the
lifting of all foreign exchange restrictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion finds respondent judge guilty of gross
ignorance of the law and imposes upon him the supreme penalty of dismissal from
the service, forfeiture of leave credits and retirement benefits, and
disqualification from reemployment in the government service.</p>

<p class="BODY">With all due respect to my esteemed colleagues, particularly to
the <i style="">ponente</i><span style=""> </span>who is a recognized authority on various fields of law, I
cannot help viewing the circumstances in a different light.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the order issued by respondent judge has
been reversed by the appellate court, which reversal has now become final for
failure of the accused to appeal therefrom; hence, no damage has been caused
except that complainants had to avail of a judicial remedy to correct the
mistake.  But, as adverted to, the
overturned order alone does not necessarily make respondent judge liable administratively,
much more civilly or criminally.  To be
answerable, the fault of the judge, if any, must be gross or patent, malicious,
deliberate or done in bad <span style="">faith.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Plainly said, fault in this regard may exist
only when the error appears to be deliberate or in bad faith.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, bad faith is imputed against respondent judge, first, for
insisting that "there was no need to await publication of Circular No.
1353 for the reason that the public announcement made by the President in
several newspapers of general circulation lifting foreign exchange controls is
total, absolute, without qualification, and immediately effective,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and, second, for "dismissing <i style="">sua
sponte</i><span style=""> </span>the eleven criminal <span style="">cases </span>without even a motion to quash
having been filed by the accused, and without at least giving the prosecution
the basic opportunity to be heard on the matter."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But, bad faith is the neglect or refusal to fulfill a duty, not
prompted by an honest mistake, but by some interested or sinister motive.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It implies breach of faith and willful failure to respond to plain and well
understood obligation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> It
does not simply<i style=""><span style=""> </span></i>connote bad judgment or negligence; it imports a dishonest
purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of wrong; it means breach
of <span style="">a </span>known
duty through some motive or interest or ill will.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, I cannot ascribe bad faith to respondent judge for I see
no insidious intentions on his part.  If
he insists that there really is no need to await the publication of Circular
No. 1353, as he does here, it merely shows that he sincerely believes that
there is indeed no necessity to await publication.  Whether his belief <span style="">is </span>erroneous or not is thus irrelevant.  Further, dismissing <i style=""><span style="">motu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>the eleven
criminal cases without affording the prosecution the opportunity to be heard on
the matter, erroneous though it may be, is not inescapably indicative of bad
faith.  The immediate dismissal of the
charges is a necessary consequence of the belief that since the restrictions
were lifted, no law was then being violated.  It is an elementary principle in procedural law and statutory
construction that the repeal of a penal law deprives the court of jurisdiction
to punish persons charged with a violation of the old law prior to its repeal.  Thus, where the crime no longer exists,
prosecution of the person charged under the old law cannot be had and the
action should be dismissed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, there is no reason why good faith should not be
attributed to respondent judge.  Good
faith means that the motive that actuated the conduct in question was in fact
what the actor ascribes to it, that is, that what he gives as his motive was in
truth his motive.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, if he honestly believes that the bases for the criminal charges against
accused have been eliminated and thus strikes down the information and
consequently dismisses the charges, respondent judge cannot be criminally,
civilly, or even administratively, held liable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Good faith and absence of malice, corrupt motives or improper
consideration are sufficient defenses protecting a judicial officer charged
with ignorance of the law and promulgation of an unjust decision from being
held accountable for errors of judgment.  This, on the premise that <span style="">no </span>one
called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the administration of
justice can be infallible.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge could not have seriously jeopardized the rights
of the prosecution, even if the accused invoked the defense of double jeopardy,
since the remedy of <i style=""><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>is very much available.<span style="">  </span>Precisely,
as has been pointed out <span style="">in </span>the
majority opinion, the defense of double jeopardy is unavailing when the
prosecution is denied due process.  This
is in fact the office of the prevailing doctrine - to correct indiscretions of
lower court judges - which does not necessarily make them personally
liable.  In fact, if respondent judge
was indeed in bad faith, he should have given the prosecution an opportunity to
be heard, and after a full-blown trial, acquitted the accused.  Then, the defense of double jeopardy would
have been proper and the accused would have gone scot?free.  Thus, in <b><span style="">Negado v. Judge Autajay</span></b><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court <span style="">affirmed the conclusions of the Investigating Justice of the Court of
Appeals that "[w]hen a person seeks administrative sanction against a judge
simply because he has committed an error in deciding the case against such
person, when such error can be elevated to </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">higher court for review and correction, the action of such person can
only be suspect."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To equate the failure of accused Marcos to comment on the
petition before the appellate court, and consequently invoke the defense of
double jeopardy, with the errancy of the assailed order,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
may be indulging in needless speculation.  And to imply that <span style="">the influence
of the accused who is a prominent public figure brought about the dismissal
order is simply not borne out by the records.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the challenged order of respondent judge can hardly be
considered as <b>grossly</b> erroneous to merit his dismissal.  For, while his reasoning may be erroneous,
as it turned out when the reversal of his decision by the appellate court
became final, it is not at all illogical as even the President of the Republic,
with his learned legal advisers, after learning of the dismissal of the cases
filed by his administration against the accused, was quoted as saying that Mrs.
<span style="">Marcos was an </span>"accidental"
beneficiary of the foreign exchange deregulation policy of his administration.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, President Fidel V. Ramos further said that "[t]he forex deregulation
applies to everybody <span style="">x x x x </span>Now
the cases filed by the government against Mrs. Marcos, numbering about 11 out
of 90 have become moot and academic because of the new regulations that have

But the cold fact is that every overturned decision provokes suspicion
especially from the successful appellant who feels certain that the lower court
indeed erred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that "[a] judge should be mindful that his
duty is the application of general law to a particular instance, that ours is a
government of laws and not of men, and that he violates his duty as minister of
justice under such system if he seeks to do what he may personally consider
substantial justice in a particular case and disregards the general law as he knows
it to be binding on him.  Such action
may have detrimental consequences beyond the immediate controversy.  He should administer his office with due
regard to the integrity <span style="">of </span>the
system of the law itself, remembering that he is not a depositary of arbitrary
power, but a judge under the sanction of <span style="">law.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As it has been said, he must interpret the
books, and not unload his ideas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But while a judge must decide in accordance with existing laws
and established jurisprudence, his own personality, character, convictions,
values, experiences and prejudices are only sublimely insignificant and
unconsciously dispensable.  In every
decision he makes, he is no more and no less human, his own beliefs,
perceptions and imperfections, as well as the laws he is bound to apply, all
having profound influence on his eventual choice.  Thus, Mr. Justice Cardozo of the Supreme Court of the United
States once wrote of judges:  "We
may try to see things as objectively as we please.  None the less, we can never see them with any eyes except our
own."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, time and again, lower court judges, if not reversed by the Court of
Appeals and this Court, have continued to set new trails in jurisprudence
without exactly conforming with what has been settled.  Yet, whether reversed or merely unregarded,
they do not receive displeasure from this Court; on the contrary, they remain
to be effective dispensers of everyday justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, there is no substantial proof, nay proof beyond
reasonable doubt, that respondent judge issued the assailed order in bad faith
or with conscious and deliberate intent to perpetrate an injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Justice Malcolm, speaking for this Court in<span style=""> </span><b style="">In

<p class="BODY">The law always imputes good faith to judicial action, and the
burden is on the one challenging the same to prove want of it.  Contraposed with the "exacting
standard" required, complainant-prosecutors in the instant case failed to
prove the absence of good faith on the part of respondent judge.  Consequently, the presumption that official
duty has been regularly performed stands.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I find it difficult to compare the instant case with those cited
in the majority opinion.  In<span style=""> </span><b style=""><span style="">Padilla v. Judge Dizon</span></b><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>respondent not only allowed the
accused to go scot-free, leaving the Commissioner of Customs without any relief
against the accused, the former likewise ordered the release of US$3,000.00 to
the accused.  Thus, respondent judge was
found guilty not only of gross ignorance of the law, but also of gross
incompetence, and grave and serious misconduct affecting his integrity and
efficiency, and was consequently dismissed from the service.  And, failing to learn a lesson from his earlier
administrative case, respondent judge, after his reinstatement, this time
erroneously acquitted the defendants in four (4) different cases of illegal
possession of firearms.  Finally the
Court said, <span style="">"</span>[w]hen it has
been clearly demonstrated, as in this case, not only once but four (4) times,
that the judge is either grossly incompetent or grossly ignorant of the penal
laws <span style="">x x x x </span>he
becomes unfit to discharge his judicial office.”<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Unlike former Judge Dizon, this is the first time respondent Judge Muro is
being administratively charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><b>Buenavista
v. Judge Garcia</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">the Court found </span>respondent guilty of
"serious misconduct, gross ignorance of the law, and knowingly rendering
an unjust order or judgment" for granting bail to an accused who was
charged with statutory rape, for "improper and immoral intervention in
brokering a compromise of the criminal cases" against the accused, and
thereafter for granting the motion to dismiss the rape case on the basis of an Affidavit
of Desistance allegedly executed by the victim who was then a minor.  Certainly, the actuations of the respondent
judge in the cited case are far worse than the complained indiscretions of
herein respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the proceedings
instituted against Judge </span>Jocson,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> he
was charged with a litany of administrative cases, six (6) in all, i.e., from
gross misconduct to gross ignorance of the law, to incompetence, to
partiality.  While not all the charges
were sufficiently proved, respondent judge was found to be "ignorant of
fairly elementary and quite <span style="">familiar
legal principles and administrative </span>regulations, (with) <span style="">x x x </span>a marked penchant for applying
unorthodox, even strange theories and concepts in the adjudication of
controversies, (and) exhibits indifference to, and even disdain for due process
and the rule of law, applies the law whimsically, capriciously, and
oppressively, and displays bias and partiality." The Court thus observed,
"[t]he different acts of misconduct proven against respondent judge
demonstrate his unfitness to remain in office and to continue to discharge the
functions and duties of a judge, and warrant the imposition on him of the
extreme sanction of dismissal from the service." There is nothing in the
records of the instant case which shows that respondent Judge Muro, like former
Judge Jocson, exhibits a pattern for applying pecant and unaccepted theories
which breed manifest and irreversible injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY">And, in <b>Uy </b><b><span style="">v. </span>Judge Dizon-Capulong</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>respondent aggravated her ignorance
of the <span style="">law </span>by
her refusal to abide by the Decision of the appellate court and later of this
Court, showing utter disrespect for and open defiance of higher courts.  Consequently, she was not only found guilty
of gross ignorance of the law, but also of grave and serious misconduct
prejudicial to the interest of the judicial service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrastingly, in a fairly recent case,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court merely imposed a fine of P10,000.00 on respondent judge who
entertained the petition for bail filed by the suspects prior to their actual
arrest, notwithstanding unrefuted allegations that the accused were allegedly
relatives of the congressman who "sponsored" the appointment of
respondent to the Judiciary.  In another
case,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court imposed a fine of P5,000.00 on respondent judge for ignorance of the
law and grave abuse of authority after he improperly issued a warrant of arrest
and set the case for arraignment, in disregard of proper procedure.  And, still in another,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court in dismissing the complaint
filed against respondent ruled that <span style="">a </span>judge cannot be condemned unless his error
is so gross and patent as to produce an inference of ignorance and bad faith or
that he knowingly rendered an unjust decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, there is no extrinsic evidence which shows that the
assailed order of respondent Judge Manuel T. Muro was inspired by a conscious
and corrupt intent to do a disservice and commit an atrocity, and thus his
dismissal is uncalled for.  Where there
is no clear indication from the records that the respondent's assailed decision
was inspired by corrupt motives or <span style="">a </span>reprehensible purpose, and while there may
be a misjudgment, but not a deliberate twisting of facts to justify the
assailed order, dismissal of respondent judge from the service is not proper.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Holding respondent judge liable for issuing the challenged order
may curtail the independence of judges and send the wrong signals to them who
are supposed to exercise their office without fear of reprisal, merely for
expressing their uncorrupted views.  Regretfully, litigants may suffer and gain eventual justice only after
costly and long-drawn-out appeals from erroneous decisions, but these are
necessary evils which must be endured to some extent lest judicial independence
and the growth of the law be stifled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unlike collegial courts which afford their members the luxury of
a deliberation, a trial judge in handing down his decisions must brave the
loneliness of his solitude and independence.  And, while this Court may slightly bend backwards if only to avoid
suspicion of partiality and cliquism to a brother in the profession, it must
also step forward and take the lead to defend him against unsubstantiated
tirades which put to shame and disgrace not only the magistrate on trial but
the entire judicial system as well.  As
champion - at other times tormentor - of trial and appellate judges, this Court
must be unrelenting in weeding the judiciary of unscrupulous judges, but it
must also be quick in dismissing administrative complaints which serve no other
purpose than to harass them.  In
dismissing judges from the service, the Court must be circumspect and
deliberate, lest it penalizes them for exercising their independent judgments
handed <span style="">down </span>in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge has impressive academic and professional
credentials which, experience shows, are no longer easy to recruit for the
judicial service.  Above all, he has
served the judiciary with creditable distinction.  It is unfeeling, if not unfair, to purge him without extrinsic
evidence of bad faith and then shatter his hopes of ascending someday the
judicial hierarchy which, after all, is the ultimate dream of every sacrificing
trial judge.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
