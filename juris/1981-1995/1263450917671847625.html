				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The city fiscal and an assistant fiscal of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
filed in the city court on <st1:date month="9" day="15" year="1980">September
 15, 1980</st1:date> an information charging <span class="SpellE">Rogelim</span>
Yee with serious slander by deed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
alleged therein that in the afternoon of July 14, 1980 Yee <span style="">with the deliberate intent of bringing one
Ofelia V. <span class="SpellE">Torralba</span>, a fourth-year student, into
discredit, disrepute and contempt, willfully attacked and assaulted her and
inflicted a contusion in her left cheek in the presence of her visitors,
teachers </span>and classmates to her great embarrassment and inconvenience
(Criminal Case No. 11500).</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal certified that he conducted the corresponding
preliminary investigation and that there was probable cause or reasonable
ground to believe that serious slander by deed was committed by Yee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recommended bail in the amount of P600.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affidavits of the complainant and her witnesses were attached
to the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge,
instead of issuing a warrant of arrest, as has been the time-honored practice,
conducted an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> preliminary
examination by scanning the record to determine once more the existence of
probable cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a perusal of the affidavits, he concluded that the offense
committed was either slight slander by deed committed in the heat of anger or
slight physical injuries, a light felony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the information was filed sixty-four days after the offense was
committed, respondent judge dismissed the case <span class="SpellE"><u>sua</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>sponte</u></span> on the ground of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal order was issued on September
17, 1980 or two days after the filing of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge denied the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
motion for recon­sideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal
received a copy of the order of denial on <st1:date month="1" day="6" year="1981">January 6, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution failed to appeal the order of dismissal to this Court, a
procedure sanctioned by Republic Act No. 5440 in relation to section 5 of
Republic Act No. 5967, a 1969 law which expanded the jurisdiction of <span style="">city </span>courts and which up to this time
is not known to some lawyers and judges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Long after the issuance of the order of dismissal, or on <st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1981">March 17, 1981</st1:date>, the city fiscal and
his assistant filed in this Court the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> wherein they assailed the order of dismissal on the ground
of <span style="">grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the fiscals' petition cannot be entertained because,
as expressly indicated in sections 1 and 2, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court,
generally, <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> are not proper when ordinary
appeal is available as an ade­quate remedy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a rule, <i>certiorari</i> is not a substitute for an appeal (3
Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court 176).</p>

<p class="BODY">Where an appeal would have been an adequate remedy but it was
lost through petitioner's inexcusable negligence, <i>certiorari</i> is not in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again, this Court dis­missed
petitions for <i>certiorari</i> to annul decisions or final orders which could
have, but were not, appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
dismissed because <i>certiorari</i> cannot take the place of an appeal (3
Moran’s Comments on the Rules of Court 178, citing <span class="SpellE">Profeta</span>
vs. Gutierrez David, 71 Phil. 582; Republic vs. <span class="SpellE">Maglanoc</span>,
123 Phil. 508).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the exercise of our supervisory jurisdic­tion and for
the guidance of the parties in this case and in similar cases in the future
involving the issuance of the warrant of arrest after the information is filed
in court, we will resolve the issues raised herein (See Alfonso vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 80 Phil. 407).</p>

<p class="BODY">To justify the dismissal order, respondent judge alleged that his
practice has been that after <span class="GramE">an information</span> is filed
by the fiscal, he would conduct a preliminary examination to <span style="">determine probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That examination would be <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> because the fiscal usually did not file with
the information a motion for hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After such preliminary examination, he either <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> dismissed the information for lack of
probable cause or he gave it due course (p. 54, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, he dismissed the information since he "was not
satisfied of the existence of a probable cause because the crime committed by
the accused had already been extin­guished by prescription" and "it
was his legal duty not only to refuse to issue the warrant of arrest but to
dismiss the case" (p. 55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge’s position is that the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
preli­minary investigation under Presidential Decree No. 911 does not preclude
him from exercising his "legal duty" "to exercise his judicial
power of determining before issuing the corresponding warrant of arrest"
the existence of pro­bable cause (p. 59, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, respondent judge, before issuing the warrant of
arrest, is clothed with the prerogative of ascer­taining probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That power is granted to him by section 3, Article
IV (Bill of Rights) of the Constitution which provides that <span style="">"</span><span style="">no</span> warrant of arrest shall issue
except upon pro­bable cause to be determined by the judge, or such other res­ponsible
officer as may be authorized by law, after examina­tion under oath or
affirmation of the complainant and the wit­nesses he may produce".</p>

<p class="BODY">The power is also granted to any judge authorized to conduct
preliminary investigations and respondent judge is given that authority by
section 6, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court and by the charter of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Butuan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Republic Act No. 523.</p>

<p class="BODY">But that Power does not include the authority to dismiss outright
the information if the judge believes that there is no probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge should require the fiscal to pre­sent
additional evidence to show probable cause.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the fiscal refuses to do so, then the case may be dismissed for
"lack of prosecution" (<span class="SpellE">Amarga</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abbas</span>, 98 Phil. 739, 743).</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal is also authorized to determine probable cause not
only by the Bill of Rights but also by the law or rule empowering him to
conduct preliminary investigations (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 2 and 14,
Rule 112, Rules of Court; Sec. 1687 of <span style="">the
Revised Administrative Code as amended by Republic Acts Nos. 732 and 1799 and
Republic Act No. 5180 as amended by Presidential Decrees Nos. 77 and 911).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal is a "responsible officer authorized by law"
within the meaning of section 3 of the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His determination of probable cause is a
sufficient justifi­cation for the issuance of a warrant of arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it was held that "in a clash of views between the
judge who did not investigate and the fiscal who did, or between the fiscal and
the offended party or the defendant, those of the <span class="SpellE">fiscal’s</span>
should normally prevail" (People vs. Pineda, 65 O. G. 2595, 20 SCRA 748,
756).</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the settled practice is that after the fiscal has
conducted a preliminary investigation and filed <span class="GramE">an
information</span>, the Court of First Instance issue s the warrant of arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, the Court of First Instance does not conduct any
preliminary examination to determine probable cause or to confirm the <span class="SpellE">fiscal"s</span> determination thereof for that would be a
time-wasting ritual or a duplicitous proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The time- saving practice has been for the judge (muni­cipal,
city or Court of First Instance) to rely on the prelimi­nary investigation
conducted by the fiscal as the basis for issuing the warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That practice is supported by the presumption
that the fiscal performed his duties re­gularly and competently (<span class="SpellE">Edillon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Narvios</span>,
Administrative Case No. 1753, August 21, 1980, 99 SCRA 174) And that practice
existed even under the old Constitution when section 1(3) of the Bill of Rights
did not contain the terms "warrant <span style="">of
arrest" and "such other responsible officer as may be authorized by
law".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that, as a rule, a trial judge should not hold another
preliminary examination to determine probable cause in case the fiscal has
filed <span class="GramE">an information</span> and certi­fied that he has
conducted the requisite preliminary inves­tigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That certification means that there is a <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case against the accused and that the issuance of a warrant of
arrest is justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, the <span class="SpellE">fiscal"s</span>
certification should be a suffi­cient compliance with the constitutional
requirement of pro­bable cause as a <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> for the
issuance of a warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it was held that the filing of <span class="GramE">an information</span> in the
city court by the city fiscal implies that the fiscal had conducted the requisite
preliminary investigation so that no further investigation would have to be
made by the city court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Astero</span> vs. Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City, L-26741, July 31, 1969, 28 SCRA 1078, 1084;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span>, L-46228, January 17, 1978, 81
SCRA 95, 98).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This case illustrates the mischief or prejudice arising from the
act of the city judge in duplicating the preliminary examination held by the
fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, respondent judge on the
pretext of determining probable cause arrived at the con­clusion (before
arraignment) that the criminal liability of the accused was extinguished by
prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">What respondent judge actually did was not to verify whether the <span class="SpellE">fiscal’s</span> determination of probable cause was correct but to
find out whether the criminal liability of the accused was already
extinguished, which is a different matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Extinction of criminal liability presupposes not merely probable cause
but the guilt of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the investigating fiscal gave accused Yee a
chance to be heard at the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not submit any counter-affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was furnished by the fiscal with a copy of
the latter’s resolution wherein <span style="">he
found that there existed a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case for grave slander by
deed against the accused. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Yee did not
controvert that resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case against him was terminated because of the precipitate or
premature order of dismissal issued by res­pondent judge on his own volition on
the basis of his inde­pendent assessment of <span class="GramE">Yee' s</span>
criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already noted,
that order was rendered two days after the filing of the information.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ocaya</span>, L-47448, May 17,
1978, 83SCRA 218, the fiscal, after holding a preliminary investigation,
charged the three accused with <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <u>graves</u>
in the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead
of issuing a warrant of arrest, the district judge dismissed the case because
in his opinion the crime committed was only <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span> since it was stated in the medical
certificate that the <span class="GramE">victim' s</span> injuries would require
medical attendance from seven to ten days.</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification contradicted the victim’s affidavit that she
was incapacitated from her customary labor for more than thirty days and the
allegation in the information that she suffered a disfigurement in the
face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court’s order of
dismissal was assailed in this Court by means of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held that the trial court prematurely dismissed the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal order was set aside
and the case was assigned to another trial judge who was directed to issue a
warrant of arrest and thereafter to proceed with the arraign­ment and trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ocaya</u></span> case, the trial judge did not advance the
contention put forward in this case by respondent city judge </span>that the
court where the information is filed should hold another preliminary
examination before issuing the warrant of arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although in the instant case we find that the city court erred in
dismissing the case on its own motion on the con­troversial ground of prescription,
nevertheless, the petition has to be dismissed because no appeal was seasonably
made from the dismissal order and <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> are not
substitutes for an appeal that had lapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

holding thus certiorari, even in instances of lack of jurisdiction or grave
abuse of discretion, cannot as a rule be a substitute for appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I reserve my <span class="GramE">opinion in</span>
the other consideration nor with in the main opinion. <o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
