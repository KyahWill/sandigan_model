decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> of
the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. CV-10124, entitled "Thelma <span class="SpellE">Yniguez</span>, et al., plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
vs. Queens Supermarkets, Inc., et al., defendants-appellants" annulling
the decision of the RTC, Branch 147, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">**</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="12">4 December 1978</st1:date>,
petitioners Thelma, <span class="SpellE">Rothel</span>, Rachel and <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Yniquez</span>,
filed a complaint for dam­ages before the Court of First Instance (now Regional
Trial Court) of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
docketed as Civil Case No. Pq-6831-PO, later re-docketed as Civil Case No. 3893
assigned to Branch 147, RTC, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, against
respondents Queens Supermarkets, Inc. (hereafter, Queens) located at Harrison
Plaza and Lourdes Cortez, its employee, for alleged disregard by the latter of
petitioner Thelma's honor and dignity, by accusing her of shoplifting a packet
of "<span class="SpellE">vetsin</span>", which accusation was later
found to be false by the officials of Queens.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of issues, the case was
set for pre­trial on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="9">18 September 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Queens was declared as in default
for failure of its counsel to appear on the scheduled date of pre-trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting on a second motion for reconsideration
filed by respondent, without opposition from petitioners, the default order was
set aside and pre-trial re-set to <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="5">8 May
 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="12">29 December 1983</st1:date>, the case was
dismissed for petitioners’ failure to prosecute, but reinstated on <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="6">1 June 1984</st1:date> upon motion by
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, pre-trial was terminated on <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="9">12 September 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was set for hearing on the merits on
<st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="10">18 October 1984</st1:date>. For lack
of material time, continuance was scheduled on <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="11">14 November 1984</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30
 a.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">What follows are the crucial events leading to the present <span class="GramE">petition.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 13
November 1984, one day before the scheduled date for continuance, counsel for
respondents filed an Urgent Motion for Postponement on the ground that he had
to attend on 14 November 1984 at 8:30 a.m. the trial of a murder case<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
before the Military Tribunal at Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the case was called on 14 November 1984,
the trial court issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the objection of Atty. Gonzales to the motion for
postponement of defendant, the same is denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On motion of plaintiff, thru counsel, plaintiff is allowed to
present evidence ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' counsel claims to have received a copy of the above
order only on 20 March 1985 when he made an inquiry with the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of 14 November 1984, petitioners (plaintiffs
below) presented evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, on
the basis of which, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered judgment on 11 March
1985, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof reading as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby renders
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendants, ordering the
latter to pay the former, <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>, the following:</blockquote>

representing moral damages;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. The amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before the Court of Appeals, respondents
raised five (5) issues which may be summed up as grave abuse of discretion of
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in hastily disposing of the case without properly
notifying respondents of the denial of their motion for post­ponement, then,
awarding excessive and scandalous damages, in violation of procedural due
process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals held:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, for being infirmed by lack of procedural due
process, the judgment appealed from is hereby annulled and set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conform­ably, the case is hereby remanded for
continuation of trial and further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is hereby ordered to give
defendants-appellants ample opportunity to cross-examine witness Thelma <span class="SpellE">Yniguez</span>, whose testimony should remain; and thereafter, to
present their own (defendants') evidence, without prejudice to the right of
plaintiffs to adduce additional and/or rebuttal proofs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only after both parties shall have completed
the <span class="SpellE">adducement</span> of their evidence and been afforded
the <span class="SpellE">ampliest</span> [sic] chance to litigate, shall the case
be decided by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost
against the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is the decision now questioned before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cases of this genre are quite unfortunate, for the time and
effort they extract from the appellate courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While the RTC Judge may have been correct in denying the respondents’
motion for postponement, for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
three (3) day notice rule, and in disallowing cross-examination of petitioners’
witness on 14 November 1984, as counsel for private respondents was absent and
could not just take for granted that his motion for postponement would be acted
upon favorably, yet, we fail to see any rhyme or reason why respondents’ right
to cross examine petitioners’ witness was disregarded altogether.</p>

<p class="BODY">For such omission of the trial judge, compounded by the failure
of his staff to properly and timely notify respondents' counsel of the denial
of his Motion for Postponement, wittingly or unwittingly, respondents were
denied due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this connection,
it is worth repeating that -</p>

<blockquote>"The Court has consistently maintained that although a speedy
determination of an action implies a speedy trial, speed is not the chief
objective of a trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Careful and
deliberate consideration for the administration of justice, a genuine respect
for the rights of all parties and the requirements of procedural due process
and an adherence to the Court's standing admo­nition that the discretion
granted judges in the granting or denial of motions for postponement and the
setting aside of denial orders pre­viously issued ‘should always be predicated
on the consideration that more than the mere convenience of the courts or of
the parties in the case, the ends of justice and fairness would be served
thereby’ are more important than a race to end the trial."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The decision of the Court
of Appeals in CA-G.R. No.</span> CV-10124 is AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let this case be remanded to the trial court
for further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents shall have the right to cross examine petitioners' witnesses, and
to present their own evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>RTC Judge
<span class="SpellE">Guadiz</span> and his staff are admonished to be more
punctilious in the performance of their duties so that the proceedings in cases
