<p class="BODY">The elemental question in labor law of whether or not an 
employer-employee relationship exis<span>t</span>s between petitioners - members 
of the "Brotherhood Labor Unit Movement of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>" 
(BLUM) and respondent San <span>Miguel <span class="GramE">Corporation,</span> is 
the main issue in this petition.<span>&nbsp; </span>The disputed decision of public 
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> Zamora, Presidential Assistant for 
Legal Affairs, contains a brief summary of the facts 
involved:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span>The</span> records disclose that 
on July 11, 1969, BLUM filed a complaint with the now defunct Court of 
Industrial Relations, charging San Miguel Corporation, and the following 
officers:<span>&nbsp; </span>Enrique <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>, Federico 
<span class="SpellE">Oñate</span>, Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, Jr., 
Ernesto Villanueva, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Bocaling</span> and <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cueto</span> of unfair labor 
practice as set forth in Section <span>4 (a), </span>sub-sections (1) and 
<span>(4) </span>of Republic Act No. 875 and of illegal dismissal.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It was alleged that respondents ordered the individual complainants to 
disaffiliate from the complainant union; and that management dismissed the 
individual complainants when they insisted on their union 
membership.<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"On their part, respondents moved for the dismissal of the complaint 
on the grounds that the complainants are not and have never been employees of 
respondent company but employees of the independent contractor; that respondent 
company has never had control <span>over the means and methods followed by the 
independent contractor who enjoyed full authority to hire and control said 
employees; and that the individual complainants are barred by <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> from asserting that they are employees of 
respondent company.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"While pending with the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR), 
pleadings and testimonial and documentary evidences were duly presented, 
although the actual hearing was delayed by several postponements.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The dispute was taken over by the National Labor Relations Commission 
(NLRC) with <span class="GramE">the</span> decreed abolition of the CIR and the 
hearing of the case <span class="SpellE">intransferably</span> commenced on 
<st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="9">September 8, 
1975</st1:date>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="2">February 9, 
1976</st1:date>, Labor Arbiter Nestor C. Lim found for <span class="GramE">complainants which was</span> concurred in by the NLRC in a decision 
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1976</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> awarded, however, was 
reduced by NLRC to the equivalent of one (1) year salary.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"On appeal, the Secretary in a decision dated <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1977</st1:date>, set aside the NLRC ruling, stressing 
the absence of an employer-employee relationship as borne out by the records of 
the case.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners strongly argue that there exists an 
employer-employee relationship between them and the respondent company and that 
they were dismissed for unionism, an act constituting unfair labor practice "for 
which respondents must be made to answer".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Unrebutted</span> evidence and testimony on 
record establish that the petitioners are workers who have been employed at the 
San Miguel <span class="SpellE">Parola</span> Glass Factory since 1961, averaging 
about seven (7) years of service at the time of their termination.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They worked as "<span class="SpellE"><em>cargadores</em></span>" or "<span class="SpellE"><em>pahinantes</em></span>" at the SMC Plant loading, unloading, 
piling or <span class="SpellE">palleting</span> empty bottles and wooden shells to 
and from company trucks <span>and warehouses.<span>&nbsp; </span>At times, they 
accompanied the company trucks on their delivery routes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioners first reported for work to 
Superintendent-in-Charge <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They 
were issued gate passes signed by <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span> and were 
provided by the respondent company with the tools, equipment and paraphernalia 
used in the loading, unloading, piling and hauling operation.</p>
<p class="BODY">Job orders emanated from <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The orders are then transmitted to 
an assistant-officer-in-charge.<span>&nbsp; </span>In turn, the assistant informs the 
warehousemen and checkers regarding the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter, 
thereafter, relays said orders to the <span class="SpellE">capatazes</span> or 
group leaders who then give orders to the workers as to where, when and what to 
load, unload, pile, pallet or clean.</p>
<p class="BODY">Work in the glass factory was neither regular nor continuous, 
depending wholly on the volume of bottles manufactured to be loaded and 
unloaded, as well as the business activity of the company.<span>&nbsp; </span>Work 
did not necessarily mean a full eight (8) hour day for the petitioners.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, work, at times, exceeded the eight (8) hour day and necessitated 
work on Sundays and holidays.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this, they were neither paid 
overtime nor compensation for work on Sundays and holidays.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners were paid every ten (10) days on a piece rate basis, 
that is, according to the number of cartons and wooden shells they were able to 
load, unload, or pile.<span>&nbsp; </span>The group leader notes down the number or 
volume of work that each individual worker has accomplished.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>This is then made the basis of a report or statement which is 
compared with the notes of the checker and warehousemen as to whether or not 
they tally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Final approval of report is by officer-in-charge <span class="SpellE">Camahort</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The pay check is given to the group 
leaders for encashment, distribution, and payment to the petitioners in 
accordance with payrolls prepared by said leaders.<span>&nbsp; </span>From the total 
earnings of the group, the group leader gets a participation or share of ten 
(10%) percent plus an additional amount from the earnings of each 
individual.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioners worked exclusively at the SMC plant, never having 
been assigned to other companies or departments of SMC plant, even when the 
volume of work was at its minimum.<span>&nbsp; </span>When any of the glass furnaces 
suffered a breakdown, making a shutdown necessary, the petitioners' work was 
temporarily suspended.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the petitioners would return to 
work at the glass plant.</p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime in January, 1969, the petitioner workers — numbering one 
hundred and forty (140) organized and affiliated themselves with the petitioner 
union and engaged in union activities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Believing themselves 
entitled to overtime and holiday pay, the petitioners pressed management, airing 
other grievances such as being paid below the minimum wage law, in human 
treatment, being forced to borrow at usurious rates of interest and to buy 
raffle tickets, co<span>erced by withholding their salaries, and salary 
deductions made without their consent.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, their gripes and 
grievances were not heeded by the respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="2">February 6, 
1969</st1:date>, the petitioner union filed a notice of strike with the Bureau 
of Labor Relations in connection with the dismissal of some of its members who 
were allegedly castigated for their union membership and warned that should they 
persist in continuing with their union activities they would be dismissed from 
their jobs.<span>&nbsp; </span>Several conciliation conferences were scheduled in 
order to thresh out their differences.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1969</st1:date>, union member Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Dipad</span> was dismissed from work.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the 
scheduled conference on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="2">February 19, 
1969</st1:date>, the complainant union through its officers headed by National 
President <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Portugal</st1:place></st1:country-region>, 
Sr<span class="GramE">.,</span> presented a letter to the respondent company 
containing proposals and/or labor demands together with a request for 
recognition and collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>San Miguel refused to bargain with the petitioner union 
alleging that the workers are not their employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="2"><span>February 20, 1969</span></st1:date><span>, all the petitioners 
were dismissed from their jobs and, thereafter, denied entrance to respondent 
company's glass factory despite their regularly reporting for work.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A complaint for illegal dismissal and unfair labor practice was filed by 
the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The case reaches us now with the same issues to be resolved 
as when it had begun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The question of whether an employer-employee relationship exists 
in a certain situation continues to bedevil the courts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some 
businessmen try to avoid the bringing about of an employer-employee relationship 
in their enterprises because that <span class="SpellE">judidical</span> relation 
spawns obligations connected with workmen's compensation, social security, <span class="SpellE">medicare</span>, minimum wage, termination pay, and 
unionism.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Mafinco</em></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">Trading 
Corporation v. Ople</span><span>, 70 SCRA 
139).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In determining the existence of an employer-employee relationship, 
the elements that are generally considered are the following:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) 
the selection and engagement of <span>the employee; (b) the payment of wages; 
(c) the power of dismissal; and (d) the employer's power to control the employee 
with respect to the means and methods by which the work is to be 
accomplished.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is the so-called "control test" that is the most 
important element (<em>Investment Planning Corp. of the Phils. v. The Social 
Security System</em>, 21 SCRA 924; <span class="SpellE"><em>Mafinco</em></span><em> Trading Corp. v. Ople</em>, 
<em>supra</em>, and <em>Rosario Brothers, Inc. v. Ople,</em> 131 SCRA 
72).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Applying the above criteria, the evidence strongly indicates the 
existence of an employer-employee relationship between petitioner workers and 
respondent San Miguel Corporation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The respondent asserts that the 
petitioners are employees of the Guaranteed Labor Contractor, an independent 
labor contracting firm.</p>
<p class="BODY">The facts and evidence on record negate respondent SMC's 
claim.</p>
<p class="BODY">The existence of an independent contractor relationship is 
generally established by the following criteria:<span>&nbsp; </span>"whether or not 
the contractor is carrying on an independent business; the nature and extent of 
the work; the skill required; the term and duration of the relationship; the 
right to assign the performance of a specified piece of work; the control and 
supervision of the work to another; the employer's power with respect to the 
hiring, firing and payment of the contractor's workers; the control of the 
premises; the duty to supply the premises tools, appliances, materials and 
labor; and the mode, manner and terms of payment (56 CJS Master and Servant, 
<span>Sec. 3(2), 46; See also 27 AM. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jur</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> Independent Contractor, 
Sec. 5, 485 and <span class="GramE">Anne.,</span> 75 ALR 
7260727).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">None of the above criteria exists in the case at bar.</p>
<p class="BODY">Highly unusual and suspect is the absence of a written contract to 
specify the performance of a specified piece of work, the nature and extent of 
the work and the term and duration of the relationship.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
records fail to show that a large commercial outfit, such as the San Miguel 
Corporation, entered into mere oral agreements of employment or labor 
contracting where the same would involve considerable expenses and dealings with 
a large number of workers over a long period of time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite 
respondent company's allegations <span>not </span>an iota of evidence was 
offered to prove the same or its particulars.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such failure makes 
respondent SMC's stand subject to serious doubts.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span>Uncontroverted</span></span><span> is the 
fact that for an average of seven (7) years, each of the petitioners had worked 
continuously and exclusively for the respondent company's shipping and 
warehousing department.<span>&nbsp; </span>Considering the length of time that the 
petitioners have worked with the respondent company, there is 
</span><span>justification to conclude that they were engaged to perform 
activities necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the 
respondent, and the petitioners are, therefore regular employees <em>(Phil. 
Fishing Boat Officers and Engineers Union v. Court of Industrial Relations</em>, 
112 SCRA 159 and <em>RJL Martinez Fishing Corporation v. National Labor 
Relations Commission</em>, 127 SCRA 454).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As we have found in <em>RJL Martinez Fishing Corporation v. 
National Labor Relations Commission</em>, 
(<em>supra</em>):<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [T]he 
employer-employee relationship between the parties herein is not co-<span class="SpellE">terminous</span> with each loading and unloading job.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As earlier shown, respondents are engaged in the business of 
fishing.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, they have a fleet of fishing 
vessels.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under this situation, respondents' activity of catching 
fish is a continuous process and could hardly be considered as seasonal in 
nature.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that the activities performed by herein complainants, 
i.e. unloading the catch of tuna fish from respondents' vessels and then loading 
the same to refrigerated vans, are necessary or desirable in the business of 
respondents.<span>&nbsp; </span>This circumstance makes the employment of 
complainants a regular one, in the sense that it does not depend on any specific 
project or seasonable activity.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(NLRC Decision, 
p. 94, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)."</span></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>so</span></span><span> is it with petitioners in the case at 
bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, despite past shutdowns of the glass plant for 
repairs, the petitioners, thereafter, promptly returned to their jobs, never 
having been replaced, or assigned elsewhere until the present controversy 
arose.<span>&nbsp; </span>The term of the petitioners' employment appears 
indefinite.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Continuity and <span class="SpellE">habituality</span> of petitioners' work bolsters their claim of 
employee status <span class="SpellE"><em>vis-a-vis</em></span> respondent 
company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Even under the assumption that a contract of employment had 
indeed been executed between respondent SMC and the alleged labor contractor, 
respondent's case will, nevertheless, fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Section 8, Rule VIII, Book III of the Implementing Rules of 
the Labor Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Job contracting.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— There is 
job contracting permissible under the Code if the following conditions are 
met:</blockquote>
<blockquote>"(1)<span>&nbsp; </span>The contractor carries on an independent business 
and undertakes the contract work on his own account under his own responsibility 
according to his own manner and method, free from the control and direction of 
his employer or principal in all matters connected with the performance of the 
work except as to the results thereof; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<blockquote>"(2<span class="GramE">)<span>&nbsp; </span>The</span> contractor has 
substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, 
work premises, and other materials which are necessary in the conduct of his 
business."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>We find that Guaranteed and Reliable Labor contractors have 
neither substantial capital nor investment to qualify as an independent 
contractor under the law.<span>&nbsp; </span>The premises, tools, equipment and 
paraphernalia used by the petitioners in their jobs are admittedly all supplied 
by respondent company.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is only the manpower or labor force 
which the alleged contractors supply, suggesting the existence of a "labor-only" 
contracting scheme prohibited by law </span>(Article 106, 109 of the Labor Code; 
Section 9(b), Rule VIII, Book III, Implementing Rules and Regulations of the 
Labor Code).<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, even the alleged contractor's office, which 
consists of a space at respondent company's warehouse, table, chair, typewriter 
and cabinet, are provided for by respondent SMC.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is therefore 
clear that the alleged contractors have no capital outlay involved in the 
conduct of its business, in the maintenance thereof or in the payment of its 
workers' salaries.</p>
<p class="BODY">The payment of the workers' wages is a critical factor in 
determining the actuality of an employer-employee relationship whether between 
respondent company and petitioners or between the alleged independent contractor 
and petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is important to emphasize that in a truly 
independent contractor-<span class="SpellE">contractee</span> relationship, the 
fees are paid directly to the manpower agency in lump sum without indicating or 
implying that the basis of such lump sum is the salary per worker multiplied by 
the number of workers assigned to the company.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is the rule in 
<em>Social Security System v. Court of Appeals</em> (39 SCRA 629, 635).</p>
<p class="BODY">The alleged independent contractors in the case at bar were paid a 
lump sum representing only the salaries the workers were entitled to, arrived at 
by adding the salaries of each worker which depend on the volume of work they 
had accomplished individually.<span>&nbsp; </span>These are based on payrolls, 
reports or statements prepared by the workers' group leader, warehousemen and 
checkers, where they note down the number of cartons, wooden shells and bottles 
each worker was able to load, unload, pile or pallet and see whether they 
tally.<span>&nbsp; </span>The amount paid by respondent <span>company to the alleged 
independent contractor considers no business expenses or capital outlay of the 
latter.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nor is the profit or gain of the alleged contractor in the 
conduct of its business provided for as an amount over and above the workers' 
wages.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, the alleged contractor receives a percentage from 
the total earnings of all the workers plus an additional amount corresponding to 
a percentage of the earnings of each individual worker, which, perhaps, accounts 
for the petitioners' charge of unauthorized deductions from their salaries by 
the respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Anent the argument that the petitioners are not employees as 
they worked on piece basis, we merely have to cite our rulings in <span class="SpellE"><em>Dy</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Keh</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Beng</em></span><em> v. International Labor and Marine Union of 
the Philippines</em> (90 SCRA 161), as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"'[C]<span class="SpellE">ircumstances</span> must be construed to 
determine indeed if payment by the piece is just a method of compensation and 
does not define the essence of the relation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Units of time ... and 
units of work are in establishments like respondent (sic) just yardsticks 
whereby to determine rate of compensation, to be applied whenever agreed 
upon.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot construe payment by the piece where work is done 
in such an establishment so as to put the worker completely at liberty to turn 
him out and take in another at pleasure.'"</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Article 106 of the Labor Code provides the legal effect of a 
labor-only contracting scheme, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the 
person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer 
who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the 
latter were directly employed by him."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Firmly establishing respondent SMC's role as employer is the 
control exercised by it over the petitioners — that is, control in the means and 
methods/manner by which petitioners are to go about their work, as well as in 
disciplinary measures imposed by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Because of the nature of the petitioners' work as <span class="SpellE"><em>cargadores</em></span> or <span class="SpellE"><em>pahinantes</em></span>, supervision as to the means and 
</span>manner of performing the same is practically <span class="GramE">nil</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For, how many ways are there to load and 
unload bottles and wooden shells?<span>&nbsp; </span>The mere concern of both 
respondent SMC and the alleged contractor is that the job of having the bottles 
and wooden shells brought to and from the warehouse be done.<span>&nbsp; </span>More 
evident and pronounced is respondent company's right to control in the 
discipline of petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Documentary evidence presented by the 
petitioners establish respondent SMC's right to impose disciplinary measures for 
violations or infractions of its rules and regulations as well as its right to 
recommend transfers and dismissals of the piece workers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
inter-office memoranda submitted in evidence prove the company's control over 
the petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>That respondent SMC has the power to recommend 
penalties or dismissal of the piece workers, even as to <span class="SpellE">Abner</span> <span class="SpellE">Bungay</span> who is alleged by SMC 
to be a representative of the alleged labor contractor, is the strongest 
indication of respondent company's right of control over the petitioners as 
direct employer.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence to show that the alleged 
labor contractor had such right of control or much less had been there to 
supervise or deal with the petitioners.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petitioners were dismissed allegedly because of the 
shutdown of the glass manufacturing plant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent company 
would have us believe that this was a case of retrenchment due to the closure or 
cessation of operations of the establishment or undertaking.<span>&nbsp; </span>But 
such is not the case here.<span>&nbsp; </span>The respondent's shutdown was merely 
temporary, </span>one of its furnaces needing repair.<span>&nbsp; </span>Operations 
continued after such repairs, but the petitioners had already been refused entry 
to the premises and dismissed from respondent's service.<span>&nbsp; </span>New 
workers manned their positions.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is apparent that the closure of 
respondent's warehouse was merely a ploy to get rid of the petitioners, 
<span>who </span>were then agitating the respondent company for benefits, 
reforms and collective bargaining as a union.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no showing 
that petitioners had been remiss in their obligations and inefficient in their 
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">jos</span></span> to warrant their 
separation.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As to the charge of unfair labor practice because of SMC's 
refusal to bargain with the petitioners, it is clear that the respondent company 
had an existing collective bargaining agreement with the IBM union which is the 
recognized collective bargaining representative at the respondent's glass 
plant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There being a recognized bargaining representative of all 
employees at the company's glass plant, the petitioners cannot merely form a 
union and demand bargaining.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Labor Code provides the proper 
procedure for the recognition of unions as sole bargaining 
representatives.<span>&nbsp; </span>This must be followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE,</span></b><span> IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, 
</span><span>the petition </span><span>is GRANTED.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>The San 
Miguel Corporation is hereby ordered to <span>REINSTATE </span>petitioners, with 
three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, 
where reinstatement is no longer possible, the respondent SMC is ordered to pay
