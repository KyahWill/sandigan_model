<p class="BODY">During the incumbency of Rene <span class="SpellE">Espina</span> as 
provincial governor of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> as vice-governor 
and Pablo P. Garcia, Reynaldo M. Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span> 
S. <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> as members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>, said 
officials adopted Resolution No. 990 which appropriated funds "for the 
maintenance and repair of provincial roads and bridges and for the operation and 
maintenance of the office of the provincial engineer and for other 
purposes".<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(L-44591 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 34-37).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In said resolution, the provincial government of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> under the aforementioned officials, declared its policy 
"to mechanize the maintenance and repair of all roads and bridges of the 
province (including provincial roads and bridges receiving national aid 'JJ'), 
to economize in the expenditure of its Road and Bridge Fund for the maintenance 
and repair of provincial roads and bridges receiving national aid 'JJ' and to 
adopt a more comprehensive, systematic, efficient, progressive and orderly 
operation and maintenance of the Office of the Provincial 
Engineer".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>To implement said policy, the provincial board 
re</span>solved to abolish around thirty positions<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the salaries of which were paid from the 
'JJ' Road and Bridge Fund thus doing away with the <span class="SpellE"><u><span>caminero</span></u></span><span> 
</span>(pick-shovel-wheelbarrow) system.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, around 200 
employees of the province were eased out of their respective jobs and, to 
implement the mechanization program in the maintenance of roads and bridges, the 
provincial government purchased heavy equipment worth P4<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, contrary to its declared 
policy to economize, the provincial administration later on hired around one 
thousand new employees, renovated the office of the provincial engineer and 
provided the latter with a Mercedes-Benz car (Decision in CA-G.R. No. 49328-R, 
L-44591 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 37).</p>
<p class="BODY">Aggrieved by these turn of events, the employees whose positions 
were abolished filed separate petitions for <i>mandamus</i>, damages and 
attorney's fees aimed at the annulment of Resolution No. 990, their 
reinstatement and the recovery of damages.<span>&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned 
provincial officials who, together with the provincial auditor, provincial 
treasurer, provincial engineer and the province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, were named respondents in said action, were sued "both 
in their official and personal" capacities as a result of their alleged "unjust, 
oppressive, illegal and malicious' acts (Petition, Record in Civil Case No. 
<span class="GramE">R-10704, p. 3).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In Civil Case No.</span> R-10704, the Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> declared Resolution No. 990 
null and void and ordered the respondent officials to re-create the positions 
abolished, to provide funds therefore, to reinstate the 56 petitioners headed by 
Jose <span class="SpellE">Abala</span>, and to pay them back salaries.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>For "lack of legal and factual basis", no damages were awarded to 
petitioners and no pronouncement as to attorney's fees were made as the 
petitioners had agreed to pay their lawyers 30% of whatever amount they would 
receive as back salaries (L-44591 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
33-34).</p>
<p class="BODY">All the parties appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 
49328-R).<span>&nbsp; </span>Eventually, said appellate court, through its First 
Division, affirmed the lower court's <span>decision with the modification that 
respondents were ordered to pay jointly and severally in their "individual and 
personal capacity" P1,000.00 moral damages to each of the petitioners 
considering that the case involved a <em>quasi-delict</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><span>(L-44591 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 54).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From that decision, <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> G. 
<span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, interposed an appeal to this Court (G.R. No. 
<span class="GramE">L-44484).</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> then filed their own petition for review (G.R. No. 
<span class="GramE">L-44591).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>But before <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, <em>et al.</em> could file said petition, the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>province</span></st1:placetype><span> of 
</span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span>Cebu</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> and its 
<span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> 
filed their own petition for review questioning that portion of the appellate 
court's decision which ordered the reinstatement with back salaries of the 
dismissed employees.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Said petition, which was 
docketed as G.R. No.</span> L-<span class="GramE">44572,</span> was dismissed by 
this Court for lack of merit in the resolution of </span><st1:date month="10" day="25" year="1976"><span>October 25, 1976</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Entry of judgment was made on </span><st1:date month="11" day="24" year="1976"><span>November 24, 
1976</span></st1:date><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Meanwhile, dismissed employees <span class="SpellE">Froilan</span> <span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span> Luna, who also had filed their own petition for 
<i>mandamus</i> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, elevated their case to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. 
No. <span class="GramE">SP-04649).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>In its decision, the Court 
of Appeals' Ninth Division followed the ruling of its First Division in CA?G.R. 
No. 48328-R, held that the wrong committed by the respondent public officials 
was a <em>quasi-delict</em>, and ordered the reinstatement with back salaries of 
<span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna and the payment <em>in 
solidum</em></span> <span>by respondent public officials of P1</span><span class="GramE"><span>,000.00</span></span> <span>each to <span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna as moral damages plus P1,000.00 as 
attorney's fees.<span>&nbsp; </span>With the exception of <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, the respondent public officials appealed to this 
</span>Court (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-44842).</span><span>&nbsp; 
</span>Subsequently, the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Assistant Provincial 
Attorney, representing the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and its 
<span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span>, 
also appealed to this Court from that decision (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-44894).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="28" year="1977">March 28, 
1977</st1:date>, this Court resolved to consolidate G.R. Nos. L-44484, L-44842, 
L-44591 and L-44894 considering that said cases involve the same issues and 
factual background (L-44591 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
344).</p>
<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna filed a 
motion to dismiss L-44894 and L-44842.<span>&nbsp; </span>They alleged that as the 
petition in L-44572 had been dismissed on October 25, 1976, said two cases 
should likewise be dismissed because they, together with the private respondents 
in L-44572 who, like them, were also permanent appointees to their respective 
positions, "were separated from the service on the <em>same date by </em>the<em> 
same petitioners</em>" (L-44894 <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 140) and 
therefore, the petitions in L-44894 and L-44842 were barred by the rule of 
<em>stare decisis</em>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The motion to dismiss, however, was noted in the resolution of 
<st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1978">February 17, <span class="GramE">1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> it appearing that 
said two cases had already been submitted for decision (L-44894 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 148; L-44842 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 139).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna filed another motion to dismiss L-44894 
but after the petitioners had filed their comment thereon, said motion to 
dismiss was also noted in the resolution of <st1:date month="2" day="22" year="1981">February 22, 1981</st1:date> (L-44894 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 186).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We find, however, that <span class="SpellE">Frondoso's</span> 
and Luna's contention that L-44894 should be dismissed is meritorious.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in L-44894 and L-44572 are the 
same.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>In fact, the prayer in the petition in L-44894 is 
virtually a verbatim reiteration of that in L-44572.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
allegation of petitioner <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and 
its <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> 
that the question of jurisdiction was not raised in L-44572 (L-44894 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 150) cannot successfully save L-44894 
from dismissal.<span>&nbsp; </span>In their petition, the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and its <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> merely 
argued that the Court of Appeals did not acquire jurisdiction over the case, 
considering that <span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna's appeal was 
perfected after the expiration of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> 
period and that their brief was filed one month too late.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, the trend of the rulings of this Court in matters 
pertaining to the timeliness of the perfection of an appeal is to afford every 
party-litigant amplest opportunity to present their case "for the proper and 
just determination of his cause, freed from the constraints of technicalities." 
<span class="GramE">(<em>Rodriquez vs. Court of Appeals</em>, L-37522, November 
28, 1975, 68 SCRA 262).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Applying the above ruling to this 
case, the Court of Appeals may not, therefore, be faulted for assuming 
jurisdiction over the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Frondoso</span> and Luna.</p>
<p class="BODY">Hence, with respect to L-44894, this Court is bound by the 
dismissal of L-44572 and so L-44894 should likewise be dismissed, as it is 
hereby dismissed.</p>
<p class="BODY">Proceeding now to resolve the issue, common to L-44484, L-44591 
and L-44842, which is whether or not <span class="SpellE">Espina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, Garcia, <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> and <span class="SpellE">Carillo</span> are personally liable for damages for adopting a 
resolution which abolished positions to the detriment of the occupants thereof, 
this <span>Court has held that, at least, in principle, a public officer by 
virtue of his office alone, is not immune from damages in his personal capacity 
arising from illegal acts done in bad faith.<span>&nbsp; </span>A different rule 
would sanction the use of public office as a tool of oppression (<span class="SpellE"><em>Tabuena</em></span><em> vs. Court of Appeals</em>, L-16290, 
October 31, 1961, 3 SCRA 413).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thus, in <em>Correa vs. CFI of Bulacan</em>, L-46096, 
</span><st1:date month="7" day="30" year="1979"><span>July 30, 
1979</span></st1:date><span>, 92 SCRA 312, <span class="GramE">We</span> held 
personally liable a mayor who illegally dismissed policemen even if he had 
relinquished his position.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therein, <span class="GramE">We</span> 
held that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"A public officer who commits a tort or other wrongful act, done in 
excess or beyond the scope of his duty, is not protected by his office and is 
personally liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> like any private individual 
(<em>Palma vs. Graciano</em>, 99 Phil. 72, 74; <span class="SpellE"><em>Carreon</em></span><em> vs. Province of Pampanga</em>, 99 Phil. 
808).<span>&nbsp; </span>This principle of personal liability has been applied to 
cases where a public officer removes another officer or discharges an employee 
wrongfully, the reported cases saying that by reason of non-compliance with the 
requirements of law in respect to removal from office, the officials were acting 
outside of their official authority (<em>Stiles vs. Lowell</em>, 233 Mass. 174, 
123 NE 615, 4 ALR 1365, cited in 63 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 2d. 
770)."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>We hold that the petitioners in the instant three cases are 
personally liable for damages because of their precipitate dismissal of 
provincial employees through an ostensibly legal means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court of Appeals, whose factual findings are binding on 
this Court, found that the provincial employees concerned were "eased out 
because of their party affiliation".<span>&nbsp; </span><em>i.e.</em>, they belonged 
to the Liberal Party whose presidential candidate then was Sergio <span class="SpellE">Osmena</span>, Jr. (CA Decision in G.R. No. 49328-R, p. 6, L-44591 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 38).<span>&nbsp; </span>Such act of the 
petitioners reflected their malicious intent to do away with the followers of 
the rival political party so as to accommodate their own <span class="SpellE">proteges</span> who, it turned out, even outnumbered the dismissed 
employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Indeed, municipal officers are liable for damages if they act 
maliciously or wantonly, and if the work which they perform is done rather to 
injure an individual than to discharge a public duty (56 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 2d 334, citing <span class="SpellE">Yealy</span> V. Fink, 
43 Pa 212).<span>&nbsp; </span>As we have held in <span class="SpellE"><em>Vda</em></span><em>. de&nbsp; Laig vs. Court of Appeals</em>, 
L-26882, April 5, 1978, 82 SCRA 294, 307-308, a public officer is civilly liable 
for failure to observe honesty and good faith in the performance of their duties 
as public officers or for <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> or negligently 
causing damage to another (Article 20, Civil Code) or for <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> causing loss or injury to another in a manner that 
is contrary to morals, good customs and/or public policy (Article 21, New Civil 
Code).</p>
<p class="BODY">Neither can petitioners shield themselves from liability by 
invoking the ruling in the cases of <span class="SpellE"><em>Carino</em></span><em> vs. Agricultural Credit and Cooperative 
Financing Administration</em>, L-23966, May 22, 1969, 28 SCRA 268.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In those cases, the erring public officials were sued in their official 
capacities whereas in the instant cases, petitioners were specifically sued in 
their personal capacities.</p>
<p class="BODY">For their part, the dismissed employees are entitled to damages 
because they have suffered a special and peculiar injury from the wrongful act 
of which they complain (<span class="SpellE">Mechem</span>, A Treatise on the Law 
of Public Offices and Officers, p. <span>391).<span>&nbsp; </span>It is an undeniable 
fact that the dismissed employees who were holding such positions as foremen, 
watchmen and drivers, suffered the uncertainties of the unemployed when they 
were plucked out of their positions.<span>&nbsp; </span>That not all of them 
testified as to the extent of damages they sustained on account of their 
separation from their government <span class="GramE">jobs,</span> cannot be used 
as a defense by the petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state that 
considering the positions they were holding, the dismissed employees concerned 
belong to a low-salaried group, who, if deprived of wages would generally incur 
considerable economic hardships.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Justice demands that they be recompensed for the predicament they 
were placed in, apart from the back salaries which they are entitled to as a 
matter of right.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are inclined to agree that the amount of 
P<span>1<span class="GramE">,<span>000.00</span></span></span> damages granted to 
each of them by the Court of Appeals was fixed by that court judiciously and is 
<span>a </span>reasonable sum (Article 2216, Civil Code).</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rama's</span> protestations that 
when he eventually became the governor of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, he reinstated most of the dismissed 
employees through provincial board Resolution No. 392 (L-44484 <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 16) cannot erase the fact that he had a 
hand in the adoption of Resolution No. 990.<span>&nbsp; </span>His subsequent 
benevolent act cannot sufficiently make up for the damage suffered by the 
dismissed employees during their period of unemployment.</p>
<p class="BODY"><em>Apropos </em>the practice of victorious politicians to remove 
government employees who did not support them in their campaign for office, this 
Court has said:<span>&nbsp; </span>"There are altogether too many cases of this 
nature, wherein local <span>elective officials, upon assumption to office, wield 
their </span>new-found power indiscriminately by replacing employees with their 
own <span class="SpellE">proteges</span> regardless of the laws and regulations 
governing the civil service.<span>&nbsp; </span>Victory at the polls should not be 
taken as authority for the commission of such illegal acts." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Nemenzo</em></span><em> vs. Sabillano</em>, 
L-20977, September 7, 1968, 25 SCRA 1).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in L-44894, the petition for review on 
<i>certiorari</i> is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
L-44484, L-44591 and L-44842, the decision of the First and Ninth Divisions of
