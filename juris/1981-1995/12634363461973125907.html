<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants anchored their defense on denial and alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yielding to the arrest of the police authorities,
accused-appellants now argue that they have been manhandled by the barangay
officials who forced them to admit the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>supported by the records and transcript
of stenographic notes are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">It was at dawn of July 29, 1991, specifically at 1:40 o'clock
when two taxi drivers namely Antonio Bautista and Rogelio Miranda were eating
merienda at a restaurant at the corner of Quezon Avenue and Speaker Perez
Streets, Quezon City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly, at about 6 to 7 meters away from the restaurant, a
Rocalex taxi stopped and someone from the inside of the taxi shouted three
times, "hold-up." Both Bautista and Miranda rushed to the taxi and
saw a commotion between the driver of the taxi and two other men, one sitting
beside the driver and the other seated at the back.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noticing Bautista and Miranda, the two men inside the taxi went
out and threatened the former with a fan knife.  Both witnesses described the two holduppers in detail, one being
taller than the other, the former holding a fan knife and was later identified
as accused-appellant Danilo Mercado.  The one seated at the back was shorter and was later identified as
accused-appellant Elmer de Asis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bautista and Miranda retreated for fear of their lives while the
two accused ran away towards Manila along Quezon Avenue and then turning right
at Apo Street, proceeded to Cuenco Street.  They were chased by Bautista and Miranda and other persons from within
the vicinity until they overtook one of the accused, namely, accused-appellant
Danilo Mercado whom they later turned over to Barangay Tanod Rodrigo
Austero.  A bloodied fan knife was
recovered from Mercado's right pocket by Tanod Austero.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Barangay Tanod Mariano Perez chased the other accused
and caught him at the corner of Kanlaon and Laong Laan Streets.  Frisked by Barangay Tanod Perez, a wallet
was recovered from the pocket of the accused, who answers to the name of Elmer
de Asis, containing the amount of P350.00 in cash and the driver's license of
the victim, Victor Peregrino together with the latter's picture.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found both accused guilty of the crime of Robbery
with Homicide, and sentenced them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered convicting both
accused ELMER DE ASIS <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">y </span>MENESES
and DANILO MERCADO y ADORABLE, beyond reasonable doubt as co-principals of
Robbery with Homicide charged in the information, as defined and penalized in
Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, and in accordance therewith, in
relation to Section 18, Bill of Rights, 1987 Constitution and Article 63 of the
Revised Penal Code, there being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances
which attended the commission of the offense, both of the said accused are each
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion perpetua</u>, with all the
accessory penalties provided by law, and to pay their proportionate costs
against each of them.  No award for
civil liability shall be made in this judgment in favor of the private
complainants, the heirs of Victor Peregrino, since they have reserved their
right to file a separate civil action for damages.  Both accused being detained and conformably with the practice in
the Quezon City Jail for all detention prisoners to agree in writing that they
be governed by the same rules pertaining to convicted prisoners, they are
credited with the full extent of their detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants raised the following errors committed by the
trial court:</p>

EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION ITSELF."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Each and every assigned error will be analyzed and answered
sequentially.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants contend that the trial court acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in not granting their
motion for preliminary investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit to this contention.  In fact accused-appellants are in estoppel from claiming lack of
preliminary investigation after they allowed themselves to be arraigned on
August 23, 1992 and pleaded "not guilty" to the charges without
invoking their right thereto thereby waiving the same.  Its absence does not go to the jurisdiction
of the court but merely to the regularity of the proceedings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It should be invoked prior to or at least, at the time of the plea.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the allegation that prosecution witnesses, Antonio Bautista
and Rogelio Miranda are "eleventh-hour witnesses," whose names do not
appear in the list of witnesses cited in the information, suffice it to say
that it is up for the prosecution to determine who should be presented as
witnesses on the basis of its own assessment of their necessity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find nothing irregular in their presentation as prosecution
witnesses.  Their non-inclusion in the
list of witnesses is of no moment.  In
fact the omission of their names in the list of prosecution witnesses in the
information is commonly practiced for their own protection at least until the
termination of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People vs. Mandapat</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x, there is nothing that could prevent the prosecution from
presenting witnesses in court not listed in the information, as it is well
settled that the court has the undisputed right to call on a witness whose name
does not appear in the list of the fiscal, unless the omission of said witness
is intentional and tainted with bad faith (People vs. Martinez, 127 SCRA 260
[1984]; People vs. Valera, 15 SCRA 164 [1965].  The established rule is that the prosecution may call unlisted witnesses
to testify (People vs. Lacson, 1 SCRA 414 [1961])<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the purpose of the listing of the names of the witnesses
in the complaint or information is merely to avoid the presentation of surprise
witnesses and to enable the defense to examine their record, morality and
character, but once placed on the witness stand, it can no longer be disputed
that the defense has already the opportunity to examine the character and
credibility of the unlisted witness (People vs. Morado, 4 SCRA 292 [1962].  Finally, it is beyond question that it is
the prosecution’s privilege to present such number of witnesses it deems
sufficient (People vs. Quebral, 134 SCRA 425 [1985].”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The third and fourth issues which concern the credibility of the
witnesses are interrelated and for convenience shall be discussed jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence teaches us that where the issue is one of
credibility of witnesses, appellate courts give due weight to the findings of
fact of the trial courts as they are in a better position to examine the
witnesses before them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>well as observe their demeanor and manner of testifying.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that no prosecution witness categorically
testified having seen appellants actually stab and rob the victim, the
confluence of events leading to the arrest of accused-appellants as testified
to by the prosecution witnesses leads to no other conclusion that they, and no
other, committed the crime imputed to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, prosecution witness Antonio Bautista, a taxi driver,
testified that while eating in a restaurant located at Speaker Perez St. and
Quezon Avenue, Quezon City, at around 1:40 A.M. of July 29, 1991, he heard
somebody shout, "hold-up, hold-up," from a taxi that suddenly stopped
about six (6) meters away.  He stood up
and saw two (2) persons immediately alight from the taxi and whom he identified
in court.  His testimony is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Clearly, from the
testimonies of taxi drivers Antonio Bautista, Rogelio Miranda and Barangay
Tanods Rodrigo Austero and Mariano Perez, the following facts were indubitably
established as contended by the Solicitor General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. That accused-appellants were seen immediately alighting from
the taxi driven by the victim after the latter parked at the middle of the road
shouting, "holdupper, holdupper."</p>

<p class="BODY">2. That the victim's wallet containing his driver's license was
recovered from accused-appellant Elmer de Asis after a long chase; while from
accused-appellant Danilo Mercado, a bloodstained knife, Exhibit "C",
was recovered immediately after the latter's arrest and apprehension.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. And the victim, Victor Peregrino, the driver of the Rocalex
Taxi, who was found bloodied inside his taxi <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>found to have sustained three (3) stab wounds and one (1)
incised wound resulting in cardio-respiratory arrest causing his death due to
shock and hemorrhage secondary to stab wounds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses could not have been mistaken in their
identification of the accused-appellants as the place where they were eating is
well lighted by a fluorescent lamp and by another one at the corner of Speaker
Perez and Quezon Avenue.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> It
has been held that where conditions of visibility are favorable and the witness
does not appear to be biased, assertions as to the identity of the malefactor
should normally be accepted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of the
prosecution witnesses which refer to minor details do not affect the
credibility of prosecution witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> On
the contrary, they bolster rather than emasculate a person's credibility, as
one cannot be expected to remember an incident with unerring accuracy in minute
detail.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants' explanation that they were on the way to the
Sta. Teresita Hospital where accused-appellant Mercado's mother works as a
security guard, in justification for their presence near the scene of the
incident is too flimsy and puerile to deserve serious consideration in the face
of their unexplained possession of the victim's wallet and a bloody knife right
after their arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, accused-appellants contend that the fact that
accused-appellant de Asis did not corroborate the story of Mercado that the
latter was mauled on their way to the Sta. Teresita Hospital should not have
been taken against the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, accused-appellants are unaware on how evidence are
weighed.  That conviction of an accused
is based on the strength of the prosecution's evidence and not on the weakness
of the defense, and that failure of an accused to take the witness stand cannot
be taken against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot but notice the solid and strong circumstantial evidence
pointing to the guilt of the accused-appellants.  There is more than one circumstance; the fact from which the
inferences are derived were proven; and the combination of all the
circumstances is such as to produce a conviction of guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not solely on the absence of the corroborating evidence of one of the
accused that conviction was based.  With
or without the corroborating testimony of accused-appellant Elmer de Asis,
still conviction will lie.</p>
