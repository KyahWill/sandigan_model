petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the decision of the respondent
Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) in AC-G.R. CV No. 58527,
dated <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="6">14 June 1983</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
affirming <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of the
lower court rendered in favor of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts that gave rise to this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner bought from <span style="">a
</span>certain Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> for the total sum
of P75,000.00 seven (7) foreign cinematographic films, as evidenced by four (4)
receipts of payment duly signed by said Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
who was allegedly the authorized agent and representative of private respon­dent
Intercontinental Film Distributors (P.I.) Corporation and <span style="">its </span>managing director, respondent
Roberto Suarez.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was stated in the said receipts that private respondents
Intercontinental Film Distributors (P.I.) Corporation (Intercontinental (P.I.),
for brevity) and Roberto <span style="">Suarez </span>agreed
that all the seven (7) films would be sent and delivered directly to petitioner
upon their arrival in the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the films were not delivered to petitioner despite repeated
demands, as <span style="">a </span>result of which,
the latter filed an action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> with damages
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch <span style="">XXII, </span>docketed as Civil Case No.
12578.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon petitioner’s filing of the necessary bond in the amount of
P150,000.00, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> issued a writ of seizure ordering
the Sheriff of Manila to take immediate possession of the seven (7) films.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six (6) films were seized by the Sheriff of
Manila from the Board of Censors, while the seventh film was seized by Special
Sheriff Gregorio Guido.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the seven
(7) cinematographic films had been delivered by Intercontinental (P.I.) to the
Board of Censors prior to their seizure.</p>

<p class="BODY">Informed of the seizure of the seven (7) films by the Sheriffs,
Intercontinental Film Distributors (H.K.) Ltd. (Intercontinental (H.K.), for
brevity) filed <span style="">a </span>third-party
claim, alleging ownership and asserting the right to possess the said seven (7)
cinematographic films, and stating in its claim that the value of the said
films was P250,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notified by the
Sheriff of the third-party claim, petitioner filed an <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion to quash the third-party claim and for
the delivery of <span style="">the </span>said films to
him (petitioner), instead of filing an indemnity bond as required by the
Sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion <span style="">was
</span>granted and the films were delivered <span style="">to </span>the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Intercontinental (H.K.) filed a motion praying the Court
that it be allowed to intervene in the case <span style="">as </span>party defendant, which motion was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did intervene as defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> and filed its answer to the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dismissed the complaint and set aside the writ of seizure it had issued
earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the lower court’s decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which respondent appellate court later affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Dismissing plaintiff’s complaint, and the writ of seizure issued
by t<span style="">his </span>Court in favor of the
plaintiff is hereby set aside;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Ordering plaintiff to return to defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> the seven (7) cinematographic films, namely,
Venus in Furs; Girl with Hungry Eyes; Free Love Confidential, Cool It Baby; <span class="SpellE">Mondo</span> Mod; Secret Sex Lives of Romeo and Juliet; Mantis <span style="">in Lace, in the same condition as they were
taken by and delivered to plaintiff on December 22, 1969 and </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the event that delivery cannot be made, plaintiff </span>shall pay <span style="">defendants and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
the sum of P250,000.00 representing the value of said seven (7) cinematographic

the aforesaid seven (7) cinematographic films are delivered </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">returned to defendants and defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>

<blockquote>With costs of suit against the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As already stated, the <span style="">C</span>ourt
of Appeals affirmed the <span style="">above </span>judgment
<span style="">in </span>its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied, petitioner <span style="">interposed </span>the present petition for
review, raising the following issues:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“(a) </span>Whether or not
the plaintiff has <span style="">a </span>valid cause
of action against the defendants and the defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>;</blockquote>

the authorized agent and representative of the defendant Intercontinental Film
Distributors <span style="">(P.I.) Corporation and its
Managing Director, defendant Roberto Suarez;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

commencing from December 23, 1969 until the aforesaid seven (7) cinematographic
films are delivered or returned to defendants and defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
or the sum of P250,000.00 is fully paid to defendants and defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>; and to pay further the amount of P10,000.00 by
way<span style=""> of attorney’s fees, are supported
by evidence and the law on the matter.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it would appear that the above-stated <span style="">issues </span>involve
a review mainly of factual findings of respondent appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have repeatedly held that in a petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> only legal questions should be raised before
this Court and that findings of fact of the Court of Ap<span style="">p</span>eals are conclusive on the parties and on this Court, absent
any showing of grave error or abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We note further that the issues raised and the arguments adduced
by petitioner in the present petition for review are reiterations of those
submitted by him to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first two (2) issues were resolved by the appellate court - to which
we agree - in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>“A study of the evidence <span class="SpellE">viz</span> a <span class="SpellE">viz</span> (sic) the arguments supporting the errors imputed to
the trial court in its decision appealed from convinces Us that the trial court
did not err in holding ‘the plaintiff-appellant as plainly has no cause of
action against defendants and defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>’
as it found that Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was not the duly
authorized agent or represen<span style="">tative of
the Intercontinental Film Distributors (PI) Corporation and Roberto Suarez, the
Managing Director, (who) denied having authorized Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
</span>to <span style="">enter into contract with the
plaintiff-appellant.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Let it be admitted that the cause of action of the
plaintiff-appellant in his complaint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> (to
take possession of the seven cinema­tographic films) is based on the alleged
sales of the films in question to plaintiff-appellant by defendants thru
Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> for the total <span style="">sum of P75,000 as evidenced by Exhibits ‘A’,
‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ and the alleged agency instituted by Roberto Suarez in favor
of Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> as shown by said Exhibits.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The trial court, however, found and We agree that
plaintiff-appellant failed to prove that Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
was the duly authorized agent or representative of the Intercontinental Films
Distributors (PI) Corporation and Roberto Suarez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the lower court went further stating
that <span style="">Exhibits ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ are
fictitious contracts, </span>a <span style="">forgery
undertaken merely to </span>promote <span style="">the
scheme of the plaintiff-appellant to take possession of the cinematographic
films in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the Intercontinental Films Distributors (H.K.) Ltd., <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
has established that it owns the said films. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the foregoing findings and conclusions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As private respondents correctly observed,
despite petitioner’s claim that he paid Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
the alleged agent of Roberto Suarez, the <span style="">sum
of </span>P75,000.00 as evidenced by the four (4) receipts of payment, and
despite the trial court’s suggestion that Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
be included as a defendant, petitioner failed to <span class="SpellE">implead</span>
said Norberto <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
presented as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> correctly resolved that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>. </span>The
failure of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span style="">to </span>testify and clear the doubt that surrounded the alleged <span style="">execution by Suarez of the receipt Exhibit E,
considerably weakened the claim of plaintiff that defendants and defendant-<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> sold to him the films in question for which <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> was duly authorized by defendant and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, and the proceeds of the sale was later turned
all<span style="">e</span>gedly over by <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> to Suarez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, the failure of petitioner to produce the person to whom
he allegedly paid P75,000.00 for the seven (7) films, rendered <span style="">his </span>claim untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, when a party has it in his possession or
power to produce the best evidence of which the case in its nature is
susceptible and withholds it, the fair presumption is that the evidence is
withheld for some sinister motive and that its production would thwart his evil
or fraudulent purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, we resolve the third issue raised by petitioner, in his
favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole basis for the award of damages against the petitioner is
the alleged unrealized profits of private respondents for the non-screening of
the seven (7) films.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>believe
that respondent court committed grave abuse of discretion in arriving at the
amount of <u><span style="">P10,000.00</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>a</u> <u><span style="">day</span></u><span style=""> </span>as unrealized
profits suffered by private respondents due to the filing of the present action
by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly averred
by petitioner, the films had yet to be passed by the Board of Censors and being
“bold” or so-called “<span class="SpellE">bomba</span>” films, there <span style="">was </span>the probability that some scenes
therein would have been cut or censored or the films totally banned, as in the
case of one of the films.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, no document or proof was presented to prove that private
respondents really lost such amount daily for non-exhibition of the films to
the public by reason of the action instituted by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of P10,000.00 a day as alleged
unrealized profit was arrived at by mere speculation and conjecture by
respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the award of
damages for the anticipated loss of profits is unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled rule that in order for damages to be recovered,
the best evidence obtainable by the injured party must be presented.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Actual or compensatory damages cannot <span style="">be
presumed, but must be duly proved, and proved with </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">reasonable degree of certainty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A court cannot rely on speculation, conjecture or guesswork as to the
fact and amount of damages, but must depend upon competent proof that they have
been suffered and on evidence of the actual amount thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the proof is flimsy and unsubstantial, no
damages will be awarded.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED with
the modification that the award of damages in the <span style="">amount of P10,000.00 a day for alleged unrealized profits is
eliminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
