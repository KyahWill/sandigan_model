<p class="BODY">Plaintiff planted bananas, bancocan, coffee, coconuts,
breadfruits, abaca and some auxiliary <span style="">crops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also looked after the coffee and abaca
plants of defendant, as well as the latter's goats entrusted to his care.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For clearing the coconut plantation, he was

his labor in making copra, he was paid 1/3 of the copra he made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other persons who made copra therein were
also correspondingly paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On January 30, 1964,
defendant wrote plaintiff telling him not to "interfere with the
plants" as they had no agreement yet for that year, and that being the
landowner, he should be the one to decide in accordance with the "tenancy
law"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
March 4, 1964, defendant sent another letter to plaintiff prohibiting him from
planting and clearing the land for the same reason</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff sought the assistance of the Office of the Agrarian Counsel in
Naga City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efforts to settle the case
amicably failed, as a consequence of which, plaintiff brought an action against
defendant in the Court of Agrarian Relations of Naga City praying that
defendant be </span>held guilty of illegal ejectment; that in view of the
strained relationship with defendant, <span style="">he
was waiving his </span><span style="">right to
reinstatement provided he be paid reasonable compensation for his improvements;
and that defendant be ordered to pay him actual and moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case was heard by
Judge Valeriano A. del Valle, then by Judge Agustin Frivaldo, and terminated by
Commissioner Benjamin G. Fernandez, who was appointed by the Court to hear the
case on January 20, 1966, with the consent of the parties</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Based on the Commis­sioner's Report, which was adopted </span><i><span style="">in toto</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">by the Court, a
judgment was rendered on May 17, 1966 dismissing the suit for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff moved for reconsi­deration,
but this was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its judgment,
the Court </span><i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">specifically
made a finding that plaintiff had expressly waived his right to reinstatement
"on account of his strained relationship with defendant."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals, which Court, however,
as hereinabove stated, certified the case to us on the theory that "where
the issue is the construction or interpretation of contracts, or where all the
facts are stated in the judgment and the issue <span style="">is the conclusion drawn therefrom, the question is one of law
reviewable by the Supreme Court".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff has assigned
the following errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"The lower Court erred in hold­ing that appellant is merely an
over­seer of appellee over the landholding in question.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>The Court a quo committed a grave error in considering exhibits
'2', 'C', &amp; 'C-1' as contracts that established merely an overseer re­lationship
between the appellant and appellee; in this regard the Court a quo deviated
from the es­tablished procedures in determining the nature of a contract.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>The Court a quo committed a grave error in authorizing the
ejectment of appellant.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>The Court failed to observe the requirements of Sections 10 &amp;
11, Rule 33 of the New Rules of Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole issue for
determination is whether under the parties' agreements, plaintiff was
instituted as an overseer or as a tenant by defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, a few basic principles on the interpretation of
contracts should be reiterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
there is no doubt as to the intention of the contracting parties, its literal
meaning shall control.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Article 1372 of the New Civil Code further provides that however general the
terms of a contract may be, they shall not be understood to comprehend things
that are distinct and cases that <span style="">are
different from those upon which the parties in­tended to agree</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, a meaning other than that expressed or an interpretation
which would alter its strict and literal significance should not be given to
it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, the entirety of the contract must be
taken into consideration to ascertain the meaning of its provisions</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear from Exhibit
C that plaintiff was made an overseer of defendant, not a tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was likewise expressly stipulated therein
that "the con­ditions for clearing the land are these:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to all your plants we will share
no percentage for the land." And again, "all those (coconuts) that we
are to plant no share will be taken for the land"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The basic element of sharing in agricultural
tenancy, therefore, is absent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
one-third share plaintiff received from copra-making constituted payments for
the processing of copra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are
evidenced by re­ceipts</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff also got paid for clearing the coconuts as shown by Exhibits 7
and 7-A</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A tenant is defined under section 5(a) of Republic Act No. 1199
as a person who, himself, and with the aid available from within his immediate
household, culti­vates the land belonging to or possessed by another, with the
latter's consent for purposes of production, sharing the produce with the
landholder under the share tenancy system, or paying to the landholder a price
certain or ascertainable in produce or in money or both, under the leasehold
tenancy system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the above
definition of a tenant, it is clear that absent a sharing arrangement, no
tenancy relationship had ever existed between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What transpired was that plaintiff was made
overseer over a 7-hectare land <span style="">area; </span>he
was to supervise applications for loans from those residing therein; he was
allowed to build his house thereon and to plant specified plants without being <span style="">compensated; he was free to clear and plant
the land as long as he wished; he had no sharing arrangement between him and
defendant; and he was not obligated to pay any price certain to, nor share the
produce with, the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although Exhibit 6 states that plaintiff and his wife were made
"caretakers" of the land, there is a definite provision in both
Exhibits C and 6 that de­fendant would not share in the produce of plaintiff's
plants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this aspect, the
ruling in Latag vs. Banog, 16 SCRA 88 (1966), which holds that a
"caretaker of an agricultural land is also considered cultivator of the
land", finds no applicability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even if we were to rule that plaintiff is a tenant, the
whole exercise would become academic since he has waived his right to
reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the fourth assignment of error, plaintiff
asserts, for the first time, that the trial Court committed grave error in
failing to notify the parties of the filing of the Commissioner's Report, and
in not giving them ten days to object thereto pursuant to Section 10, Rule 33
of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claims
that the Court failed to set the Report for hearing in accordance with Section
11 of the same Rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may,
well established is the rule that issues not raised in the trial Court can not
be raised for the first time on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
Petition is hereby dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
