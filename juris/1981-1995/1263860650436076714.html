Labor Relations Commission First Division in Case No. NCR-8-3566-83, which
reversed the Order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1984</st1:date>
of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> S. Hernandez directing
the reinstatement of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> de Leon by
private respondent La <span class="SpellE">Tondena</span>, Inc. with payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and other benefits due a regular employee; and,
(2) the Resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="3">March 21,
 1985</st1:date> denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that petitioner was employed by private respondent La <span class="SpellE">Tondena</span>, Inc. on <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="12">December
 11, 1981</st1:date>, at the Maintenance Section of its Engineering Department
in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

His work consisted mainly of painting company building and equipment, and other
odd jobs relating to maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
paid on a daily basis through petty cash vouchers.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early part of January, 1983, after a service of more than
one (1) year, petitioner requested from respondent company that he be included
in the payroll of regular workers, instead of being paid through petty cash
vouchers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent's response
to this request was to dismiss petitioner from his employment on <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been refused reinstatement despite
repeated demands, petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal,
reinstatement and payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> before the
Office of the Labor Arbiter of the then Ministry now Department of Labor and
Employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that he was dismissed following his request to
be treated as a regular employee; that his work consisted of painting company
buildings and maintenance chores like cleaning and operating company equipment,
assisting <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanque</span>,
Jr., a regular maintenance man; and that weeks after his dismissal, he was
re-hired by the respondent company indirectly through the Vitas-<span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Village Livelihood Council, a labor agency of
respondent company, and was made to perform the tasks which he used to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanque</span>, Jr. corroborated these averments of petitioner in
his affidavit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent claimed that petitioner was
not a regular employee but only a casual worker hired allegedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only </span>to paint a certain building in
the company premises, and that his work as a painter terminated upon the
completion of the painting job.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1984</st1:date>,
Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> S. Hernandez rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:

finding the complaint meritorious and the dismissal illegal; and ordering the
respondent company to reinstate petitioner with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and other benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Labor Arbiter Hernandez
ruled that petitioner was not a mere casual employee as asserted by private
respondent but a regular employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
concluded that the dismissal of petitioner from the service was prompted by his
request to be included in the list of regular employees and to be paid through
the payroll and is, therefore, an attempt to circumvent the legal obligations
of an employer towards a regular employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Labor Arbiter Hernandez found as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"After<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>a thorough
examination of the records of the case and evaluation of the evidence and
versions of the parties, this Office finds and so holds that the dismissal of
complainant is illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
impressive attempt of respondents to show that the complainant was hired as
casual and for the work on particular project, that is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the repainting of Mama Rosa Building, which particular work of painting
and repainting is not pursuant to the regular business of the company,
according to its theory, we find differently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant's being hired on casual basis did not dissuade from the </span>cold
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">fact that such painting of the building
and the painting and repainting of the equipment and tools and other things
belonging to the company and the odd jobs assigned to him to be performed when
he had no painting and repainting works related to maintenance as a maintenance
man are necessary and desirable to the better operation of the business
company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent did not even attempt
to deny and </span>refute the corroborating statements of <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tangue</span>, Jr., who was regularly employed by it as a
maintenance man doing the same jobs not only of painting and repainting of
building, equipment and tools and machineries or machines of the company but
also other odd jobs in the Engineering and Maintenance Department that
complainant <span class="SpellE">Moises</span> de Leon did perform the same odd
jobs and assignments as were assigned to him during the period de Leon was
employed for more than one year continuously by said respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason not to give credit and weight
to the affidavit and statement made therein by <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tanque</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This strongly confirms that complainant did the work pertaining to the
regular business in which the company had been organized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent cannot be permitted to circumvent
the law on security of tenure by considering complainant as a casual worker on
daily rate basis and after working for a period that has entitled him to be
regularized that he would be automatically terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, however, the above decision of the Labor Arbiter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>reversed
by the First Division of the National Labor Relations Commission by virtue of
the votes of two members<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which constituted a majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Commissioner Geronimo Q. Quadra dissented, voting "for the
affirmation of the well-reasoned decision of the Labor Arbiter below."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion for reconsideration was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this recourse. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner asserts that the respondent Commission erred and
gravely abused its discretion in reversing the Order of the Labor Arbiter in
view of the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> fact that the tasks he
performed included not only painting but also other maintenance work which are
usually necessary or desirable in the usual business of private respondent;
hence, the reversal violates the Constitutional and statutory provisions for
the protection of labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, as expected, maintains the opposite view
and argues that petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>hired
only as a painter to repaint specifically the Mama Rosa building at its <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> compound, which painting work is not part of their
main business; that at the time of his engagement, it was made clear to him
that he would be so engaged on <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>casual
basis, so much so that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>not
required to accomplish an application form or to comply with the usual
requisites for employment; and that in fact, petitioner was never paid his
salary through the regular payroll but always through petty cash vouchers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, in his Comment, recommends that the
petition be given due course in view of the evidence on record supporting
petitioner's contention that his work was regular in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his view, the dismissal of petitioner
after he demanded to be regularized was a subterfuge to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">circumvent </span>the law on regular employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further recommends that the questioned
decision and resolution of respondent Commission be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">annulled </span>and the Order of the Labor Arbiter directing the
reinstatement of petitioner with payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and other benefits be upheld.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
</span>records of this case, the Court finds merit in the petition as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We </span>sustain the position of the
Solicitor General <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">that </span>the
reversal of the decision of the Labor Arbiter by the respondent Commission was
erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law on the matter is Article 281 of the Labor Code which
defines regular and casual employment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 281.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Regular and
casual employment - The provisions of a written agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreements of the parties, an
employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to
perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual
business <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">or </span>trade of the
employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or
undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the
time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or services to be
performed is seasonal in nature and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">employment
</span>is for the duration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not
covered by the preceding paragraph:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Provided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That any employee who
has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous
or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity
in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such actually
exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision reinforces the Constitutional mandate to protect
the interest of labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its language
evidently manifests the intent to safeguard the <span class="SpellE">tenurial</span>
interest of the worker who may be denied the rights and benefits due a regular
employee by virtue of lopsided agreements with the economically powerful
employer who can maneuver to keep an employee on a casual status for as long as
convenient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Thus, </span>contrary agreements notwithstanding, an employment is
deemed regular when the activities performed by the employee are usually
necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not considered regular are the so-called
"project employment" the completion or termination of which is more or
less determinable at the time of employment, such as those employed in
connection with a particular construction project,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and seasonal employment which by its nature is only desirable for a limited
period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any </span>employee who has rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">at </span>least one year of service, whether
continuous or intermittent, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>deemed
regular with respect to the activity he performed and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">while </span>such activity actually exists.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primary standard, therefore, of determining a regular
employment is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed
by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The test <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>whether the former is usually
necessary or desirable in the usual business <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">or trade </span>of the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The connection can be determined by considering the nature of the work
performed and its relation to the scheme of the particular business or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">trade in </span>its entirety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, if the employee has been performing the
job for at least one year, even if the performance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">is </span>not continuous or merely intermittent, the law deems the
repeated and continuing need for its performance as sufficient evidence of the
necessity if not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">indispensability of
that activity to the business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the employment is also considered re</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">g</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ular, but only with
respect to such activity and while such activity <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">exists.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, the
respondent company, which is engaged in the business of manufacture and
distillery of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">wines </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and liquors, claims that petitioner was
contracted on a casual basis specifically to paint a certain company building
and that its com</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">letion rendered petitioner's </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">emp</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">lo</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

was exclusively limited to painting that certain building, respondent company's
theory of casual employment would have been worthy of consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">However, during
petitioner's period of employment, the records reveal that the tasks assigned

job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A regular employee of respondent
company, <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanque</span>,
Jr., attested in his affidavit that petitioner worked with him as a maintenance
man when there was no painting job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is noteworthy that, as
wisely observed by the Labor Arbiter, the respondent company did not even
attempt to ne</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">g</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ate the above averments of petitioner and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>co-employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the respondent company did not only
fail to dispute this vital point, it even went further and confirmed its
veracity when it expressly admitted in its comment that, "The main bulk of
work and/or activities </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assigned </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to petitioner was painting and other related
activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Occasionally, he was
instructed to do other </span>odd things in connection with maintenance while
he was waiting for materials he would need in his job or when he had finished
early one assigned to him."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Commission, in reversing the finding of the Labor
Arbiter reasoned that petitioner's job cannot be considered as necessary or
desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer because,
"Painting the business or factory building is not a part of the
respondent's manufacturing or distilling process of wines and liquors.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fallacy of the reasoning is readily apparent in view of the
admitted fact that petitioner's activities included not only painting but other
maintenance work as well, a fact which even the respondent Commission, like the
private respondent, also expressly recognized when it stated in its decision
that, "Although complainant's (petitioner) work was mainly painting, he
was occasionally asked to do other odd jobs in connection with maintenance
work."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It misleadingly assumed that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">all </span>the
petitioner did during his more than one year of employment was to paint a
certain building of the respondent company, whereas it is admitted that he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">given </span>other assignments relating to
maintenance work besides painting company building and equipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is self-serving, to say the least, to isolate petitioner's
painting job to justify the proposition of casual employment and conveniently
disregard the other maintenance activities of petitioner which were assigned by
the respondent company when he was not painting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law demands that the nature and entirety
of the activities performed by the employee be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of petitioner, the painting and
maintenance work given him manifest a treatment consistent with a maintenance
man <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not </span>just a painter, for if his job was truly only to paint a
building there would have been no basis for giving him other work assignments <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>between painting activities.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not tenable to argue that the painting and maintenance work
of petitioner are not necessary in respondent's business of manufacturing
liquors and wines, just as it cannot be said that only those who are directly
involved in the process of producing wines and liquors may be considered as
necessary employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, there
would have been no need for the regular Maintenance Section of respondent
company's Engineering Department, manned by regular employees like <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanque</span>, Jr., whom
petitioner often worked with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the petitioner performed his work of painting and
maintenance activities during his employment in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">respondent's </span>business which lasted for more than one year, until
early January, 1983 when he demanded to be regularized and was subsequently
dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, by this fact alone
he is entitled by law to be considered a regular employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And considering further that weeks after his
dismissal, petitioner was rehired by the company through a labor agency and was
returned to his post in the Maintenance Section and made to perform the same
activities that he used to do, it cannot be denied that his activities as a
regular painter and maintenance man still exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is of no moment that petitioner was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">told </span>when he was hired that his employment would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">only </span>be casual, that he was paid
through cash vouchers, and that he did not comply with regular employment
procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the law overrides
such conditions which are prejudicial to the interest of the worker whose weak
bargaining position needs the support of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What determines whether a certain employment
is regular or casual is not the will and word of the employer, to which the
desperate worker often accedes, much less the procedure of hiring the employee
or the manner of paying his salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is the nature of the activities performed in relation to the particular
business or trade considering all circumstances, and in some cases the length
of time of its performance and its continued existence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, considering its task to give life and spirit to the
Constitutional mandate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the
protection of labor, to enforce and uphold our labor laws which must be
interpreted liberally in favor of the worker in case of doubt, the Court cannot
understand the failure of the respondent Commission to perceive the obvious
attempt on the part of the respondent company to evade its obligations to
petitioner by dismissing the latter days after he asked to be treated as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">regular </span>worker on the flimsy pretext
that his painting work was suddenly finished only to rehire him indirectly

lack of jurisdiction.</p>
