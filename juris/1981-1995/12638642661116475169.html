				<H3>VIRGINIA JORGE AND ANITA VERGARA, PETITIONERS, VS.
HON. FRANCISCO Z. CONSOLACION (PRESIDING JUDGE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE BRANCH II,
DAVAO CITY) EMILIO MATULAC, HIS AGENTS AND
REPRESENTATIVES, AND THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF
DAVAO CITY, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was originally a litigation between two (2) sisters, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Nieves, both surnamed Palma Gil, involving a
piece of land covered by TCT No. T-432 with a total area of 829 square
meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 1160 was filed by
<span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> against Nieves and her husband Angel <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> for specific performance based on an actionable
document seeking, among other things to compel Nieves to cede to the former
256.20 square meters of the subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court rendered a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1954</st1:date> in favor
of the plaintiff and against defendants ordering the latter to comply with the
terms of the document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said decision was
appealed to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the assailed decision prompting
the winning party to move for the execution of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, because the Provincial Sheriff in executing the decision
carved out a specific portion of the land covered by TCT No. 432 containing an
area of 256.20 square meters notwithstanding the pronouncement in the decision
rendered in Civil Case No. 1160 that the subject lot is an undivided portion of
the entire property covered by the title, the defendants brought the matter to
Us questioning the actuations of the Sheriff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> sold on October
24, 1956 portions of the subject property identified by the lower court as Lots
No. 59-C-1 and 59-C-2 to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, defendant Nieves also mortgaged and sold a portion, known as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
59-C-4 to the Prudential Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, in Our Resolution, <u>dated</u> <st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8"><u>August</u> <u>31,</u> <u>1961</u></st1:date>
the actuation of the Sheriff was nullified and the case was remanded to the
court of origin for further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span>, the Court of First Instance issued an order, dated
<st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12"><u>December</u> <u>7,</u> <u>1961</u></st1:date>,
allowing her to be substituted for <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Palma
Gil who died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the case was remanded to the Court of First Instance for
further proceedings, said court made finding of facts that the defendants
mortgaged and sold a portion of the subject property of Lot No. 59-C-4, which
lot was then segregated and allotted to her by virtue of the partition made by
the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, which partition was
questioned by the defendants before the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, the lower court (CFI) ruled
in its Order dated <u>February</u> <u>17,</u> <u>1964</u> that the defendants
had waived the benefits of the decision of the Supreme Court rendered on August
31, 1961, and that the conveyance of Lots Nos. 59-C-1 to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> and 59-C-2 must stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1966</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> sold the
Lots 59-C-1 and 59-C-2 to a certain <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
was confirmed by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in another related case, G.R. No.
52013.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="5">May 10,
 1977</st1:date>, petitioners herein entered into a Lease Agreement over a
portion of the land covered by TCT No. T-432 consisting of 218 square meters
with Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Maglana</span> sold Lots 59-C-1 and 59-C-2 to Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
is now the private respondent in the petition before <span class="GramE">Us</span>,
while petitioners are the parties of the first part who entered into the
aforementioned Memorandum Agreement with the defendant Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two orders of the Court of First Instance, dated <st1:date year="1961" day="7" month="12"><u>December</u> <u>7,</u> <u>1961</u></st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1964" day="17" month="2"><u>February</u> <u>17,</u> <u>1964</u></st1:date>
were questioned by defendants<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
by filing their Motion for Reconsideration which was denied by the Court of
First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants brought the
question to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on <i>certiorari</i> which was
dismissed by Us on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of the finality of the orders, <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> filed a motion
for execution of the decision of the court of origin dated <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1954</st1:date>, which was granted by said court in
its Order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1977</st1:date>,
defendants filed a motion to set aside the order of <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date>, which the Court of First
Instance denied in its order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1977</st1:date>, defendants filed
their Motion for Reconsideration of the orders dated <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the Court of First Instance denied said Motion for Reconsideration,
in its order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1977</st1:date>,
the defendants brought the matter to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, said court affirmed the questioned
orders prompting again defendants to elevate the same to <span class="GramE">Us</span>
on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Our resolution,
dated <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1982</st1:date>, in
G.R. No. 56399 <span class="GramE">We</span> affirmed the ruling of the appellate
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In effect, therefore, the
decision of the trial court dated <st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="4">April
 7, 1954</st1:date>, in Civil Case No. 1160 has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> to be executed by virtue of the order dated <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1977</st1:date> which granted a writ
of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of <span class="GramE">Our</span> <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the assailed orders and acting upon motion of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span>,
respondent Judge Francisco Z. <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> issued the
Writ of Demolition dated <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="4">April 30,
 1982</st1:date> and Special Order of Demolition dated <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1982</st1:date> for the removal of petitioners'
building and/or structures found therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now question before Us the authority of the
respondent Judge in including in its writ of execution an order to eject herein
petitioners and to demolish their house and structure contending that
petitioners and private respondents were not parties to the original case and
that a separate and independent action to eject petitioners and to demolish
their house and structure should have been resorted to by respondent Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span> who as alleged by petitioners were not properly
substituted as one of the indispensable parties of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argued further that the order of the
trial court dated April 7, 1954 in Civil Case No. 1160 which was affirmed by Us
mentioned nothing about <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the petitioners
or anyone who may be found occupying said lot in question nor the demolition of
any house or structure found thereat.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claimed that the judgment in Civil Case No. 1160 was
limited in ordering the defendant Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>:</p>

<blockquote>“a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To execute the necessary documents <span class="SpellE">transfering</span> in favor of the plaintiff 256 square meters
with 20 meters of Lot No. 59-C;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To construct the building on the land in
question; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To execute the necessary documents ceding in
favor of the plaintiff the usufruct of the rent equivalent to one-half (1/2) of
the building constructed."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' contentions do not hold water.</p>

<p class="BODY">When We dismissed on September 16, 1974, the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
filed by defendants questioning the orders, dated December 7, 1961 and December
17, 1964, in effect We had confirmed the sale by plaintiff in Civil Case No.
1160, <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Palma Gil, of Lot 59-C-1 and Lot
59-C-2 to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span>
and affirmed the ruling of the trial court that defendants had waived the
benefit of Our Resolution rendered on August 31, 1961.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when defendant Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> entered into a Lease Agreement with the
petitioners herein on May 10, 1977 over the subject lots, the former was no
longer in a capacity as owner to enter into such an agreement in order to bind
the subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, such
contract cannot be binding on <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> adjudged as owner of the land in question by the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as gathered from the
background facts and the previous related orders and resolutions of the trial
court which were sustained by Us in Our aforementioned Orders and resolutions,
the intent or the gist of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
the initial judgment in Civil Case No. 1160 was necessarily and substantially
altered when We ordered in Our resolution dated January 13, 1982, the immediate
implementation of the lower court's order of execution dated August 19, 1977,
aptly observing that this case has dragged on for twenty-nine (29) years
because of the numerous motions filed by defendants which delayed the execution
of the judgment in Civil Case No. 1160.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, be it remembered that after the issuance of said
order of execution petitioners herein without being a necessary party in Civil
Case No. 1160, filed with the respondent Judge, "An Urgent Motion to Hold
in Abeyance the Writ of Execution" (Annexes "A" pp. 100-101, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By merely
claiming to be the owners of the building sought to be demolished despite the
fact that they were merely lessees of the losing party, petitioners cause the
continuous stay of the defendant Nieves for a few more months in the land
subject of the aforesaid case and was able to collect continuously the amount
of P600.00 from the petitioners as the <span class="SpellE">latters</span>’
monthly rental of the land to the prejudice of the herein plaintiff's
successors-in-interest, respondent Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span>,
who appears to be the present registered owner of the land wherein the building
sought to be demolished had been constructed, as evidenced by TCT No. T-80631
of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City dated <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, dated
March 3, 1982, (Annex "C") of the order of respondent Judge denying
their Motion to Hold in Abeyance the Writ of Execution, shows that the
petitioners pray that no demolition of the building and/or improvements found
in the land subject of the execution shall take place, unless a <u>special</u> <u>order</u>
<u>of</u> <u>demolition</u> shall take place on grounds of equity and justice,
notwithstanding the finality of the judgment rendered by the trial court
against the defendant in Civil Case No. 1160.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To counteract this move of petitioners, plaintiffs' successor-in­-interest
who is now private respondent Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1982</st1:date> filed a Motion for Issuance
of Special Order of Writ of Demolition, quoted as follows:</p>

of the decision, this Court finds the same to be of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> brought the
subject land from the late <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Palma Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the transfer of interest to her, <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span> was thus subrogated
to the rights and obligations of the late <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Palma Gil with respect to the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
would be the one benefited or injured by the judgment or become entitled to the
avails of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacedes</span> has been
properly substituted to the deceased plaintiff upon her motion and with the
approval of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is,
therefore, a real party-in­-interest.'</p>

land in question from <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>,
who bought it from <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span>,
is subrogated to the rights, interests and obligations of the latter, and
therefore, is a real party in interest, and has personality to ask for the
execution of the decision in this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second and third grounds of <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
are not well-taken, because the record shows, that the motions for execution,
possession and special order of demolition were all served on Atty. Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>, counsel for the defendants, through FAR
Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the 4th ground of <span class="SpellE">movants</span>,
that the special order of demolition is improper against them for they are not
parties to the case, this Court finds no merit in the same because <span class="SpellE">movants</span> Virginia Jorge and Anita <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
are actually in possession of the land in question now without authority, and
so the special order to demolish their building and/or structures thereof is
properly applicable to them.</blockquote>

personality to intervene in this case, they being not parties to the case.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="5">May 27,
 1982</st1:date>, a "Writ of Demolition (Annex "G" for
Respondents, pp. 128, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), was issued by the
respondent Judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been shown
therein that all the legal requirements as provided for under Sec. 10 and Sec.
14 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court for the issuance of the writ of demolition
had been strictly complied with before the demolition of the structures and that
possession by the private respondent had been finally carried out and/or
enforced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Secs</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> 10 and 14 of Rule 39
read as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 10.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- If a judgment directs a party to execute a
conveyance of land or deliver deeds or other documents, or to perform any other
specific act, and then fails to comply within the time specified the court may
direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other
person appointed by the court and the act so done shall have like effect as if
done by the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If real or personal
property is within the Philippines, the court in lieu of directing conveyance
thereof may enter judgment divesting the title of any party and vesting it in
others and such judgment shall have the force and effect of conveyance executed
in due form of law."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 14.</span> - When the property
subject of the execution contains improvements constructed or planted by the
judgment debtor or his agent, the officer shall not destroy, demolish or remove
said improvements except upon special order of the court issued upon petition
of the judgment creditor after due hearing and after the former has failed to
remove the same within a reasonable time fixed by the court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It appears from the record that the said
buildings and/or structures were actually demolished last June 14, 1982, and
the land hereof is now in the possession of the private respondent Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span> as per "Delivery Receipt" dated <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1986</st1:date> (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court in its finding that respondent
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Matulac</span> had every right to ask for the writ of
execution, since having bought the land in question from <span class="SpellE">Constancio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>, who bought the land from <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pacetes</span>, he was subrogated to the rights, interests
and obligations of the latter and therefore, is a real party in interest as
against the alleged rights of petitioners who were in possession of the land in
question as lessees by virtue of a Contract or Agreement of Lease with Nieves
Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> who was declared not the owner of
the land in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is established
therefore that petitioners were in possession of the land in question without
the legal right to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence the
special order to demolish their building and/or structures therein was properly
applicable to them, as they had no authority from the registered owner, who has
every right as an act of ownership to request the court for a special order of
Demolition of any existing structure found within his property.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noted that during the rendition of the judgment in Civil Case
No. 1160, the parties were not yet awarded their respective shares in the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there was yet
no partition of the property and the parties were merely entitled to <u>pro-<span class="SpellE">indiviso</span></u> shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the circumstances, no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> order could
be directed to the defendant (Nieves Palma Gil) or to any of the co-owners of
the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
the power of the court to issue the order of execution cannot be limited to
what is stated in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
trial court's judgment in Civil Case No. 1160, in view of the continued failure
of Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> or the defendant in
said case, to comply with what was required of her in said judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Nieves Palma Gil <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>
was in possession of the property illegally for several years, depriving the
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and her successors-in-interest
of their legal right to possess the lot in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, as mere lessees of the
losing party, have no rights whatsoever to claim and to be protected by the
mantle of the law and neither do they have the right to intervene and/or block
the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. 1160.</p>
