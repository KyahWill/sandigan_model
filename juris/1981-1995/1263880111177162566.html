<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner submits the
following issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1. Whether or
not the respondent Court of Appeals can validly pierce the fiction of corporate
identity of the defendant corporation Inland Industries, Inc. even if there is
no allegation in the complaint regarding the same, nor is there anything in the
prayer demanding the piercing of the <span style="">corporate
veil of the corporation Inland Industries, Inc.;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether</span> or not the Court of Appeals
can validly pierce the fiction of corporate identity of the defendant Inland
Industries, Inc. even if absolutely no proof was presented in court to serve as
legal justification for the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find this petition to
be bereft of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issues are
basically factual and a careful scrutiny of the decisions of both courts below
reveals that their findings and conclusions on the matter of piercing the veil
of corporate fiction and on the liability of herein petitioner are
overwhelmingly supported by the evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Insofar as material and
relevant to the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span>, the trial court found
and held:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As to [the] liability of [the] defendant Roberto A. Jacinto,
it would appear that he is in factetum (sic), or, in fact, the corporation
itself known as Inland Industries, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aside from the fact that he is admittedly the President and General
Manager of the corporation and <span class="GramE">a substantial stockholders</span>
(sic) thereof, it was defendant Roberto A. Jacinto who dealt entirely with the
plaintiff in those transactions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
Trust Receipts that he signed supposedly in behalf of Inland Industries, Inc.,
it is not even mentioned that he did so in this official capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this case, the Court is satisfied that Roberto A. Jacinto was
practically the corporation itself, the Inland Industries, Inc."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In a detailed fashion, the
respondent Court of Appeals brushed aside the posturings of petitioner as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Defendant Roberto Jacinto, tried to escape liability and
shift the entire blame under the trust receipts solely and exclusively on
defendant-appellant <span class="GramE">corporation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserted that he cannot be held solidarily
liable with the latter (defendant corporation) because he just signed said
instruments in his official capacity as president of Inland Industries, Inc.
and the latter (defendant corporation) has a juridical personality distinct and
separate from its <span style="">officers and
stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise asserted,
citing an American case, that the principle of piercing the fiction of
corporate entity should be applied with great caution and not precipitately,
because a dual personality </span>by <span style="">a
corporation and its stockholders would defeat the principal purpose for which a
corporation is formed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Upon </span><span style="">the other hand, plaintiff-appellee reiterated its allegation in the
complaint that <span class="GramE">defendant corporation</span> is just a mere
alter ego of defendant Roberto Jacinto who </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">its President and
General Manager, while the wife of the latter owns a majority of its shares of
stock.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants-appellants' assertion is plainly without legal
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is shown by the undisputed
fact that Roberto Jacinto even admitted that he and his wife own 52% of the
stocks of <span class="GramE">defendant corporation</span> (TSN, April 22, 1985,
p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot accept as true the
assertion of defendant Jacinto that he only acted in his official capacity as
President and General Manager of Inland Industries, Inc. when he signed the
aforesaid trust receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Our mind
the same is just a clever ruse and a convenient ploy to thwart his personal
liability therefor by taking refuge under the protective mantle of the separate
corporate personality of <span class="GramE">defendant corporation</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As could be expected, Roberto Jacinto in his direct testimony
presented a different corporate scenario regarding Inland Industries, Inc. and
vehemently declared that it is Bienvenida Catabas who is its President, while
Aurora Heresa is its Chairman of the Board.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His assertion on this point, however, is not convincing in view of his
admission in the same breath, that his wife, Hedy U. Jacinto, own (sic) with
him 52% of the shares of stock of said corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this circumstance - even if standing
alone - cannot but engender in the most unprejudiced mind doubt and misgiving
why Catabas and Heresa would be defendant corporation's President and Chairman
of the Board, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent
portion of his testimony on this point is quoted hereunder:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Atty. Carlos<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you know the defendant Inland
Industries, Inc.?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Because I am the General Manager of this corporation.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aside from being the General Manager of the
defendant corporation are you in any other way connected with the same?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am also a stockholder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does your corpora­tion have a Board of
Directors?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the way, who are the stockholders of
this corporation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bienvenida Catabas, Aurora Heresa, Paz
Yulo, Hedy Y. Jacinto and myself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who is the Presi­dent of the defend­ant
corporation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bienvenida Catabas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who is the Chairman of the Board?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aurora Heresa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you have any relation with Hedy Y.
Jacinto?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She is my wife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you combine the stockholdings of your
wife together with yours and percentage wise, how much is your equity?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Atty. Dizon raised some objections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the Court allowed the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About 52%.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Ibid.,
pp. 3-6)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, a cursory perusal of the Stipulation of facts clearly
shows that defendant Roberto Jacinto acted in his capacity as President and
General Manager of Inland Industries, Inc. when he signed said trust
receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pertinent portion of his
testimony are quoted below:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1.2in; text-indent: -0.3in;">`(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the goods covered by the three (3) Letters
of Credit (Annexes "A", "B" &amp; "C") and paid
for under the Bills of Exchange (Annexes "D", "E" &amp;
"F") were delivered to and received by defendant Inland Industries,
Inc. <span style="">through its co-defendant Roberto
A. Jacinto, its President and General Manager, who signed for and in behalf of
defendant Inland and agreed to the terms and conditions of three (3) separate
trust receipts covering the same and herein identified as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>x x <span style="">x.' (p. 3 of Stipulations of Facts and Formulation of Issues (p. 95,
Records)).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The conflicting statements by defendant Jacinto place in extreme
doubt his credibility anent his alleged participation in said transactions and <span class="GramE">We</span> are thus persuaded to agree with the findings of the
lower court <span style="">that the latter (Roberto
Jacinto) was practically the corporation itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, a painstaking examination of the
records show that there is no clear-cut delimitation between the personality of
Roberto Jacinto as an individual and the personality of Inland Industries, Inc.
as a corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The circumstances aforestated lead <span class="GramE">Us</span> to
conclude that the corporate veil that en-shrouds defendant Inland Industries,
Inc. could be validly pierced, and a host of cases decided by our High Court is
supportive of this view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it held
that 'when the veil of corporate fiction is made as a shield to perpetuate
fraud and/or confuse legitimate issues, the same should be pierced.' <span class="GramE">(Republic vs. Razon, 20 SCRA 234; A.D. Santos, <span style="">Inc. </span>vs. Vasquez, 22 SCRA 1156; Emilio
Cano Enterprises, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 13 SCRA 290).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost in the same vein is the dictum
enunciated by the same court in the case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue
vs. Norton &amp; Harrison Co., (11 SCRA 714), that ‘Where a corporation is
merely an adjunct, business conduit or alter ego, the fiction of separate and
distinct corporate entity should be disregarded'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution of <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="9">29
 September 1987</st1:date>, the respondent Court of Appeals, on the contention
again of petitioner that the finding that defendant corporation is his mere
alter ego is not supported by the evidence and has no legal justification,
ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The contention . . . is nothing but an empty assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory perusal of the decision would at
once readily show on pages 11-13 of the same that said factual findings of the
court <span style="">is </span>well grounded as the
same in fact even include a portion of the very testimony of said
defendant-appellant admitting that he and his wife own 52% of the stocks of
defendant corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stipulation
of facts also show (sic) that appellant Roberto Jacinto acted in his capacity
as President/General Manager of defendant corporation and that 'all the goods
covered by the three (3) Letters of Credit (Annexes "A",
"B" &amp; "C") and paid for under the Bills of Exchange
(Annexes "D", "E" &amp; "F") were delivered to
and received by defendant Inland Industries, Inc. through its co-defendant
Roberto A. Jacinto, its President and General Manager, who signed for and in
behalf of defendant Inland and agreed to the terms and conditions of three (3)
separate trust receipts covering the same'."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, faults the courts below for piercing the
veil of corporate fiction despite the absence of any allegation in the
complaint questioning the separate identity and existence of Inland Industries,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not accurate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While on the face of the complaint there <span style="">is </span>no specific allegation that the
corporation is a mere alter ego of petitioner, subsequent developments, from
the stipulation of facts up to the presentation of evidence and the examination
of witnesses, unequivocably show that respondent Metropolitan Bank and Trust
Company sought to prove that petitioner <span style="">and
the </span>corporation are one or that he is the corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No serious objection was heard from
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Rule 10 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Amendment</u> <u><span style="">to</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>conform</u> <u><span style="">to</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>authorize</u>

pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be
treated in all respects, as if they had been raised in the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such amendment of the pleadings as may be
necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues
may be made upon motion of any party at any time, even after judgment; but
failure so to amend does not affect the trial of these issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the evidence is objected to at the time of
trial on the ground that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the
court may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the
presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved thereby and the
objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence
would prejudice him in maintaining his action or defense upon the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may grant continuance to enable the
objecting party to meet such evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, "when evidence is presented by one party,
with the express or implied consent of the adverse party, as to issues not
alleged in the pleadings, judgment may be rendered validly as regards those
issues, which shall be considered as if they have been raised in the
