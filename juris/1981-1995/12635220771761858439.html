    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
The evidence for the prosecution tends to show the following facts:
</p><p>
Shortly after midnight of December 9, 1966, Eugenio Satajo, captain of 
the vessel "MV San Antonio", invited Jimmy Peñaflor, Jr., Ricarte 
Monsanto, Warlito Ybañez and Marcial Ortega, all dockhands at the 
Pagadian City wharf, to take a snack at a refreshment parlor located at 
the national highway in Pagadian City.  As they were walking along 
Mabini St. on their way thereto, they saw appellant Artemio Bernal 
approaching from the opposite direction.  When appellant was about six 
meters away from them, Monsanto accosted him by saying:  "Good evening, 
bay." Appellant did not respond.  Peñaflor likewise greeted him, "Good 
evening, bay." This time appellant countered by saying "Pusilon ta mo 
ron (I'll shoot you)." Whereupon he pulled out his gun, levelled it at 
Monsanto who was about 4 meters away, and fired twice.  The latter 
ducked and was not hit.
</p><p>
At this juncture, Jimmy Peñaflor, Jr., with upraised hands, approached 
appellant and said:  "Don't shoot, friend." Appellant pushed Peñaflor 
and fired two shots, hitting him on the head and the abdomen.  As 
Peñaflor fell on the pavement, Monsanto, Ybañez and Ortega ran away.  
Roberto Romales, who was at the scene of the incident, testified that 
after the trio had fled, appellant gunned down Capt. Satajo with three 
successive shots.
</p><p>
Shortly after, Monsanto, Ybañez and Ortega, accompanied by Pat. Porfirio
 Tejano of the Pagadian City Police Department, returned to the scene of
 the crime.  Patrolmen Tejano, Baton and Santos, who later arrived in a 
patrol jeep, arrested appellant.
</p><p>
The victims, Captain Satajo and Peñaflor, were brought to the clinic of 
Dr. Mateo Dayo, Jr. According to the doctor, Captain Satajo died about 
five minutes after arrival at the clinic and that the victim's death was
 due to the following gunshot wounds:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "This is to certify that Eugenio Satajo, 40 years old, in command 
of M.V. San Antonio, was given emergency treatment at the Nstra. Sra. 
dela Paz Clinic on December 10, 1966 for the following wounds sustained:
 </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> - Bullet wound 3½ inches to the right and up of the umbilicus 2½ inches from the midline 2 mm in diameter. </p>
    <p>
        - Bullet wound - left anterior axillary line 4 inches below to the left of the left nipple 3 mm. in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
        - Bullet wound - left mandibular area - 1 inch from the ear and down to the anterior (face) measuring 2 mm. in diameter.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Patient was admitted semiconscious, pale, weak and pulseless, was 
pronounced dead at 12:50 am. 20 min. after he was rushed to our clinic.

      <br> 
    [EXHIBIT "C"] </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
Peñaflor expired at about 5:50 in the morning of the following day.  Dr.
 Dayo likewise ascribed his death to gunshot wounds which he described 
in the autopsy report as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "This is to certify that Jimmy Peñaflor, Jr., 18 years old, of San
 Pedro District, Pagadian, Zamboanga del Sur, was treated at the Nstra. 
Sra. dela Paz Clinic on 12-10-66 for the following wounds sustained: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.    Bullet wound 2 mm in diameter 2½ inches above umbilicus - 1 inch to the right of the midline </p>
    <p> 2.    Bullet wound 3 mm in diameter 6 inches to the right at the
 same level of the umbilicus - Distance between the 2 wounds is 5½ 
inches. </p>
    <p>
        3.    Head injury - Bullet wound occipital region leftside 3 
inches from the back of the left ear - measuring approximately 2 mm in 
diameter.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Whitish material simulating brain matter was expressed out of the 
wound while applying pressure dressing to control the bleeding.
  </p>
  <p>
    The patient was admitted unconscious with a normal pulse and blood 
pressure.  He never regained consciousness.  Was pronounced dead at 7:50
 am 12/10/66 seven hours after admission.

  </blockquote>
<p>
The appellant admitted having shot to death Captain Satajo and Jimmy 
Peñaflor, Jr., but pleaded self defense to justify his act.  He 
vehemently denied having fired at Monsanto.  He alleged that on the 
night in question, a group of six or seven men tried to stage a hold-up 
while he was on his way home.  His version of the incident, as 
summarized by the trial court, is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On the other hand, the defense consists mainly of the testimony 
of the defendant Artemio Bernal.  He declared that at about midnight 
during the incident in question, he was going home towards his house at 
the Bernal Hotel.  On his way, he met people who were all armed to 
commit robbery against him.  There were six or seven of them armed with 
knives and pistols.  One of them said, 'This is a holdup.' At first, he 
did not recognized who uttered these words but he found out in the 
morning that his name was Capt. Eugenio Satajo.  The companions of Capt.
 Satajo said, 'We will kill this person because he knows us'.  That 
person who said that was Ricarte Monsanto.  At this juncture, Bernal 
grabbed the weapon of Capt. Satajo and ran away.  Ricarte Monsanto 
blocked his way and so he fired two warning shots.  Then Jimmy Peñaflor 
who was armed with a bladed weapon blocked his way.  Because Jimmy was 
near Bernal, he shot him, and after shooting Jimmy, Bernal continued 
running to the Bernal Hotel.  The group of men chased him and almost 
overtook him.  So he turned back and shot Capt. Satajo who was among the
 pursuers.  After Satajo fell, he threw away the pistol.  The companions
 of Satajo ran away when Capt. Satajo fell.  At this juncture, Adriano 
Bernal, father of the defendant, approached the latter and said, 'Boy, 
you surrender; we will surrender to the police checkpoint'.  But they 
could not surrender because at the precise moment a police wagon arrived
 precisely to arrest the defendant.  The policeman who arrested the 
defendant were Pat. Porfirio Tejano, Pat. Baton and Pat. Santos.  The 
defendant admits that there has never been any grudge or 
misunderstanding between him on the one hand and Jimmy Peñaflor, Ricarte
 Monsanto, and Warlito Ybañez on the other.  He never saw Capt. Satajo 
before the incident.  He denies the version of both Ricarte and Warlito.
  The gun which was used by the defendant in shooting jimmy Peñaflor, 
Jr. and Capt. Satajo was never recovered.  This testimony of Artemio 
Bernal is substantially corroborated by the witness Artemio Lagbunan and
 his father Adriano Bernal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We find no error committed by the trial court in rejecting the 
appellant's theory of self defense.  It is a settled principle that an 
accused who admits having inflicted the injuries which caused the death 
of another has the burden of proving self defense with clear and 
convincing evidence; and if such evidence is of doubtful veracity, the 
defense must fail.  The trial court characterized the evidence adduced 
in support of appellant's plea as unconvincing and improbable.  It 
explained why:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The story of Artemio Bernal that Captain Satajo was the 
leader of a gang of six or seven who staged a hold-up against him is 
highly incredible.  It is admitted that Captain Satajo, who is the 
captain of an inter-island vessel 'San Antonio', is a stranger of the 
place, being a resident of Manila.  He has a wife and family of three 
children and earns a salary of P450.00 a month.  The court refuses to 
believe that a man with a stable income and who is a stranger in 
Pagadian would lead a group of hold-uppers to commit robbery against the
 defendant.  Besides, the defendant is only a student, 22 years old at 
the time he testified in court.  What thing of value can be robbed from a
 man who is still dependent for his own livelihood from his own father?"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We agree with the trial court's conclusion that appellant is criminally 
liable for the death of Capt. Satajo and Jimmy Peñaflor.  We have 
carefully and painstakingly reviewed the evidence and We find no reason 
to discredit the eyewitnesses for the prosecution, whose testimonies 
appear to be a candid and truthful narrative of the incident.
</p><p>
But while the lower court correctly convicted appellant of homicide for 
the death of Capt. Satajo, it erred in finding him guilty of the crime 
of murder for the slaying of Jimmy Peñaflor, Jr.  According to the trial
 court, the crime was attended by the qualifying circumstance of 
treachery because "the killing of Peñaflor was sudden and unexpected." 
In the People's brief, however, the Solicitor General submits a contrary
 view.
</p><p>
To constitute treachery, it is essential that the method, form or means 
adopted must be deliberately chosen to insure its execution without the 
risk to the offender arising from the defense which the victim might 
make.  In the case at bar, while the appellants' attack on the deceased 
Peñaflor was sudden and unexpected, it does not appear that he had 
consciously intended such mode of attack to facilitate the perpetration 
of the homicide without risk to himself.  Appellant pulled out his gun 
after he was greeted by Monsanto and Peñaflor.  There is however no 
evidence to even intimate that before their meeting appellant had 
already formed the intention to kill Peñaflor.  On the contrary, it is 
undisputed that their meeting was wholly accidental.  There is no 
showing that prior to the incident there was any misunderstanding or bad
 blood between appellant and the deceased Peñaflor.  If appellant drew 
out his gun and fired at his victim, it was made wholly on impulse, as 
he was apparently irritated by the greetings made by Monsanto and 
Peñaflor.
</p><p>
The Solicitor General further disputes the trial court's finding that 
appellant actually fired at Monsanto and missed, and thus recommends 
that appellant be acquitted of the charge for attempted homicide in 
Criminal Case No. 3301.  We sustain the position taken by the Solicitor 
General.  Thus -
</p><p>
"Moreover, this brief entertains serious doubts that appellant actually 
fired at Ricarte Monsanto but missed.  Monsanto's testimony (t.s.n., 
Stenog Villamero, pp. 22-23) that he ducked and thus avoided the shots 
that were fired at him from a mere four meters away strains belief.  A 
.22 caliber bullet, according to ballistic tables, travels at a speed of
 1335 ft. per sec. and in flight is imperceptible to the naked eye.  It 
would take some pretty fancy ducking to avoid it."
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    [a]  The lower court's decision in Criminal Case No. 3299 convicting
 appellant Artemio Bernal of homicide is hereby affirmed with the 
modification that appellant shall suffer an indeterminate penalty 
ranging from SIX (6) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY OF <em>prision correccional</em>,
 as minimum, to TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY of prision temporal, 
as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of Eugenio Satajo in the amount 
of P30,000.00
  </p>
  <p> [b]  The judgment in Criminal Case No. 3300 is hereby set aside 
and, in lieu thereof, another one is entered finding appellant guilty of
 the crime of homicide and sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty 
ranging from SIX (6) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY of <em>prision correccional</em>,
 as minimum, to TWELVE (12) YEARS AND ONE (1) DAY of prision temporal, 
as maximum, and to indemnify the heirs of Jimmy Peñaflor, Jr. in the sum
 of P30,000.00 </p>
  <p>
    [c]  In Criminal Case No. 3301, appellant is hereby acquitted of the crime of attempted murder, with costs de oficio.
  </p>
