				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision and resolution of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 14530 affirming the earlier decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Laguna, Branch 37, at Calamba, in the consolidated RTC
Civil Case Nos. 802-84-C and 803-84-C entitled "Heirs of Eugenia V. Roxas,
Inc. v. Rebecca Boyer-Roxas" and Heirs of Eugenia V. Roxas, Inc. v.
Guillermo Roxas," the dispositive portion of which reads<span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered in
favor of the plaintiff and against the defendants, by ordering as it <span style="">is<i> </i></span>hereby ordered that:</blockquote>

(Rollo, p. 36)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In two (2) separate complaints for recovery of possession filed
with the Regional Trial Court of Laguna against petitioners Rebecca Boyer-Roxas
and Guillermo Roxas respectively, respondent corporation, Heirs of Eugenia V.
Roxas, Inc., prayed for the ejectment of the petitioners from buildings inside
the Hidden Valley Springs Resort located at Limao, Calauan, Laguna allegedly
owned by the respondent corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of petitioner Rebecca Boyer-Roxas (Civil Case No.
802-84-C), the respondent corporation alleged that Rebecca is in possession of
two (2) houses, one of which is still under construction, built at the expense
of the respondent corporation; and that her occupancy on the two (2) houses was
only upon the tolerance of the respondent corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of petitioner Guillermo Roxas (Civil Case No. 803-84-C),
the respondent corporation alleged that Guillermo occupies a house which was
built at the expense of the former during the time when Guillermo's father,
Eriberto Roxas, was still living and was the general manager of the respondent
corporation; that the house was originally intended as a recreation hall but
was converted for the residential use of Guillermo; and that Guillermo's
possession over the house and lot was only upon the tolerance of the respondent
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In both cases, the respondent corporation alleged that the
petitioners never paid rentals for the use of the buildings and the lots and
that they ignored the demand letters for them to vacate the buildings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their separate answers, the petitioners traversed the
allegations in the complaint by stating that they are heirs of Eugenia V. Roxas
and therefore, co-owners of the Hidden Valley Springs Resort; and as co-owners
of the property, they have the right to stay within its premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases were consolidated and tried jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial, the parties limited the issues as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1) whether plaintiff is entitled to recover the questioned
premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2) whether plaintiff is
entitled to reasonable rental for occupancy of the premises in question;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  3) whether the defendant is
legally authorized to pierce the veil of corporate fiction and interpose the
same as a defense in an accion publiciana;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  4) whether the defendants
are truly builders in good faith, entitled to occupy the questioned premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  5) whether plaintiff is
entitled to damages and reasonable compensation for the use of the questioned
premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  6) whether the defendants
are entitled to their counterclaim to recover moral and exemplary damages as
well as attorney's fees in the two cases;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  7) whether the presence and
occupancy by the defendants on the premises in questioned (sic) hampers, deters
or impairs plaintiff's operation of Hidden Valley Springs Resort; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>  8) whether or not <span style="">a </span>unilateral and sudden withdrawal of
plaintiff's tolerance allowing defendants' occupancy of the premises in
questioned (sic) is unjust enrichment." (Original Records, 486)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of the plaintiff respondent corporation Presiding
Judge Francisco Ma. Guerrero of Branch 34 issued an Order dated April 25, 1986
inhibiting himself from further trying the case.  The cases were re-raffled to Branch 37 presided by Judge Odilon
Bautista.  Judge Bautista continued the
hearing of the cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of the petitioners (defendants below) and their
counsel to attend the October 22, 1986 hearing despite notice, and upon motion
of the respondent corporation, the court issued on the same day, October 22,
1986, an Order considering the cases submitted for decision.  At this stage of the proceedings, the
petitioners had not yet presented their evidence while the respondent
corporation had completed the presentation of its evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the respondent corporation upon which the lower
court based its decision is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"To support the complaints, the plaintiff offered the
testimonies of Maria Milagros Roxas and that of Victoria Roxas Villarta as well
as Exhibits 'A' to 'M-3'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence of the plaintiff established the following:  that the plaintiff, Heirs of Eugenia V.
Roxas, Incorporated, was incorporated on December 4, 1962 (Exh. 'C') with the
primary purpose of engaging in agriculture to develop the properties inherited
from Eugenia V. Roxas and that of Eufrocino Roxas; that the Articles of
Incorporation of the plaintiff, in 1971, was amended to allow it to engage in
the resort business (Exh. 'C-1'); that the incorporators as original members of
the board of directors of the plaintiff were all members of the same family,
with Eufrocino Roxas having the biggest share; that accordingly, the plaintiff
put up a resort known as Hidden Valley Springs Resort on a<i> </i>portion of
its land located at Bo. Limao, Calauan, Laguna, and covered by TCT No. 32639
(Exhs. 'A' and 'A-1'); that improvements were introduced in the resort by the
plaintiff and among them were cottages, houses or buildings, swimming pools, <span style="">tennis court, restaurant </span>and open
pavilions; that the house near the Balugbugan Pool (Exh. 'B-1') being occupied
by Rebecca B. Roxas was originally intended as staff house but later used as<i>
</i>the residence of Eriberto Roxas, deceased husband of the defendant Rebecca
Boyer-Roxas and father of Guillermo Roxas; that this house presently being
occupied by Rebecca B. Roxas was built from corporate funds; that the
construction of the unfinished house (Exh. 'B­-2') was started by the defendant
Rebecca Boyer-Roxas and her husband Eriberto Roxas; that the third building
(Exh. 'B-3') presently being occupied by Guillermo Roxas was originally
intended as a recreation hall but later converted as a residential house; that
this house was built also from corporate funds; that the said house occupied by
Guillermo Roxas when it was being built had nipa roofing but was later changed
to galvanized iron sheets; that at the beginning, it had no partition
downstairs and the second floor was an open space; that the conversion from a
recreation hall to a residential house was with the knowledge of Eufrocino
Roxas and was not objected to by any of the Board of Directors of the
plaintiff; that most of the materials used in converting the building into a
residential house came from the materials left by Coppola, film producer, who
filmed the movie 'Apocalypse Now'; that Coppola left the materials as part of
his payment for rents of the rooms that he occupied in the resort; that after
the said recreation hall was converted into a residential house, defendant
Guillermo Roxas moved in and occupied the same together with his family
sometime in 1977 or 1978; that during the time Eufrocino Roxas was still alive,
Eriberto Roxas was the general manager of the corporation and there was seldom
any board meeting; that Eufrocino Roxas together with Eriberto Roxas were (sic)
the ones who were running the corporation; that during this time, Eriberto
Roxas was the restaurant and wine concessionaire of the resort; that after the
death of Eufrocino Roxas, Eriberto Roxas continued as the general manager until
his death in 1980; that after the death of Eriberto Roxas in 1980, the
defendants Rebecca B. Roxas and Guillermo Roxas, committed acts that impeded
the plaintiff's expansion and normal operation of the resort; that the
plaintiff could not even use its own pavilions, kitchen and other facilities
because of the acts of the defendants which led to the filing of criminal cases
in court; that cases were even filed before the Ministry of Tourism, Bureau of
Domestic Trade and the Office of the President by the parties herein; that the
defendants violated the resolution and orders of the Ministry of Tourism dated
July 28, 1983, August 3, 1983 and November 26, 1984 (Exhs. 'G', 'H' and 'H-1')
which ordered them or the corporation they represent to desist from and to turn
over immediately to the plaintiff the management and operation of the
restaurant and wine outlets of the said resort (Exh. 'G-1'); that the
defendants also violated the decision of the Bureau of Domestic Trade dated
October 23, 1983 (Exh. 'C'); that on August 27, 1983, because of the acts of
the defendants, the Board of Directors of the plaintiff adopted Resolution No.
83-12 series of 1983 (Exh. 'F') authorizing the ejectment of the defendants
from the premises occupied by them; that on September 1, 1983, demand letters
were sent to Rebecca Boyer-Roxas and Guillermo Roxas (Exhs. 'D' and 'D-1')
demanding that they vacate the respective premises they occupy; and that the
dispute between the plaintiff and the defendants was brought before the
barangay level and the same was not settled (Exhs. 'E' and 'E-1')."
(Original Records, pp. 454-456)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners appealed the decision to the Court of
Appeals.  However, as stated earlier,
the appellate court affirmed the lower court's decision.  The petitioners' motion for reconsideration
was likewise denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a<i> </i>resolution dated February 5, 1992, we gave due course
to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners now contend:</p>

<blockquote>I    Respondent Court erred when it refused to
pierce the veil of corporate fiction over private respondent and maintain the
petitioners in their possession and/or occupancy of the subject premises
considering that petitioners are owners of aliquot part of the properties of
private respondent.  Besides, private
respondent itself discarded the mantle of corporate fiction by acts and/or
omissions of its board of directors and/or stockholders.</blockquote>

<blockquote>II  The respondent Court
erred in not holding that petitioners were in fact denied due process or their
day in court brought about by the gross negligence of their former counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III  The respondent Court
misapplied the law when it ordered petitioner Rebecca Boyer-Roxas to remove the
unfinished building in RTC Case No. 802-84-C, when the trial court opined that
she spent her own funds for the construction thereof.  (CA Rollo, pp. 17-18)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Were the petitioners denied due process of law in the lower
court?</p>

<p class="BODY">After the cases were re-raffled to the sala of Presiding Judge
Odilon Bautista of Branch 37 the following events transpired:</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 3, 1986, the lower court issued an Order setting the
hearing of the cases on July 21, 1986.  Petitioner Rebecca V. Roxas received a copy of the Order on July 15,
1986, while petitioner Guillermo Roxas received his copy on July 18, 1986.  Atty. Conrado Manicad, the petitioners'
counsel received another copy of the Order on July 11, 1986.  (Original Records, p. 260)</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of the respondent corporation's counsel, the lower
court issued an Order dated July 15, 1986 cancelling the July 21, 1986 hearing
and resetting the hearing to August 11, 1986.  (Original records, 262-263) Three separate copies of the order were sent
and received by the petitioners and their counsel.  (Original Records, pp. 268, 269, 271)</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to cancel and re-schedule the August 11, 1986 hearing
filed by the respondent corporation's counsel was denied in an Order dated
August 8, 1986.  Again separate copies
of the Order were sent and received by the petitioners and their counsel.  (Original Records, pp. 276-279)</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing held on August 11, 1986, only Atty. Benito P.
Fabie, counsel for the respondent corporation appeared.  Neither the petitioners nor their counsel
appeared despite notice of hearing.  The
lower court then issued an Order on the same date, to wit:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"<u>O</u>
<u>R</u> <u>D</u> <u>E</u> <u>R</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>When these cases were called for continuation of trial, Atty.
Benito P. Fabie appeared before this Court, however, the defendants and their
lawyer despite receipt of the Order setting the case for hearing today failed
to appear.  On Motion of Atty. Fabie,
further cross examination of witness Victoria Vallarta is hereby considered as
having been waived.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiff is hereby given twenty (20) days from today within
which to submit formal offer of evidence and defendants are also given ten (10)
days from receipt of such formal offer of evidence to file their objection
thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the meantime, hearing in these cases is set to September 29,
1986 at 10:00 o'clock in the morning." (Original Records, p. 286)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Copies of the Order were sent and received by the petitioners and
their counsel on the following dates -- ­Rebecca Boyer-Roxas on August 20,
1986, Guillermo Roxas on August 26, 1986, and Atty. Conrado Manicad on
September 19, 1986.  (Original Records,
pp. 288-290)</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 1, 1986, the respondent corporation filed its
"Formal Offer of Evidence." In an Order dated September 29, 1986, the
lower court issued an Order admitting exhibits "A" to "M-3"
submitted by the respondent corporation in its "Formal Offer of Evidence x
x x there being no objection x x x." (Original Records, p. 418) Copies of
this Order were sent and received by the petitioners and their counsel on the
following dates:  Rebecca Boyer-Roxas on
October 9, 1986; Guillermo Roxas on October 9, 1986 and Atty. Conrado Manicad
on October 4, 1986 (Original Records, pp. 420, 421, 428).</p>

<p class="BODY">The scheduled hearing on September 29, 1986 did not push through
as the petitioners and their counsel were not present prompting Atty. Benito
Fabie, the respondent corporation's counsel to move that the cases be submitted
for decision.  The lower court denied
the motion and set the cases for hearing on October 22, 1986.  However, in its Order dated September 29,
1986, the court <u>warned</u> that in the event the petitioners and their
counsel failed to appear on the next scheduled hearing, the court shall
consider the cases submitted for decision based on the evidence on record.  (Original Records, p. 429, 430 and 431)</p>

<p class="BODY">Separate copies of this Order were sent and received by the
petitioners and their counsel on the following dates:  Rebecca Boyer-Roxas on October 9, 1986, Guillermo Roxas on
October 9, 1986; and Atty. Conrado Manicad on October 1, 1986.  (Original Records, pp. 429-430)</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite notice, the petitioners and their counsel again failed to
attend the scheduled October 22, 1986 hearing.  Atty. Fabie representing the respondent corporation was present.  Hence, in its Order dated October 22, 1986,
on motion of Atty. Fabie and pursuant to the order dated September 29, 1986,
the Court considered the cases submitted for decision.  (Original Records, p. 436)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1986, the respondent corporation, filed a
"Manifestation", stating that "x x x it is submitting without
further argument its ‘Opposition to the Motion for Reconsideration’ for the
consideration of the Honorable Court in resolving subject incident."
(Original Records, p. 442)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1986, the lower court issued an Order, to wit:<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"<u>O</u>
<u>R</u> <u>D</u> <u>E</u> <u>R</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Considering that the Court up to this date has not received any
Motion for Reconsideration filed by the defendants in the above-entitled cases,
the Court cannot act on the Opposition to Motion for Reconsideration filed by
the plaintiff and received by the Court on November 14, 1986." (Original
Records, p. 446)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On January 15, 1987, the lower court rendered the questioned
decision in the two (2) cases.  (Original Records, pp. 453-459)</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 20, 1987, Atty. Conrado Manicad, the petitioners'
counsel filed an Ex-Parte Manifestation and attached thereto, a motion for
reconsideration of the October 22, 1986 Order submitting the cases for
decision.  He prayed that the Order be
set aside and the cases be re-opened for reception of evidence for the petitioners.  He averred that:  1) within the reglementary period he prepared the motion for
reconsideration and among other documents, the draft was sent to his law office
thru his messenger; after signing the final copies, he caused the service of a
copy to the respondent corporation's counsel with the instruction that the copy
of the Court be filed; however, there was a miscommunication between his
secretary and messenger in that the secretary mailed the copy for the
respondent corporation's counsel and placed the rest in an envelope for the
messenger to file the same in court but the messenger thought that it was the
secretary who would file it; it was only later on when it was discovered that
the copy for the Court has not yet been filed and that such failure to file the
motion for reconsideration was due to excusable neglect and/or accident.  The motion for reconsideration contained the
following allegations:  that on the date
set for hearing (October 22, 1986), he was on his way to Calamba to attend the
hearing but his car suffered transmission breakdown; and that despite efforts
to repair said transmission, the car remained inoperative resulting in his
absence at the said hearing.  (Original
Records, pp. 460-469)</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 3, 1987, Atty. Manicad filed a motion for
reconsideration of the January 15, 1987 decision.  He explained that he had to file the motion because the receiving
clerk refused to admit the motion for reconsideration attached to the ex-parte
manifestation because there was no proof of service to the other party.  Included in the motion for reconsideration
was a notice of hearing of the motion on February 3, 1987.  (Original Records, p. 476-A)</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 4, 1987, the respondent corporation through its
counsel filed a Manifestation and Motion manifesting that they received the
copy of the motion for reconsideration only today (February 4, 1987), hence
they prayed for the postponement of the hearing.  (Original Records, pp. 478-479)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, February 4, 1987, the lower court issued an
Order setting the hearing on February 13, 1987 on the ground that it received
the motion for reconsideration late.  Copies of this Order were sent separately to the petitioners and their
counsel.  The records show that Atty.
Manicad received his copy on February 11, 1987.  As regards the petitioners, the records reveal that Rebecca
Boyer-Roxas did not receive her copy while as regards Guillermo Roxas, somebody
signed for him but did not indicate when the copy was received.  (Original Records, pp. 481-483)</p>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled February 13, 1987 hearing, the counsels for the
parties were present.  However, the
hearing was reset for March 6, 1987 in order to allow the respondent
corporation to file its opposition to the motion for reconsideration.  (Order dated February 13, 1987, Original
Records, p. 486)  Copies of the Order
were sent and received by the petitioners and their counsel on the following
dates:  Rebecca Boyer-Roxas on February
23, 1987; Guillermo Roxas on February 23, 1987 and Atty. Manicad on February
19, 1987.  (Original Records, pp. 487,
489-490)</p>

<p class="BODY">The records are not clear as to whether or not the scheduled
hearing on March 6, 1987 was held.  Nevertheless, the records reveal that on March 13, 1987, the lower court
issued an Order denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The well-settled doctrine is that the client is bound by the
mistakes of his lawyer.  (Aguila v.
Court of First Instance of Batangas, Branch I, 160 SCRA 352 [1988]; See also
Vivero v. Santos, et al., 98 Phil. 500 [1956]; Isaac v. Mendoza, 89 Phil. 279
[1951]; Montes v. Court of First Instance of Tayabas, 48 Phil. 640 [1926];
People v. Manzanilla, 43 Phil. 167 [1922]; United States v. Dungca, 27 Phil.
274 [1914]; and United States v. Umali, 15 Phil. 33 [1910]) This rule, however,
has its exceptions.  Thus, in several
cases, we ruled that the party is not bound by the actions of his counsel in
case the gross negligence of the counsel resulted in the client's deprivation
of his property without due process of law.  In the case of <u>Legarda</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>o</u><u><span style="">f</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Appeals</u> (195 SCRA 418 [1991]), we said:</p>

<blockquote>"In People's Homesite &amp; Housing Corp. v. Tiongco and
Escasa (12 SCRA 471 [1964]), this Court ruled as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Procedural technicality should not be made <span style="">a </span>bar to the vindication of <span style="">a legitimate </span>grievance.  When such technicality deserts from being an aid to justice, the courts
are justified in excepting from its operation a particular case.  Where there was something fishy and
suspicious about the actuations of the former counsel of petitioners in the
case at bar, in that he did not give any significance at all to the processes
of the court, which has proven prejudicial to the rights of said clients, under
a lame and flimsy explanation that the court's processes just escaped his
attention, it is held that said lawyer deprived his clients of their day in court,
thus entitling said clients to petition for relief from judgment despite the
lapse of the reglementary period for filing said period for filing said
petition.'</p>

<blockquote>"In Escudero v. Judge Dulay (158 SCRA 69 [1988]), this Court,
in holding that the counsel's blunder in procedure is an exception to the rule
that the client is bound by the mistakes of counsel, made the following
disquisition:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Petitioners contend, through their new counsel, that the judgment
rendered against them by the respondent court was null and void, because they
were therein deprived of their day in court and divested of their property
without due process of law, through the gross ignorance, mistake and negligence
of their previous counsel.  They acknowledge
that, while as a rule, clients are bound by the mistake of their counsel, the
rule should not be applied automatically to their case, <span style="">as<i> </i></span>their trial counsel's blunder in procedure and gross
ignorance of <span style="">existing </span>jurisprudences
changed their cause of action and violated their substantial rights.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘We are impressed with petitioner's contentions.</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'While this Court is cognizant of the rule that, generally, a
client will suffer consequences of the negligence, mistake or lack of
competence of his counsel, in the interest of justice and equity, exceptions
may be made to such rule, in accordance with the facts and circumstances of
each case.  Adherence to the general
rule would, in the instant case, result in the outright deprivation of their
property through a technicality.'</p>

<blockquote>"In its questioned decision dated November 19, 1989 the Court
of Appeals found, in no uncertain terms, the negligence of the then counsel for
petitioners when he failed to file the proper motion to dismiss or to draw a
compromise agreement if it was true that they agreed on <span style="">a </span>settlement of the case; or in simply filing an answer; and
that after having been furnished a copy of the decision by the court he failed
to appeal therefrom or to file a petition for relief from the order declaring
petitioners in default.  In all these
instances the appellate court found said counsel negligent but his acts were
held to <span style="">bind his client, petitioners
herein, nevertheless.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court disagrees and finds that the negligence of counsel in
this case appears to be so gross and inexcusable.  This was compounded by the fact, that after petitioner gave said
counsel another chance to make up for his omissions by asking him to file a
petition for annulment of the judgment in the appellate court, again counsel
abandoned the case of petitioner in that after he received a copy of the
adverse judgment of the appellate court, he did not do anything to save the
situation or inform his client of the judgment.  He allowed the judgment to lapse and become final.  Such reckless and gross negligence should
not be allowed to bind the petitioner.  Petitioner was thereby effectively deprived of her day in court."
(at pp. 426-427)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The herein petitioners', however, are not similarly situated as
the parties mentioned in the abovecited cases.  We cannot rule that they, too, were victims of the gross negligence of
their counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are to be blamed for the October 22, 1986 order
issued by the lower court submitting the cases for decision.  They received notices of the scheduled hearings
and yet they did not do anything.  More
specifically, the parties received notice of the Order dated September 29, 1986
with the <u>warning</u> that if they fail to attend the October 22, 1986
hearing, the cases would be submitted for decision based on the evidence on
record.  Earlier, at the scheduled
hearing on September 29, 1986, the counsel for the respondent corporation moved
that the cases be submitted for decision for failure of the petitioners and
their counsel to attend despite notice.  The lower court denied the motion and gave the petitioners and their
counsel another chance by rescheduling the October 22, 1986 hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the petitioners knew all along that their counsel was not
attending the scheduled hearings.  They
did not take steps to change their counsel or make him attend to their cases
until it was too late.  On the contrary,
they continued to retain the services of Atty. Manicad knowing fully well his
lapses vis-a-vis their cases.  They,
therefore, cannot raise the alleged gross negligence of their counsel resulting
in their denial of due process to warrant the reversal of the lower court's
decision.  In a similar case, Aguila v.
Court of First Instance of Batangas, Branch 1 (<u>supra</u>), we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"In the instant case, the petitioner should have noticed the
succession of errors committed by his counsel and taken appropriate steps for
his replacement before it was altogether too late.  He did not.  On the
contrary, he continued to retain his counsel through the series of proceedings
that all resulted in the rejection of <span style="">his
</span>cause, obviously through such counsel's 'ineptitude' and, let it be
added, the clients' forbearance.  The
petitioner's reverses should have cautioned him that his lawyer was mishandling
his case and moved him to seek the help of other counsel, which he did in the
end but rather tardily.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now petitioner wants us to nullify all of the antecedent
proceedings and recognize his earlier claims to the disputed property on the
justification that his counsel was grossly inept.  Such a reason is hardly plausible as the petitioner's new counsel
should know.  Otherwise, all <span style="">a </span>defeated party would have to do to
salvage his <span style="">case </span>is claim
neglect or mistake on the part of his counsel <span style="">as a </span>ground for reversing the adverse judgment.  There would be no end to litigation if these
were allowed as every shortcoming of counsel could be the subject of challenge
by his client through another counsel who, if he is also found wanting, would
likewise be disowned by the same client through another counsel, and so on ad
infinitum.  This would render court,
proceedings indefinite, tentative and subject to reopening at any time by the
mere subterfuge of replacing counsel." (at pp. 357­-358)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We now discuss the merits of the cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first assignment of error, the petitioners maintain that
their possession of the questioned properties must be respected in view of
their ownership of an aliquot portion of all the properties of the respondent
corporation being stockholders thereof.  They propose that the veil of corporate fiction be pierced, considering
the circumstances under which the respondent corporation was formed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Originally, the questioned properties belonged to Eugenia V.
Roxas.  After her death, the heirs of
Eugenia V. Roxas, among them the petitioners herein, decided to form a
corporation - Heirs of Eugenia V. Roxas, Incorporated (private respondent
herein) with the inherited properties as capital of the corporation.  The corporation was incorporated on December
4, 1962 with the primary purpose of engaging in agriculture to develop the
inherited properties.  The Articles of
Incorporation of the respondent corporation were amended in 1971 to allow it to
engage in the resort business.  Accordingly, the corporation put up a resort known as Hidden Valley Springs
Resort where the questioned properties are located.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts, however, do not justify the position taken by the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent is a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> corporation.  As such, it has a juridical personality of
its own separate from the members composing it.  (Western Agro Industrial Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 188
SCRA 709 [1990]; Tan Boon Bee &amp; Co., Inc. v. Jarencio, 163 SCRA 205 [1988];
Yutivo Sons Hardware Company v. Court of Tax Appeals, 1 SCRA 160 [1961]; Emilio
Cano Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations, 13 SCRA 290 [1965])
There is no dispute that title over the questioned land where the Hidden Valley
Springs Resort is located is registered in the name of the corporation.  The records also show that the staff house
being occupied by petitioner Rebecca Boyer-Roxas and the recreation hall which
was later on converted into a residential house occupied by petitioner
Guillermo Roxas are owned by the respondent corporation.  Regarding properties owned by a corporation,
we stated in the case of <u>Stockholders</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">F</span></u><span style="">. </span><u>Guanzon</u> <u>and</u> <u>Sons,</u>
<u><span style="">Inc</span></u><span style="">. <u>v</u>. </span><u>Register</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> </span><u>Deeds</u> <u>o</u><u><span style="">f</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Manila</u>, (6 SCRA 373 [1962]): </p>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x Properties registered in the
name of the corporation are owned by it as an entity separate and distinct from
its members.  While shares of stock
constitute personal property, they do not represent property of the
corporation.  The corporation has
property of its own which consists chiefly of real estate (Nelson v. Owen, 113
Ala., 372, 21 So. 75; Morrow v. Gould, 145 Iowa 1, 123 N.W. 743).  A share of stock only typifies an aliquot
part of the corporation's property, or the right to share in its proceeds to
that extent when distributed according to law and equity (Hall &amp; Faley v.
Alabama Terminal, 173 Ala., 398, 56 So. 235), but its holder is not the owner
of any part of the capital of the corporation (Bradley v. Bauder, 36 Ohio St.,
28).  Nor is he entitled to the
possession of any definite portion of its property or assets (Gottfried v.
Miller, 104 U.S., 521; Jones v. Davis, 35 Ohio St., 474).  The stockholder is not a co-owner or tenant
in common of the corporate property (Harton v. Johnston, 166 Ala., 317, 51 So.,
992)." (at pp. 375-376)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners point out that their occupancy of the staff house
which was later used as the residence of Eriberto Roxas, husband of petitioner
Rebecca Boyer-­Roxas and the recreation hall which was converted into a
residential house were with the blessings of Eufrocino Roxas, the deceased
husband of Eugenia V. Roxas, who was the majority and controlling stockholder
of the corporation.  In his lifetime,
Eufrocino Roxas together with Eriberto Roxas, the husband of petitioner Rebecca
Boyer-Roxas, and the father of petitioner Guillermo Roxas managed the
corporation.  The Board of Directors did
not object to such an arrangement.  The
petitioners argue that "x x x the authority thus given by Eufrocino Roxas
for the conversion of the recreation hall into a residential house can no
longer be questioned by the stockholders of the private respondent and/or its
board of directors for they impliedly but no less explicitly delegated such
authority to said Eufrocino Roxas." (Rollo, p. 12)</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we must emphasize that the respondent corporation has a
distinct personality separate from its members.  The corporation transacts its business only through its officers
or agents.  (Western Agro Industrial
Corporation v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>) Whatever authority these
officers or agents may have is derived from the board of directors or other
governing body unless conferred by the charter of the corporation.  An officer's power as an agent of the
corporation must be sought from the statute, charter, the by-laws or in a
delegation of authority to such officer, from the acts of the board of
directors, formally expressed or implied from a habit or custom of doing
business.  (Vicente v. Geraldez, 52 SCRA
210 [1973])</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the record shows that Eufrocino V. Roxas who
then controlled the management of the corporation, being the majority
stockholder, consented to the petitioners' stay within the questioned
properties.  Specifically, Eufrocino
Roxas gave his consent to the conversion of the recreation hall to a
residential house, now occupied by petitioner Guillermo Roxas.  The Board of Directors did not object to the
actions of Eufrocino Roxas.  The
petitioners were allowed to stay within the questioned properties until August
27, 1983, when the Board of Directors approved a Resolution ejecting the
petitioners, to wit:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"<u>R</u>
<u>E</u> <u>S</u> <u>O</u> <u>L</u> <u>U</u> <u>T</u> <u>I</u> <u>O</u> <u>N</u>  <u>No</u>. <u>83-12</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>RESOLVED, That Rebecca B. Roxas and
Guillermo Roxas, and all persons claiming under them, be ejected from their
occupancy of the Hidden Valley Springs compound on which their houses have been
constructed and/or are being constructed only on tolerance of the Corporation
and without any contract therefor, in order to <span style="">give way<i> </i></span>to the Corporation's expansion and improvement
program and obviate prejudice to the operation of the Hidden Valley Springs
Resort by their continued interference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>RESOLVED, Further that the services of
Atty. Benito P. Fabie be engaged and that he be authorized as he is hereby
authorized to effect the ejectment, <span style="">including
</span>the <span style="">filing </span>of the
corresponding suits, if necessary to do so." (Original Records, p. 327)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find nothing irregular in the adoption of the Resolution by
the Board of Directors.  The
petitioners' stay within the questioned properties was merely by tolerance of
the respondent corporation in deference to the wishes of Eufrocino Roxas, who
during his lifetime, controlled and managed the corporation.  Eufrocino Roxas’ actions could not have
bound the corporation forever.  The
petitioners have not cited any provision of the corporation by-laws or any resolution
or act of the Board of Directors which authorized Eufrocino Roxas to allow them
to stay within the company premises forever.  We rule that in the absence of any existing contract between the
petitioners and the respondent corporation, the corporation may elect to eject
the petitioners at any time it wishes for the benefit and interest of the
respondent corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' suggestion that the veil of the corporate
fiction should be pierced is untenable.  The separate personality of the corporation may be disregarded only when
the corporation is used "as a cloak or cover for fraud or illegality, or
to work injustice, or where necessary to achieve equity or when necessary for
the protection of the creditors." (Sulo ng Bayan, Inc. v. Araneta, Inc.,
72 SCRA 347 [1976] cited in Tan Boon Bee &amp; Co., Inc., v. Jarencio, <u>supra</u>
and Western Agro Industrial Corporation v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>) The
circumstances in the present cases do not fall under any of the enumerated
categories.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third assignment of error, the petitioners insist that as
regards the unfinished building, Rebecca Boyer-Roxas is a builder in good
faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The construction of the unfinished building started when Eriberto
Roxas, husband of Rebecca Boyer-Roxas, was still alive and was the general
manager of the respondent corporation.  The couple used their own funds to finance the construction of the
building.  The Board of Directors of the
corporation, however, did not object to the construction.  They allowed the construction to continue
despite the fact that it was within the property of the corporation.  Under these circumstances, we agree with the
petitioners that the provision of Article 453 of the Civil Code should have
been applied by the lower courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 453 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If there was bad faith, not only on the part of the person
who built, planted or sown <span style="">on </span>the
land of another but also on the part of the owner of such land, the rights of
one and the other shall be the same as though both had acted in good
faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In such a case, the provisions of Article 448 of the Civil Code <u>govern</u>
the relationship between petitioner Rebecca Boyer-Roxas and the respondent
corporation, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 448.  - The owner
of the land <span style="">on </span>which anything
has been built, sown or planted in good faith, shall have the right to
appropriate as his own the works, sowing or planting after payment of the
indemnity provided for in articles 546 and 548, or to oblige the one who built
or planted to <span style="">pay </span>the price of
the land, and the one who sowed, the proper rent.  However, the builder or planter cannot be obliged to buy the land
if its value is considerably more than that of the building or trees.  In such case, he shall pay reasonable rent,
if the owner of the land does not choose to appropriate the buildings or <span style="">trees after proper indemnity.  The parties shall agree upon the terms of
the lease and in case of disagreement, the court shall fix the terms
thereof."</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the present petition is partly GRANTED.  The questioned decision of the Court of
Appeals affirming the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Laguna, Branch
37, in RTC Civil Case No. 802-84-C is MODIFIED in that subparagraphs (c) and
(d) of Paragraph 1 of the dispositive portion of the decision are deleted.  In their stead, the petitioner Rebecca
Boyer-­Roxas and the respondent corporation are ordered to follow the
provisions of Article 448 of the Civil Code as regards the questioned
unfinished building in RTC Civil Case No. 802-84-C.  The questioned decision is affirmed in all other respects.</p>
