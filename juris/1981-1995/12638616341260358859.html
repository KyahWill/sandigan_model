				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to
declare null and void the decision of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City dated October 27, 1987 in Criminal Case No.
0-51672 entitled "People of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span>
Rosario y <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>," the issues raised are (1)
whether or not double jeopardy attaches in the event of a judgment of acquittal
of the accused without a trial on the merits; and (2) whether or not the
complainant or private offended party in a criminal case can file a special
civil action for <i>certiorari</i> questioning the validity of said judgment of
acquittal without the intervention of the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1987 an information for violation of P.D. No. 772 was
filed by the Assistant City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City,
with the approval of the city fiscal, in the RTC of the same city against <span class="SpellE">Segundina</span> Rosario y <span class="SpellE">Sembrano</span>,
which reads, among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about 16th day of December, 1986, and for sometime
prior thereto and persisting up to the present, in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
said accused taking advantage of the absence or tolerance of the University of
the Philippines, the registered owner of a parcel of land covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 9462 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously succeed in occupying and/or possessing a portion of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the said property, by then and there
constructing his/her house therein for residential purposes, without the
consent and against the will of the said offended party."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment the accused pleaded not guilty and a pre-trial
conference was held on August 14, 1987 wherein the accused informed the court
that she has a title, a building permit and survey plan covering the subject
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court then issued an
order on the same day that reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the accused has a title, building permit and
a survey plan on the subject land, the Court instructs both parties to submit
their respective proffer of documentary exhibits together with their positions
as to whether this case will be heard or dismissed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The private prosecutor presented a position paper showing that
the said property belongs to the University of the Philippines (U.P.) as shown
by TCT No. 9462 covering about 493 hectares <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">at <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that the ownership of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">so-called </span>U.P.
campus under TCT No. 9462 has been sustained by several decisions of the
Supreme Court; that the supposed title of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the
</span>accused, TCT No. 5762 h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">as </span>been
cancelled by TCT No. 126671 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>the
name of <span class="SpellE">Bughay</span> Construction and Development
Corporation; that granting the accused had a title thereto, the issue is
whether<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>or not the property described in
the title is at <span class="SpellE">Pook</span> <span class="SpellE">Amorsolo</span>,
U.P. Campus which is adjacent to Bo. <span class="SpellE">Kruz-na-Ligas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; that the
alleged title of the accused shows that the property is situated in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Gulod</span>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;
that this is also shown in the tax declaration presented by her;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
that in fact the accused paid the corresponding real estate tax at <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that the criminal case should proceed as it has been shown that the area on
which the accused made the construction belongs to the U.P. without the
knowledge and consent of the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and
in </span>violation of P.D. No. 772.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span>other hand,
the accused submitted a proffer of exhibits with a manifestation tending to
show that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">applied for </span>a
building permit to construct on the lot; that the lot is covered by a title in
the name of the accused; that a copy of the building permit was also submitted
for which the accused paid for the fee; that the relocation plan of the land
and the field notes were also submitted; and that she informed U.P. of her
claim and asked them not to intrude into her property.</p>

<p class="BODY">An opposition thereto was filed by U.P. stating that the proffer
of exhibits is irregular and without basis as in fact the evidence was not
marked in the pre-trial; that the proffer of exhibits is not covered by Rule
118, Sections 1 and 2 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure; that what is
allowed only in Section 2 thereof is the marking of the exhibits for
identification purposes of documentary evidence; that the manifestation
submitting the case for resolution has no legal basis; and thus it is prayed
that the proffer of exhibits and manifestation be denied for being irregular or
not pursuant to the rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 27, 1978, the questioned decision was rendered by the
respondent judge acquitting the accused of the offense charged with costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the herein petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by the counsel
for the private offended party, U.P., in behalf of the People of the
Philippines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition seeks to
render null and void the aforesaid decision for want of due process as the
acquittal of the accused was rendered without a trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sections 1, 2, and 3 of Rule 118 of the 1985
Rules on Criminal Procedure provide as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, a pre-trial was held wherein the accused alleged
that she has a title covering the property in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent
judge thus required the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">parties to </span>submit
their proffer of documentary exhibits and their position paper as to whether or
not the case would be heard or dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

specified is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>marking for
identification of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">evidence </span>for
the parties and the waiver of objections to admissibility of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A proffer </span>of exhibits or evidence is not among those enumerated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such proffer of evidence or more specifically
an offer of evidence is generally made at the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a party</span> closes the presentation of his evidence in which case
the adverse party <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is given the </span>opportunity

respondent judge, may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be made </span>at
the pre-trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>a criminal

prosecution filed its opposition to the proffer of exhibits stating that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">it is not authorized under </span>Sections 1
and 2 of Rule 118 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure; that the documentary
evidence were not presented for marking at the pre-trial; and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the manifestation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">submitting the case for resolution with the

<blockquote>"Under these well established facts, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">it cannot </span>be stated with certainty that the accused built her
structure illegally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If somehow it is
discernible that it is more the inadequacy of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">details </span>in the state's evidence that makes it difficult for us to
arrive at definite conclusions rather than, perhaps, the actual facts
themselves, still we cannot pin responsibility on appellant (sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That moral conviction that may serve as basis
of a finding of guilt in criminal cases is only that and which is the logical
and inevitable result of the evidence on record, exclusive of any other
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Short of this, it is not
only the right of the accused to be freed, it is, even more, our constitutional
duty to acquit him." So, said the Supreme Court in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Maisug</span>, 27 SCRA 753.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">The </span>same holds true to the

inadequate evidence of the prosecution is insufficient to sustain
conviction".</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It may be added that the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>

<p class="BODY">This <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Court finds </span>that
the respondent judge committed a grave abuse of discretion in rendering the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> decision without affording the prosecution the
opportunity to have its day in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue before the Court is whether or not the accused built the
structure on the land <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">belonging </span>to
U.P.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the pre-trial, U.P. presented
its title and plan showing that the accused built a structure within its
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused by her proffer of
exhibits and manifestation pretended to have a title to the questioned
land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as stressed by U.P., the
titled property of accused is located in <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> and
not in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and said title could not cover the
very lot in question which is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> at </span><span class="SpellE">Pook</span> <span class="SpellE">Amorsolo</span>, U.P. Campus where
the structure of accused was built.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
issue cannot be determined by a mere examination of the titles and documents
submitted by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A trial on the
merits should be undertaken to determine once and for all whether the place
where the structure was built by the accused belongs to U.P. or to the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion of the trial
court that the accused did not build her structure illegally as she has a title
to the property in question is without any factual or legal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the observation of respondent judge
in the questioned decision as to "the inadequacy in details of the state's
evidence" simply demonstrates that a trial on the merits should have been
held to enable the prosecution to establish its case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, the acquittal of the accused is a
nullity for want of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution was not given the opportunity to present its evidence or even to
rebut the representations of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution is as much entitled to due process as the accused in a
criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Double jeopardy cannot be invoked as a bar to another prosecution
in this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

There is double jeopardy only when:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1)
there is a valid complaint or information; 2) filed before a competent court;
3) to which defendant had pleaded; and 4) of which he has previously been

<p class="BODY">In this case, the prosecution was deprived of an opportunity to
prosecute and prove its case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

It was not a court of competent jurisdiction when it precipitately rendered a

</span>A trial should follow a pre-trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">In this case, the Solicitor General upheld the right of U. P. to
