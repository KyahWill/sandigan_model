Rizon to set aside the Decision of the Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> convicting him of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds and sentencing him to an indeterminate penalty ranging from ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor</i> to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>; to further suffer perpetual special disqualification; to pay a fine of P303,376.71; to indemnify the Republic of the Philippines in the amount of P103,379.46 representing the amount still unaccounted for; and to pay the costs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The penalty imposed was arrived at after appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender without any aggravating circumstance in offset.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>At the time of his conviction, petitioner Rizon had already served as Municipal Treasurer of Guihulngan, Negros Oriental for 25 years, more or less, having been promoted to the said position in 1961.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The pertinent facts are basically undisputed.<br><br>On April 7, 1986, at around 2:00 p.m., an audit team of the Commission on Audit headed by Roman Adanza and composed of three others commenced its audit examination of the petitioner's accountability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> The audit examination lasted until 9:00 A.M. of April 9, 1986, with the team issuing the petitioner a demand letter with the same date for the restitution of a shortage of P314,986.82.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> In the afternoon of the same day, however, the petitioner received a second demand letter, also dated April 9, 1986, demanding the restitution of a shortage of P334,457.42<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> broken down as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">1. </td> <td width="40%">General Fund </td> <td width="10%">P 26,340.60</td> <td width="45%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>2. </td> <td>Trust and KKK Funds </td> <td>308,116.82</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp; </td> <td>__________</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>P334,457.42<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <br> vvvvvvvvvvvv</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The second demand letter, alleging a shortage of P334,457.42, came after the team had reviewed the cashbook and found "a difference."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The petitioner was relieved as Municipal Treasurer on June 16, 1986, and was replaced by Gandioso ljan, in an acting capacity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The case was then referred by the Tanodbayan to 2<sup>nd</sup> Asst. Provincial Fiscal of Negros Oriental Augusto Colina, as Deputized <i>Tanodbayan</i>, for a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Asst. Fiscal Colina, thereafter, issued a resolution on November 21, 1986, recommending that an information be filed with the Sandiganbayan against the petitioner for Malversation of Public Funds, notwithstanding his findings that the actual total shortages incurred by the petitioner had been restituted and fully reconciled, since, he argued, restitution is appreciated only as a mitigating circumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Similarly, the petitioner was found guilty of an administrative charge of Dishonesty and/or Violation of Auditing Regulations on April 25, 1988, regardless of the finding that his accountability had been fully settled.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>On November 28, 1988, the petitioner was charged before the Sandiganbayan of the crime of Malversation of Public Funds.&nbsp; After trial, the respondent court found the petitioner guilty as charged.<br><br>The petitioner basically anchors his defense on the ground that since the audit examination conducted by the COA auditors was attended with irregularities and inaccuracies, the <i>prima facie</i> presumption of malversation could not arise.&nbsp; In addition, since the prosecution was not able to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, the presumption of his innocence must stay.<br><br>The appeal is impressed with merit.<br><br>The conviction of the petitioner by the respondent court was premised on the findings that, in the words of the lower court, "the evidence presented by the accused is insufficient to overcome the presumption that he has put the public funds in his custody to personal use when he failed to produce said funds upon examination on April 7, 1986.&nbsp; Clearly, the fact presumed is but a natural inference from the fact proven."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>However, as we have ruled, <i>en banc</i>, in <i>Tinga v. People,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the prima facie presumption arises only if there is no issue as to the accuracy, correctness, and regularity of the audit findings and if the fact that funds are missing is indubitably established.” <i>Tinga</i> is applicable to the case at bar.<br><br>The inaccuracy, incorrectness, and irregularity of the audit findings are correlative to the unconformable manner in which the audit examination was conducted, as manifested by the following circumstances:<br><br>1. The auditing team did not have a copy of the report of the latest audit prior to the April 7, 1980 audit, which is contrary to a Cash Examination Manual requirement.&nbsp; A copy of the latest Certificate of Settlement and Balance issued to the accountable officer to be examined is necessary to guide the auditing team in its reconciliation of accounts;<br><br>2.&nbsp; Section 560 (d) of the Manual of Instructions to Treasurers and Auditors and Other Guidelines provides:<br><blockquote>"SEC. 560.&nbsp; <i>The procedure and scope of a cash examination and inspection.</i>&nbsp; A cash examination shall embrace the following:<br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

It is the auditing team that is conducting the examination.&nbsp; Apparently, in the team's failure to follow this procedure, various records were inadvertently left out, including certificates of indebtedness which were later credited to the petitioner's account.&nbsp;

Mere count of cash and valid cash items without verifying the stock of issued and unissued accountable forms and various records of collections and disbursements, as well as the entries in the cashbook is not examination at all."</blockquote>From the records of the case, it is evident that the audit examinations lacked the necessary thoroughness and complete­ness the Manual requires.&nbsp; It is highly improbable that an auditing team of four can conduct an audit examination to the last detail in only about twelve (12) hours,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> considering that the total accountability of the petitioner was nearly one (1) million pesos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> and further taking into consideration that the last time the petitioner was audited prior to the April 7, 1986 audit was July, 1985,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> which again is contrary to the once-in-every-3-months-audit requirement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Team leader Adanza even admitted this fact:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
