on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon a "tip" from an informant known only as
Jorge, who reported to P/Lt. Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Abello</span> that <span style="">a </span>certain
alias "Freddie" was in possession of marijuana which was offered to
him (informant), Lt. <span class="SpellE">Abello</span> conducted <span style="">a </span>briefing
for the conduct of the buy-bust operation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P/Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Loriano</span> Morales was to act as the
poseur-buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was provided with three
(3) twenty P20.00 peso bills and two (2) ten P10.00 peso bills, the serial
numbers of which were copied on a piece of paper and recorded in their logbook
by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Santiago (TSN, pp. 3-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the briefing, the team leader, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Abello</span>
and the other members of the team, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Loriano</span> Morales, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
<span class="SpellE">Querubin</span>, Sgt. Jose Domingo, Jorge the informant and
NIS Agent Bobby <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, the driver, boarded the NIS
car and proceeded to the target area at Norton Street, New <span class="SpellE">Kalalake</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once in the area, Morales and Jorge alighted from the car and walked
towards the residence of Freddie at <st1:street><st1:address>113 Norton Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the team positioned themselves at
strategic places away from Freddie's residence (TSN, pp. 5-7).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the door, Jorge knocked and called out for
Freddie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter immediately appeared
at the threshold of said door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jorge
told him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Freddie, <span class="SpellE">itong</span> <span class="SpellE">kaibigan</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">gustong</span> <span class="SpellE">umiskor</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> marijuana." After Freddie ascertained that
Jorge had the money, he handed a plastic bag of marijuana to Morales and the
latter gave him the money amounting to P80.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After receiving the marijuana and handing the money to Freddie, Morales
introduced himself as a <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> agent and arrested
Freddie. Morales immediately executed the pre-arranged signal by scratching his
head, and the back-up team immediately closed in on them (TSN, pp. 25-28). <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Querubin</span> searched
the pocket of the suspect, who was identified as the herein accused, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Rumeral</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buy
bust money was taken from him (TSN, p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The team brought the accused to the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span>
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Querubin</span>
prepared a receipt of the money seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
for his part, prepared the custody/receipt of the marijuana (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "J") bought from the accused and the request
for laboratory examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise
prepared the booking and arrest report which the accused voluntarily signed
(TSN, p. 42).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1987</st1:date>, the PC/INP Crime Laboratory
Service rendered its report finding the specimen positive for marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused had a different version which the lower court did not
believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that on that same
afternoon, he was resting <span style="">in </span>his
room which was also his residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
heard a knock on his door and when he stood up to open <span class="GramE">it,</span>
four (4) men barged in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them
poked a gun at him and ordered his companions to tie him and bring him with
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only other witness presented by the defense was the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> brother <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Rumeral</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>
of that same day, he saw four (4) men in civilian clothes enter his brother's
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">saw them tie </span>his brother with <span style="">a </span>belt and
placed him aboard their jeep.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the judgment of conviction, the accused filed the present
appeal praying for the reversal of the judgment of conviction on two grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

proved; and</p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The appellant's rights to remain silent and to
counsel were violated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">According to accused-appellant, since the
charge was for the selling of marijuana, the elements of sale namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the identity of the buyer and the seller, the
object and consideration; and the delivery of the thing sold and the payment
thereof should be proved with certainty.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These elements accordingly were not proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is allegedly some doubt as regards the
identity of the buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Morales
was instructed to be the poseur-buyer it was not certain that he actually
played that role.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was Jorge who
apparently transacted with the accused-appellant but it was not certain that
the alleged marijuana was given to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other members of the team were allegedly at a distance where it
would be impossible for them to witness who actually handed the money and
received the alleged marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jorge,
the informant, should have been presented to shed light on these matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations of the accused-appellant deserve no
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was clear from the
testimony of Morales, the poseur-buyer that he was the buyer himself who handed
the amount of P80.00 to the seller, who was identified as the
accused-appellant, and that the latter in turn handed him the marijuana
contained in a plastic bag.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">a</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He returned and he was bringing the one

August 17, 1987)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">was </span>not
established with certainty that the other members of the team also witnessed
the transaction between the accused-appellant on the one hand, and Morales and
Jorge on the other, because they concealed themselves at <span style="">a </span>distance of about 20 meters from
the house of the accused-appellant which was located in a <span class="SpellE"><u>looban</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, whatever testimony given by the other
members of the team may be considered hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, their testimonies on the circumstances immediately before the
actual sale and after the consummation of the sale may be received to prove
that the team was at the scene of the crime for the purpose of conducting the
buy-bust operation and for no other purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their testimonies corroborated the testimony of Morales on this aspect.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing repugnant about holding the accused-appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged on the basis of the
testimony of only one person, in this case, Morales, who happened to be the
principal witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span style="">a </span>single
witness if credible and positive and if it satisfies the court that the accused
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt is sufficient to convict (People v. Javier,
G.R. No. 70997, February 28, 1990, 182 SCRA 830).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coming from <span style="">an </span>officer of the law who had no motive for falsely testifying
against the accused-appellant, his testimony, under the circumstances obtaining
in this case, may be received as true.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>, G.R. No. 81520,
February 21, 1989, 170 SCRA 497, We held that (t)he fact that the accused
returned bringing with him the amount of marijuana corresponding to the price
offered by the poseur-buyer suffices to constitute if not sale, then delivery
and distribution of the prohibited drug.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the law proscribes is not only the act of selling but also, albeit
not limited to, the act of delivering (People v. de la Cruz, et al., G.R. No.
83260, April 18, 1990, 184 SCRA 416).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The commission of the offense of illegal sale of marijuana requires
merely the consummation of the selling transaction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Dekingco</span>, G.R. No. 87685, September 13, 1990, 189 SCRA
512).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that the
poseur buyer received the marijuana from the accused (People v. Fernandez, et
al., G.R. No. 80481, June 27, 1990, 186 SCRA 830).</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant also argued that it is hard to believe that
he would transact business with a new face (Morales) when Jorge himself was
hardly known to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v.
Sanchez, G.R. No. 77588, May 12, 1989, 173 SCRA 305, We held that drug pushers,
especially small quantity or retail pushers sell their prohibited wares to
anyone who has the price of the drug, be they strangers or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What matters is not the existing familiarity
between the buyer and the seller but their agreement and acts constituting the
sale and delivery of the marijuana leaves (People v. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>,
G.R. No. 71838, February 26, 1990, 182 SCRA 58; People v. <span class="SpellE">Tejada</span>,
G.R. No. 81520, 21 Feb. 89, 170 SCRA 497).</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the submission of accused-appellant, the testimony or
identity of the informant is not indispensable since his testimony would be
merely corroborative and cumulative (People v. <span class="SpellE">Cerelegia</span>,
G.R. No. 72353, January 30, 1987, 147 SCRA 538), with that of poseur-buyer who
was himself presented and who testified on the details of the <span style="">sale </span>and delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be otherwise if the poseur-buyer
himself was <span style="">also not </span>presented
as in People v. De Luna, G.R. No. 82180, November 8, 1989, 179 SCRA 245, where
We held that "x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>because
the prosecution's case rose and fell on (the poseur-buyer's) testimony, (I<span class="GramE">)t</span> is also doubtless that the rest of the members of the
raiding party's testimonies would have been hearsay in the absence of testimony
given straight from the horse's mouth."</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant was allegedly subjected to all the rituals
of in-custody questioning without the aid of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, all incriminatory facts and
circumstances taken from him in violation of his rights should have been excluded
<span style="">and given scant </span>consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the accused-appellant was caught in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">flagrante</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>His conviction was based on the
testimony of the principal prosecution witness, the poseur-buyer and on the
testimonies of the other members of the team which conducted the buy-bust
operation and not on any piece of evidence taken from or supplied by him while
he was under investigation for the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buy bust money taken from him as an
incident in the arrest may be presented against him in court; so with the stuff
bought from him which was found positive <span style="">for
</span>marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is convinced that <span style="">the
guilt </span>of accused-appellant had been proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buy-bust operation conducted by the
NARCOM agents to catch the accused-appellant was an entrapment allowed by
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law enforcers are presumed to
have performed their duties regularly in the absence of proof to the contrary
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Wapat</span>-a, G.R. No. 84951, November 14,
1989, 179 SCRA 403).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appeal<span style="">ed from </span>is AFFIRMED.</p>
