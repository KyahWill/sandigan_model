Airlines, Inc., liable in damages for breach of contract.</span><u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 25 November 1976,
private respondent filed a complaint for damages for breach of contract of
carriage</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> against Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL),
before the then Court of First Instance, now Regional Trial Court, of Misamis
Occidental, at Ozamiz City.  According
to him, on 2 August 1976, he was among the twenty-one (21) passengers of PAL
Flight 477 that took off from Cebu bound for Ozamiz City.  The routing of this flight was
Cebu-Ozamiz-Cotabato.  While on flight
and just about fifteen (15) minutes before landing at Ozamiz City, the pilot
received a radio message that the airport was closed due to heavy rains and
inclement weather and that he should proceed to Cotabato City instead.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon arrival at Cotabato
City, the PAL Station Agent informed the passengers of their options to return
to Cebu on Flight 560 of the same day and thence </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">Ozamiz City on 4
August 1975, or take the next flight to Cebu the following day, </span><span style="">or remain at Cotabato and take the next

<span style="">for </span>Manila; and, <span style="">that the basis for priority </span>would be
the check-in sequence <span style="">at Cebu.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent chose
to return to Cebu but was not accommodated because he checked-in as passenger
No. 9 on Flight 477.  He insisted on
being given priority over the confirmed passengers in the accommodation, but
the </span><span style="">Station </span><span style="">Agent refused private respondent’s demand
explaining that the latter's predicament was not due to PAL's own doing but to
a force majeure.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent tried
to stop the departure of Flight 560 as his personal belongings, including a
package containing a camera which a certain Miwa from Japan asked him to
deliver to Mrs. Fe Obid of Gingoog City, were still on board.  His plea fell on deaf ears.  PAL then issued to private respondent a free
ticket to Iligan City, which the latter received under protest.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Private respondent was left at the airport

transportation from the airport to the city proper nor food and accommodation
for his stay in Cotabato City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The following day,
private respondent purchased a PAL ticket to Iligan City.  He informed PAL personnel that </span><span style="">he would not use the free ticket because he
was filing a case against PAL.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In Iligan </span><span style="">City, private respondent hired a car </span>from the airport to

seat for private respondent on Flight 560 since there were only six (6) seats
available and the priority of accommodation on Flight 560 was based on the
check-in sequence in Cebu; that the first six (6) priority passengers on Flight
477 chose to take Flight 560; that its Station Agent explained in a courteous
and polite manner to all passengers the reason for PAL's inability to transport
all of them back to Cebu; that the stranded passengers agreed to avail of the
options and had </span>their respective tickets exchanged for their onward
trips; that it was only the private respondent who insisted on being given
priority in the accommodation; that pieces of checked-in baggage and
handcarried items of the Ozamiz City passengers were removed from the aircraft;
that the reason for the pilot's inability to land at Ozamiz City airport was
because the runway was wet due to rains thus posing a threat to the safety of
both passengers and aircraft; and, that such reason of force majeure was a
valid justification for the pilot to bypass Ozamiz City and proceed directly to
Cotabato City.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

only a modification of its disposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In its petition, PAL
vigorously maintains that private respondent's principal cause of action was
its alleged denial of private respondent's demand for priority over the
confirmed passengers on Flight 560.  Likewise, PAL points out that the complaint did not impute to PAL
neglect in failing to attend to the needs of the diverted passengers; and, that
the question of negligence was not and never put in issue by </span>the <span style="">pleadings or proved at the trial.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Contrary to the above
arguments, private respondent's amended complaint touched on PAL's indifference

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Significantly, PAL did
not seem to mind the introduction of evidence which focused on its alleged
negligence in caring for its stranded passengers.  Well-settled is the rule in evidence that the protest or
objection against the admission of evidence should be presented at the time the
evidence is offered, and that the proper time to make protest or objection to
the admissibility of evidence is when the question is presented to the witness
or at the time the answer thereto is given.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There being no objection, such evidence

<p class="BODY">With regard to the award of damages affirmed by the appellate
court, PAL argues that the same is unfounded.  It asserts that it should not be charged with the task of looking after
the passengers' comfort and convenience because the diversion of the flight was
due to a fortuitous event, and that if made liable, an added burden is given to
PAL which is over and beyond its duties under the contract of carriage.  It submits that granting <i style="">arguendo</i><span style=""> </span>that negligence exists, PAL cannot be liable in damages in the
absence of fraud or bad faith; that private respondent failed to apprise PAL of
the nature of his trip and possible business losses; and, that private
respondent himself is to be blamed for unreasonably refusing to use the free
ticket which PAL issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contract of air carriage is a peculiar one.  Being imbued with public interest, the law
requires common carriers to carry the passengers safely as far as human care and
foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of very cautious persons,
with due regard for all the circumstances.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> In <i style="">Air </i><i style=""><span style="">France v.

<blockquote>“A contract to transport passengers is quite different in kind and
degree from any other contractual relation.  And this, because of the relation which an air carrier sustains with the
public.  Its business is mainly with the
travelling public.  <u>It invites people
to avail of the comforts and advantages it offers</u>.  The contract of air carriage, therefore,
generates a relation attended with a public duty x x x x" (underlining
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The position taken by PAL
in this case clearly illustrates </span><span style="">its
</span><span style="">failure to grasp the exacting
standard required by law.  Undisputably,
PAL'S diversion of its flight due to inclement weather was a fortuitous
event.  Nonetheless, such occurrence did
not terminate PAL's contract with its passengers.  Being in the business of air carriage and the sole one to operate
in the country, PAL is deemed equipped to deal with situations as in the case
at bar.  What we said in one case once
again must be stressed, i.e., the relation of carrier and passenger continues
until the latter has been landed at the port of destination and has left the
carrier's premises.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, PAL necessarily would still have to
exercise extraordinary diligence in safeguarding the comfort, convenience and
safety of its stranded passengers until they have reached their final
destination.  On this score, PAL grossly
failed considering the then ongoing battle between government forces and Muslim
rebels in Cotabato City and the fact that the private respondent was a stranger
to the place.  As the appellate court
correctly ruled -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While the failure of plaintiff in the first instance to reach
his destination at Ozamis City <span style="">in </span>accordance
with the contract of carriage was <span style="">due
to the closure of the airport on account of rain and inclement weather which
was radioed to defendant 15 minutes before landing, it has not been disputed by
defendant airline that Ozamis City has no all-weather airport and has to cancel
its flight to Ozamis City or by-pass it in the event of inclement weather.  Knowing this fact, it becomes the duty of
defendant to provide all means of comfort and convenience to its passengers
when they would have to be left in a strange place in case of such
by-passing.  The steps taken by
defendant airline company towards this end has not been put in evidence,
especially for those 7 others who were not accommodated in the return trip to
Cebu, only 6 of the 21 having been so accommodated.  It appears that plaintiff had to leave on the next </span><span style="">flight 2 </span><span style="">days later.  If the cause of
non-fulfillment of the contract is due to a fortuitous event, it has to be the sole
and only cause (Art. 1755 C.C., Art. 1733 C.C.) Since part of the failure to
comply with the obligation of common carrier to deliver its passengers safely
to their destination lay in the defendant’s failure to provide comfort and
convenience to its stranded passengers using extra-ordinary diligence, the
cause of non-fulfillment is not solely and exclusively due to fortuitous event,
but due to something which defendant airline could have prevented, defendant
becomes liable to plaintiff.</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While we find PAL remiss

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, private respondent's insistence on being given priority
in accommodation was unreasonable considering the fortuitous event and that
there was a sequence to be <span style="">observed in
the booking, i.e., in the order the passengers checked-in at their port of
origin.  His intransigence in fact was
the main </span>cause for his having to stay at the <span style="">airport longer than was necessary -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said that there were no other people left there at that time, is that correct?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the plaint that PAL
employees were disrespectful and inattentive toward private respondent, the
records are bereft of evidence to support the same.  Thus, the ruling of respondent Court of Appeals in this regard is
without basis.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">On

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of these
findings, we find the award of moral damages of Fifty Thousand Pesos

Pesos (P10,000.00).  Conformably
herewith, the award of exemplary damages is also reduced to Five Thousand Pesos
(P5,000.00).  Moral damages are not
intended to enrich the private respondent.  They are awarded only to enable the injured party to obtain means,
diversion or amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he has
undergone by reason of the defendant's culpable action.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the award of actual damages in the amount of
P5,000.00 representing private <span style="color: windowtext;">respondent’s</span>
alleged business losses occasioned by his stay at Cotabato City, we find the
same unwarranted.  Private respondent's
testimony that he had a scheduled business "transaction of shark liver oil
supposedly to have been consummated on August 3, 1975 in the morning" and
that "since (private respondent) was out for nearly two weeks I missed to
buy about 10 barrels of shark liver oil,"<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> are
purely speculative.  Actual or
compensatory damages cannot be presumed but must be duly proved with reasonable
degree of <span style="">certainty.  A court cannot rely on speculation,
conjecture or guesswork as to the fact and amount of damages, but must depend
upon competent proof that they have suffered and on evidence of the actual amount
thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b> the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED with
