the Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> dated <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1986</st1:date>, affirming with modification, the
decision of the Regional Trial Court, National Capital Region, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Branch </span>XXVII, and the resolution dated
<st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1987</st1:date> denying the
motion for reconsideration filed thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of this case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1979, the private respondent, as owner of the
building consisting of 14 doors, filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
against petitioner Bella S. D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> in the then City
Court of Manila, alleging that the latter failed to pay her monthly rental of
P150.00 from Septem­ber 5, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 19, 1979, the petitioner filed her<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">answer
denying the material allegations stated in the complaint and by way of
affirmative allegations alleged, among others, that sometime in the early part
of 1961 the private </span>respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">entered
into a verbal contract of lease with the petitioner covering one (1) door
(down) of the building otherwise known as No. 1782-B Alvarez Street, Sta. Cruz,
Manila, owned by the private respondent, at the agreed monthly rental of
P60.00, which was subse­quently increased </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">P65.00, then to P70.00 and finally to P80.00 rental a month; that
sometime in the first week of September 1978, the petitioner tendered to pri­vate
respondent's collector the sum </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P80.00
</span>by way <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of payment of the rental
for the month of September, 1978, but the latter refused to accept the same
claiming that the monthly rental has already been increased to P150.00 a month;
that all the proffered payments made by the petitioner for the months of October
1978, Novem­ber 1978, December 1978, January 1979, February 1979, March 1979,
April 1979 and May 1979 were refused by the private respondent's collector
based on the same<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> ground that the sum
of P80.00 </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">payment for the
monthly rental cannot be accepted because the same was already increased to
P150.00 a month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1980</st1:date>,
the City Court of Manila rendered a decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">**</span></span></a> in favor of the private respondent

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, plaintiff having satisfactorily established his case
for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering the defendant and all persons claiming under her to vacate door No.
1782-B located at Alvarez Street, Sta. Cruz, Manila, subject of this action, and
restore immediately possession thereof to the plaintiff, and to pay the
latter:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) The sum of P560.00

the filing of the complaint until fully paid; (3) the sum of P300.00 a month,
from October 6, 1979 and every month thereafter until said premises are
actually vacated and possession thereof restored to plain­tiff, as reasonable
compensation for the continued unlawful occupation and use of said premises; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(4) </span>the sum
of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees; and (5) the costs of the suit.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 38-39)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">Petition </span>for Review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1986</st1:date>,
the appellate court rendered a decision affirming with modification the judgment
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the
Regional Trial Court, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, We find no merit in the petition for review.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We modify, however, the decision by eliminating the part
thereof ordering the petitioners to pay P560 to the private respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The decision is affirmed in all other respects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Costs against the petitioners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 52-53)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, the
petitioners filed the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the memoranda submitted by the parties, it is clear that the
main issue in this case is whether or not the petitioner incurred a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:26.0pt">r</span>rears in payment of rent which fault
is one of the grounds for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioners that PD No. 20, the law
applicable when the private respondent increased the monthly rental of the
premises from P80.00 to P150.00 in April 1978, prohibits the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of a dwelling unit to increase the monthly rental
agreed upon between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee as of
the <span class="SpellE">effect­ivity</span> of the Act when said monthly rental
does not exceed three hundred (300.00) pesos and the unilateral act of
increasing the rent already constitutes <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>violation thereof and it is no longer relevant whether the tenant agrees
or objects to the increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further argued by the petitioners that the right of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to eject a lessee upon the termination of the lease
in accordance with Art. 1687 of the Civil Code has been suspended by the
express mandate of Section 4 of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, hence,
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of a lessee may not be judicially
decreed on the ground alone that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> had given
the lessee notice or demand to vacate to render the lessee liable for eviction
under Art. 1673 (1) of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 124-126)</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the petitioners stress that their refusal to pay the
increased rental of P150.00 a month from <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1978</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1979</st1:date>
cannot be considered as a valid ground for ejecting them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners offered to pay in cash the
stipulated rental of P80 a month but this offer was rejected because the
private respondent wanted them to pay the increased rental of P150.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the lawyers of the private respondent
demanded the payment of the stipulated rental of P80 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">a month from </span><st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">September 5, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> to </span><st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">May 4, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, the peti­tioners immediately paid the same
in check for P800 which payment was received as the check was <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> by the private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of rental by private
respondent converts the petitioners' possession of the premises from illegal to
legal, assuming, that their possession of the premises had become illegal in
the meantime for alleged non-payment of rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the private respondent again refused to
accept the proffered rental payment at the old rate of P80 a month, petitioner
Bella S.D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> had to resort to the expediency of
depositing the money covering the stipulated rentals with the Far East Bank and
Trust Company includ­ing interest as of January 7, 1984, as evidenced by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">passbook No. 5322,
with notice to private respondent by registered mail which was received by the
private respondent on November 22, 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 129)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondent maintains that
petitioner Bella S.D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was in arrears in the
payment of her rental of P150.00 from September 5, 1978 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to May 4, 1979, as evidenced by a check in
the amount of P800.00 issued by her brother-in-law as payment for her rental
for ten (10) months which was still incomplete if the new monthly rate is to be
included, hence, her <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> from the premises is
proper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also argued by the private respondent that the oral lease
from month to month was for a definite period and Presidential Decree No. 20
did not apply as ruled by this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Rantael</u></span><u>
vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 97 SCRA 453, and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bulacanag</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> vs. Francisco</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>122 SCRA 498.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
114-115)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Court of Manila found that the petitioner was eight (8)
months in arrears (September 5, 1978 to May 4, 1979) in the total amount of
P800.00 when the private respondent's lawyer demanded on <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1979</st1:date>, that the petitioner vacate the
leased premises and pay<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> her rent in arrears for said period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Regional Trial Court of Manila and the Court of Appeals have similar
findings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One of the grounds for judicial <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, Section 5 (b), is -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Arrears in payment of rent for three (3) months at any one
time:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That in case of refusal
by the <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span> to accept payment of the rental agreed
upon, the lessee shall either deposit, by way of consignation, the amount<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> in court, or in a
bank in the name of and with notice to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be denied that the petitioner in this case incurred
arrears in payment of rentals for eight (8) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If private respondent's collector refused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to accept the
proffered payments, as claimed by her, she should have deposited the amount, by
way of consigna­tion, in court, or in a bank in the name of and with notice to
the private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that since there is no fixed term for the
duration of the lease and the rent agreed upon is paid monthly, the expiration
thereof is governed by Art. 1687 of the Civil Code which has been suspended by
express mandate of Section 4 of PD No. 20 and Section 6 of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rental
being payable monthly, the lease is one without <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>definite period, hence the Rental Laws (not Art. 1687 of the
Civil Code) apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that the new rentals demanded since 1979
(P150.00 per month) exceed that allowed by law so refusal on the part of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to accept was justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, what the lessee should have done was
to deposit in 1979 the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">previous</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>rent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This deposit<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the
Bank </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was
made only in 1984 indicating a delay of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing facts, it is clear that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> was correct in asking for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of the delinquent lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he
should be granted not only the current <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">rentals
</span>but also all the rentals in arrears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is so even if the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> himself did not
appeal because as ruled by this Court, there have been instances when
substantial justice demands the giving of the proper <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Anuncia­cion</span> del
