Pursuant to the resolution of the Court En Banc dated March 12, 1981, 
and on the basis of the letter dated February 15, 1982 of Presiding 
Justice Manuel R. Pamaran, Sandiganbayan, informing this Court of the 
filing of a Criminal Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  against Danilo Reyes, Deputy Sheriff of the Court of First Instance of
 Rizal, Branch XXI, Pasig, the Court Administrator charges respondent 
Reyes with Serious Misconduct for his failure to comply with the lower 
court's order to set the auction sale of the levied properties of one 
Romeo B. Castillo, defendant in Civil Case No. 31497, entitled, "Mila O.
 Tiongson vs. Romeo B. Castillo," for a Sum of Money With Prayer for a 
Writ of Preliminary Attachment.
<p>
Respondent in his comment, states that his noncompliance with the 
court's order was due to the fact that he had already returned the 
levied properties to the defendant for he believed that he overlevied 
upon defendant's properties and that he arrived at this conclusion when 
plaintiff's counsel told him that the Toyota Tamaraw was more than 
enough to satisfy the judgment debt.  Another reason advanced by 
respondent for releasing the properties in custody was that plaintiff 
reneged on his promise to pay the storage fee in the bodega of a nearby 
restaurant since the Sheriff's Office has no bodega where he could keep 
the levied properties safely.
</p><p>
Acting Executive Judge Rizalina Bonifacio Vera, who investigated the incident, submits<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  that she finds no evidence to sustain the Administrative Charge 
against respondent as the latter would not have been able to comply with
 the Court's Order of July 10, 1981 because the properties levied upon 
were already released to defendant after a little over a week from the 
date of the levy on June 3, 1981.  Judge Vera further averred that the 
act of respondent cannot possibly constitute serious misconduct as 
provided for by law specially in the light of the contention of 
respondent that the release of the properties was on account of the 
advice of Atty. Domingo, counsel for plaintiff Tiongson, who could have 
denied the claim of respondent but chose not to refute the same; and 
that the execution of plaintiff of an affidavit of desistance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  on October 20, 1981 militates against finding respondent guilty of 
serious misconduct.  The dismissal of the charge against Reyes was 
recommended by the Investigator.
</p><p>
Acting Court Administrator Arturo Buena agrees with the findings and 
recommendation of Judge Vera and in addition, he recommends that the 
payment of respondent's back salaries from the time he was suspended <em>pendente lite</em> by the Sandiganbayan on June 2, 1982 up to and during the pendency of this case, be authorized.
</p><p>
However, respondent acted improperly in releasing the properties to 
defendant without asking permission from the court, considering there 
was no undue injury caused to plaintiff, and that there was no 
unwarranted benefit of advantage given to defendant, such actuation by 
itself cannot possibly constitute serious misconduct since he appeared 
to have done the same not in bad faith.  The report and recommendation 
of Judge Vera is too lenient.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the respondent Danilo G. Reyes deserves a warning, as he is
 hereby warned to be more prudent in the discharge of his duties.  
However his back salaries during the period of his suspension may be 
authorized, since he was acquitted by the Sandiganbayan which ordered 
his suspension.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
