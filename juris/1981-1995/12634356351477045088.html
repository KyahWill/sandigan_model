				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Social Security System (SSS) filed a petition for remittance
of social security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">contributions </span>with
the Social Security Commission (SSC) against private respondent Machine Tools
Manufacturing Company, Phils.</p>

<p class="BODY">An investigation was conducted by Field Representative Artemio M.
Banta, who submitted a report dated January 6, 1986, finding the respondent
liable in the sum of P308,277.67.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After reinvestigation of the case at the request of the
respondent, a Field Assessment Report and Memorandum both dated July 23, 1986,
were submitted by Banta reducing the liability of the respondent to P13,270.90.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent thereupon filed a motion to dismiss the
petition and attached as annexes the said Field Assessment Report and SSS
receipts to prove full payment of its indebtedness.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1986, the SSC dismissed the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration within the reglementary
period.  The SSC granted the motion in
an order dated December 11, 1986, and directed the parties to present further
evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the SSC issued an order on March 9, 1989, finding
the private respondent liable to the petitioner in the amount of P308,277.67,
representing unremitted premium contributions in behalf of its employees from
January 1978 to December 1979, plus the penalties thereon for late payment in
the amount of P1,121,301.49 computed as of March 1989.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration was denied on February 7, 1990.  The private respondent then went to the
Court of Appeals, arguing that the SSC erred in granting the motion for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reconsideration of the SSS and in reopening
the case.  It </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cited Sec. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">23, Rule X of the Social Security Commission, Hearing Procedure and
Review, reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 23. Finality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>decision
or awards. - An order or decision of the Commission shall become final after
the expiration of the period within which to appeal, without such appeal having
been filed.  However, if the order,
award or judgment of the Commission in the case is adverse to or against the
SSS or in favor of the other party whether the latter is a petitioner or
respondent, said order, award or judgment shall become immediately final and
executory. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(Now Sec. </span>6, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rule </span>VI, Rules on Pleading, Practice
and Procedure of the Social Security Commission).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the decision here challenged,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> the
Court of Appeals agreed with the private respondent, thus:</p>

<blockquote>The Order of Dismissal dated October 16, 1986 issued by the
Commission in this case was an order adverse to or against the petitioner
SSS.  There can be no question, then,
that the Order of Dismissal became final and executory.  The word "shall" does not make the
finality of the Order of Dismissal discretionary on the Commission or
contingent upon some event or proceeding.  The word "shall" has been consistently held to mean that the
finality of the order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is </span>mandatory, leaving no room for interpretation or delay.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the resolution of the SSC dated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">March </span>9, 1989, was declared null and
void and set aside, and the order of dismissal dated October 16, 1986, was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reinstated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the SSS was not allowed to appeal against the
decision of the SSC not only under the above-quoted Sec. 23 but also under Sec.
1 Rule VII, Rules on Pleading, Practice and Procedure of the Commission, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Sec. 1. </span>Appeal. -
Any decision of the Commission, in the absence of an appeal therefrom as herein
provided, shall become final fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of
notification to the parties and judicial review thereof shall be permitted only
after any party claiming to be aggrieved thereby has exhausted his remedies
before the Commission.  The filing of
the motion for reconsideration by any party suspends the running of the period
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">appeal.  A party may appeal to the Court of Appeals, on question of fact,
or both on questions of fact and law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If the decision of the Commission involves only questions of law,
the same shall be reviewed by the Supreme Court.  In either appeal, no appeal bond shall be required.  If no appeal is perfected within the periods
hereinabove fixed, the order, award, decision or resolution of the Commission
shall become final and may be executed as provided herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">In all appeals, the
Commission shall be made a party respondent or appellee and shall be
represented by an attorney retained or employed by the Commission either alone
or in collaboration with the solicitor general's office; provided that, no
appeal shall be brought by the SSS against the decision of the Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the SSS was not left without a remedy, as it could
have filed - as in fact it did - a motion for reconsideration with the SSC
(which was granted).  The filing of such
motion was allowed under Sec. 22, Rule X, SSC, Hearing Procedure and Review, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Sec.
</span>22. Motion for Reconsideration.  <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The party aggrieved</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by
the order, award, or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">resolution
of the Commission may file a motion for reconsideration thereof within fifteen
(15) calendar days from receipt of the same.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The filing of the motion for reconsideration shall interrupt the
running of the period to appeal, unless said motion is pro-forma.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The party interested in upholding the order, award, resolution or
decision of the Commission may file his opposition to the motion for
reconsideration at any time before the resolution thereof, provided, that not
more than one motion for reconsideration shall be allowed <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">any </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">party</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> </span>(Emphasis
supplied; Now Sec. 5, Rule VI, Rules on Pleading Practice and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> Procedure of the SSC).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that in its appeal to the respondent court, the
private respondent complained that the amount of its liability was
statistically improbable.  This issue
was not passed upon in the challenged decision, which merely declared that the
reopening of the case before the SSC was not authorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">The SSC found that as early as January 6, 1986, the SSS Regional
Office No. 03 had already determined that the sum of P308,277.67 should be
collected from the private respondent.  The controversial reduction of the amount to P13,270.90 was disallowed
because it was based on a study only of the documents submitted by respondent,
namely, the daily and monthly payrolls from January 1978 to December 1979, SSS
Form R-3s (Collection Lists), R-5s (Payment Returns) and Income Statements for
the same period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Banta testified that in order to justify such reduction, it was
also necessary to scrutinize the book of accounts and ledgers of Machine
Tools.  However, the private respondent
failed to submit these documents for examination, prompting him to make a
revised report on October 15, 1986, recommending the collection of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">original assessment of P308,277.67.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of such documents, the assessment had to be based
on the records of the SSS as reported by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
</span>employer company itself.  Under
Section 24 (c) of the Social Security Law, these records shall be presumed
correct as to the data and other matters stated therein unless the necessary
corrections have been properly made by the parties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">concerned.  </span>The SSC found
that no such corrections had been made by the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The findings of fact of
quasi-judicial agencies which have acquired expertise on the specific matters
entrusted to their jurisdiction are accorded by this Court not only respect but
even finality if they are supported by substantial evidence.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">findings of the SSC in
its March 9, 1989, resolution have not been validly challenged and so must be
sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is GRANTED.  The decision the Court of Appeals dated
March 11, 1992, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The resolution dated March 9, 1989 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">order dated February 7, 1990 of
the SSC in SCC Case No. 10016 are hereby AFFIRMED and REINSTATED.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
