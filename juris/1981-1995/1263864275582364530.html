				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In an <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> letter-complaint dated 14
April 1988 addressed to then Mr. Chief Justice Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
complainant <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Delizo</span>
charged her husband, Atty. Laurence D. Cordova, with immorality and acts
unbecoming a member of the Bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
letter-complaint was forwarded by the Court to the Integrated Bar of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Commission on Bar Discipline ("Commission”), for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission, before acting on the complaint, required
complainant to submit a verified complaint within ten (10) days from
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant complied and
submitted to the Commission on 27 September 1988 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a</span> revised and verified version of her long and detailed
complaint against her husband charging him with immorality and acts unbecoming
a member of the Bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order of the Commission dated <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="12">1 December 1988</st1:date>, respondent was declared in default for
failure to file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>answer to the
complaint within fifteen (15) days from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same Order required complainant to submit before the Commission her
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">parte</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>on <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="12">16 December 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the telegraphic request of complainant for the resetting of the <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="12">16 December 1988</st1:date> hearing, the
Commission scheduled another hearing on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="1">25
 January 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearing
scheduled for <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="1">25 January 1989</st1:date>
was rescheduled two (2) more times ­-- first, for <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="2">25 February 1989</st1:date> and second, for 10 and <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="4">11 April 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hearings never took place as complainant
failed to appear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Cordova
never moved to set aside the order of default, even though notices of the
hearings scheduled were sent to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a telegraphic message dated <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="4">6 April <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1989</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>complainant informed the Commission
that she and her husband had already "reconciled." In an order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="4">17 April 1989</st1:date>, the Commission
required the parties (respondent and complainant) to appear before it for
confirmation and explanation of the telegraphic message and required them to
file a formal motion to dismiss the complaint within fifteen (15) days from
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Neither party
responded and</span> nothing was heard from either party since then.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant having failed to submit her evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> before the Commission, the IBP Board of
Governors submitted to this Court its report reprimanding respondent for his
acts, admonishing him that any further acts of immorality in the future will be
dealt with more severely, and ordering him to support his legitimate family as
a responsible parent should.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the IBP Board of Governors may be summed up as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant and respondent Cordova were married on <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="6">6 June 1976</st1:date> and out of this marriage,
two (2) children were born.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1985, the
couple lived somewhere in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that year, respondent Cordova left his
family as well as his job as Branch Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cabarroguis</span>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and went to <span class="SpellE">Mangagoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> with one <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fely</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> was herself
married and left her own husband and children to stay with respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Cordova and <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> lived together in <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>
as husband and wife, with respondent Cordova introducing <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>
to the public as his wife, and <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> using the name <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>
Cordova.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Cordova gave <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> funds with which to
establish a sari-sari store in the public market at <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>,
while at the same time failing to support his legitimate family.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="4">6 April 1986</st1:date>,
respondent Cordova and his complainant wife had an apparent
reconciliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent promised that
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>would separate from <span class="SpellE">Fely</span> <span class="SpellE">Holgado</span> and brought his
legitimate family to <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bislig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span><span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent would, however, frequently come home
from beerhouses or cabarets, drunk, and continued to neglect the support of his
legitimate family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In February 1987,
complainant found, upon returning from a trip to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
necessitated by hospitalization of her daughter Loraine, that respondent Cordova
was no longer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">living </span>with her
(complainant's) children <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>their
conjugal home:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that respondent Cordova <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>living with another mistress, one <span class="SpellE">Luisita</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, and had taken
his younger daughter Melanie along with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent and his new mistress hid Melanie from the complainant,
compelling complainant to go to court and to take back her daughter by <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">habeas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><u>corpus</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Regional Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, gave her custody of
their children.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding respondent's promises to reform, he continued to
live with <span class="SpellE">Luisita</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">her </span>husband and continued to
fail to give support to his legitimate family.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Commission received a telegram message apparently
from complainant, stating that complainant and respondent had been reconciled
with each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the record, we agree with the findings of fact
of the IBP Board.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We </span>also agree that the most recent
reconciliation between complainant and respondent, assuming the same to be
real, does not excuse and wipe away the misconduct and immoral <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span> of the respondent carried out in public, and
necessarily adversely reflecting upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">him
as </span>a member of the Bar and upon the Philippine Bar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>An applicant for admission to membership in the bar is required
to show that he is possessed of good moral character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That requirement is not exhausted and
dispensed with upon admission to membership of the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">requirement </span>persists
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>a continuing condition for
membership in the Bar in good standing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Mortel</u></span><u> </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Aspiras</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this </span>Court, following the rule
in the United States, held that "the continued possession x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of a good moral character is
a requisite condition for the rightful continuance in the practice of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">law </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and its loss requires suspension or disbarment, even
though the statutes do not specify that as a ground for disbarment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">It </span>is important to note that the
lack of moral character that we here refer to as essential is not limited to
good moral character relating to the discharge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>the duties and responsibilities of an attorney at law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The moral delinquency that affects the
fitness of a member of the bar to continue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">as </span>such includes conduct that outrages the generally accepted
moral standards of the community, conduct for instance, which makes "a mockery
at the inviolable social institution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
</span>marriage."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In <span class="SpellE"><u>Mortel</u></span>, the respondent being already
married, wooed and won the heart <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of a </span>single,
21-year old teacher who subsequently cohabited with him and bore him a
son.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="SpellE">responden't's</span>
conduct in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mortel</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>was particularly morally repulsive,
involving the marrying of his mistress to his own son and thereafter cohabiting
with the wife of his own son after the marriage he had himself arranged,
respondent was disbarred.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Royong</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> v. <span class="SpellE">Oblena</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>the respondent was declared unfit to
continue as a member of the bar by reason of his immoral conduct and
accordingly disbarred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was found to
have engaged in sexual relations with the complainant who consequently bore him
a son:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and to have maintained for a number
of years an adulterous relationship with another woman.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, respondent Cordova maintained for about two
(2) years an adulterous relationship with a married woman not his wife, in full
view of the general public, to the humiliation and detriment of his legitimate
family which he, rubbing salt on the wound, failed or refused to support.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a brief period of "reform",
respondent took up again with another woman not his wife, cohabiting with her,
and bringing along his young daughter to live with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, respondent flaunted his disregard of
the fundamental institution of marriage and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">its </span>elementary obligations before his own daughter and the
community at large.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court Resolved to SUSPEND respondent from
the practice of law indefinitely and until further orders from this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court will consider lifting his
suspension when respondent Cordova submits proof satisfactory to the Commission
and this Court that he has and continues to provide for the support of his legitimate
family and that he has given up the immoral course of conduct that he has clung
to.</p>
