				<BR><STRONG>CORTES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner was in the employ of private respondent for almost
seventeen (17) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted a
letter of resignation on <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of his resignation, he was
holding the position of Assistant General Manager for Operations and was the
second highest official of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had a monthly salary of Ten Thousand Seven Hundred Pesos (P10<span class="GramE">,700.00</span>), monthly allowance of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00),
monthly housing allowance of Four Hundred Pesos (P400.00), Christmas bonus of
one month salary and a milling bonus of not less than Fifty Thousand Pesos
(P50,000.00), <span style="">plus </span>other company
benefits, for a total of not less than <span style="">Two
</span>Hundred Thousand Pesos (P200,000.00) annually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He exercised general supervision and control
over all departments connected with mill operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1981, the private respondent, through its board of directors,
decided to purchase a boiler, the cost of which would amount to several million
pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An evaluation committee was
constituted with petitioner as chairman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Quotations and proposals were received by the committee.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span>dispute arose
between petitioner and the general manager regarding the committee's
recommendations, particularly, the brand of boiler recommended, leading to
charges and counter-charges of kickbacks or commissions given to officers and
directors by the suppliers, which culminated in petitioner's letter of
resignation dated May 5, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That this
matter led to petitioner's resignation is certain, although no mention of it is
made in the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The material portion
of the letter stated, â€œ. . . I am taking a much needed vacation for a period of
one (1) month starting <span style="">May </span>7th
and subsequently resigning irrevocably after serving the required 30-day notice
and turning over period right after my vacation." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 59.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter was submitted to the board of directors, but the
board, in its meeting on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1981</st1:date>
deferred action on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span style="">was </span>summoned
by the board and in the meeting of <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1981</st1:date> he explained why he filed his resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in the minutes of the meeting,
"[h]e manifested his intention to withdraw his letter of resignation and
he promised to send a letter to that effect." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 63.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then went on vacation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the board's meeting of <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="5">May
 30, 1981</st1:date>, petitioner's letter of resignation was again
discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes stated:</p>

<blockquote>C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter of resignation
submitted by Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> is irrevocable and
according to our lawyer who was present, Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>
is considered resigned as soon as the board takes cognizance of his irrevocable
letter of resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> pointed out that the resignation was made under
pressure and the resignation was not voluntary, and therefore not valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>
expressed his intention to withdraw his letter of resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The president reported that no letter of
withdrawal has been received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In as much
as the Board believed that it had no choice on the matter it did not take any
action on the resignation except to take cognizance of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Annex "G", p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 64.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="6">June 3,
 1981</st1:date>, Fernando <span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span>, the general
manager, directed petitioner "to desist and refrain from further assuming
and usurping the functions of the said position after your vacation, if ever
any such intention exists in your mind." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 66.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner replied in a letter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1981</st1:date>, stating that he had already withdrawn his
resignation and that he was returning to work [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 67-68.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1981</st1:date>,
petitioner reported back to work.</p>

informed the suppliers of private respondent that petitioner was no longer
connected with the cooperative and that any transaction entered into by
petitioner on said date or thereafter shall be considered null and void [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 73.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1981</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against private respondent
and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span></st1:place></st1:city>
before the regional office of the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was docketed as LRD Case No. <span class="GramE">SI-8453-81.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meeting of the board of directors on <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1981</st1:date>, the matter was discussed
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes stated:</p>

<blockquote>The minutes of <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13,
 1981</st1:date> were presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> stated that when asked whether he was resigning or
not, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> answered, "No, I am
withdrawing my letter of resignation." Mr. <span class="SpellE">Claparols</span>,
Mr. Flores, Mr. Villanueva and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> all said
that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> said that he was sending a letter
to withdraw his resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> said that the letter to be sent was a request for
leave of absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minutes of <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1981</st1:date> were approved as

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1981</st1:date>,
private respondent reported petitioner's resignation to the district office of
the MOLE.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The officer who investigated LRD Case No.</span>
SI-8453-81 recommended petitioner's reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
but Assistant Regional Director Dante <span class="SpellE">Ardivilla</span>
issued on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1981</st1:date>
an order dismissing the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Minister, but Deputy Minister Vicente <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr. affirmed the order on <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1982</st1:date> and denied the motion for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, the instant
petition was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court dismissed the petition for lack of merit on <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But upon deliberation on petitioner's motion
for reconsideration, private respondent's comment opposing it, the Solicitor
General's comment supporting petitioner's position, petitioner's reply and
private respondent's reply to the Solicitor General's comment, the Court on
July 2, 1984 reconsidered the dismissal of the petition and gave it due
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the parties filed
their memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was dormant for several years despite several motions
for early resolution filed by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only after the Court was reorganized that the case was finally
considered submitted for deliberation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court required the parties to move in the premises and manifest whether
supervening events have rendered the case moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties replied in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we proceed with the disposition of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy revolves around petitioner's resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed the resignation never took effect,
then petitioner should be allowed to return to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Naturally, petitioner claims that he had effectively withdrawn
his resignation when he appeared before the board of directors on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1981</st1:date> and verbally manifested
his withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is supported by the
Solicitor General in this position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
stated by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>Not only did petitioner withdraw his resignation in the Board
meeting of <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1981</st1:date>, he
also performed acts of omission and commission repudiating the letter of
resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, he did not serve
the required 30-day notice mentioned in his letter of resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, he reported back for work on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1981</st1:date>, at the end of his
vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1981</st1:date>, he filed a complaint
for illegal lay-off or dismissal against respondent-cooperative and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 152.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent contends that since his
resignation letter used the word "irrevocable," his resignation need
not be accepted by private respondent and could no longer be withdrawn by
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts and circumstances support the conclusion
that petitioner's resignation never became effective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite its being termed
"irrevocable," neither the petitioner nor the private respondent
treated it as such, as shown by the minutes of the <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1981</st1:date> board meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was summoned before the board of
directors to explain why he was resigning and he withdrew his letter of
resignation and instead took a one-month vacation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter stated that the resignation was to take effect
"after serving the required 30-day notice and turning over period right
after my vacation." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 59.] The
resignation was not to take effect immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The withdrawal thereof on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May
 13, 1981</st1:date> prevented it from becoming effective.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1981</st1:date>
the matter was already settled - petitioner had withdrawn his letter of resignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was therefore surprising why the matter was again taken up
during the <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1981</st1:date>
board meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparent from the minutes
<span style="">is </span>an effort to undo the
withdrawal of the resignation by emphasizing that the letter of resignation was
by its own terms "irrevocable." This shift in the board's sentiment
lends credence to petitioner's charge that some influential directors, together
with <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
conspired to oust him because he did not recommend the brand of boiler that
they were pushing and instead recommended another brand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's counsel's letter to <span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span>
dated June 5, 1981, copies of which were furnished the board of directors, laid
to rest any question as to the withdrawal of the resignation and his intention
to assume his duties <span style="">as </span>Assistant
General Manager upon his return from his vacation.</p>

<p class="BODY">That petitioner was not considered by the board as separated or
resigned is further bolstered by the resolution mentioned in the minutes of the
June 11, 1981 meeting where it was stated:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Resolved that Mr. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span> and
Mr. Victor <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> be informed that whatever is done
by them <span style="">is </span>done in their private
capacity unless it had been brought to [the] board's attention and approved by
the board." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 77.] If indeed petitioner
was no longer connected in any capacity with the cooperative, as so stated in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cuenca</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
notice to suppliers dated <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1981</st1:date>,
then there would be no reason for the resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution implied that petitioner was
still connected <span style="">with the cooperative
and that the dispute between them had </span>not yet been resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, between an act of the board of
directors and that of the general manager, that of the former will have to be
given predominance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the petition is <span style="">GRANTED </span>and the Orders of the Deputy
Minister <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr. in LRD Case No. SI-8453-81,
dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1983</st1:date>, are <span style="">SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Private respondent is <span style="">ORDERED
</span>to reinstate petitioner, without loss of seniority rights and with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for three (3) years without qualification or
deduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, considering the time
that has elapsed, should petitioner's reinstatement to his former or a
substantially equivalent position be no longer feasible, he shall be entitled
to separation pay equivalent to one (1) month's salary for every year of service,
in addition to the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>
