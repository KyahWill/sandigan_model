				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>REGALADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The instant administrative
matter stems from a verified complaint of herein complainants Enrica B. Aguirre
and Nenita A. dela Cruz, dated July 22, 1993, against Judge Candido R. Belmonte
of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 22, Malolos, Bulacan, for gross ignorance of
the law, evident partiality and dishonesty in the performance of his duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complainants were the
offended parties in two criminal cases for murder, both entitled "People
of the Philippines vs. Estelita Hipolito, et al.," docketed as Criminal
Cases </span>Nos. 1024-M-91 and 1025-M-91, filed with the Regional Trial Court
of Malolos, Bulacan and respectively raffled to Branches 20 and 22 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Estelita Hipolito, together with ten others, were
indicted for the ambush-slaying on March 2, 1988 of then Officer-in-Charge
Bernardo Aguirre of San Jose del Monte and his driver, Avelino dela Cruz.  Judge Nicasio Bartolome of the Municipal
Trial Court of Sta. Maria, Bulacan, conducted the preliminary investigation
and, after finding the existence of probable cause, ordered the arrest of all
the accused with no bail fixed for their provisional liberty.  The Office of the Provincial Prosecutor, on
review, ordered the release of the accused in the belief that there was no
probable cause.  On appeal to the
Department of Justice, the latter found that, except <span style="">for </span>one of the accused, there was reasonable ground to hold all
of them for trial and accordingly directed the Office of the Provincial
Prosecutor to file the corresponding informations with no bail recommended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two informations for murder were then filed in the Regional Trial
Court of Malolos, Bulacan and were docketed therein as Criminal Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>1024-M-91 and 1025-M-91,
respectively, the latter case being raffled to Branch 22 presided over by
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants allege, and most of their allegations find support
in the records, that since the two informations arose from one and the same
incident, respondent directed the consolidation of the two cases in his branch
even without any motion therefor being filed by either the accused or the
prosecution.  After the consolidation
was effected, in his order of June 18, 1991 respondent judge directed the
issuance of warrants of arrest against the accused.  At the same time and on his own motion, he also authorized their
provisional release on bail, which he set at P100,000.00 for every accused in
each criminal charge.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Pursuant thereto, the accused posted their bail bonds, were then arraigned, and
thereafter went to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor of Bulacan was ordered
disqualified by the Department of Justice to prosecute the aforementioned
cases, at the instance of the offended parties a state prosecutor was
designated as acting provincial prosecutor.  This state prosecutor, for one reason or another, repeatedly failed to
appear during the trial, prompting respondent judge to issue an order on August
18, 1992<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
for the provisional dismissal of the two cases notwithstanding the presence of
the private prosecutor and the fact that a witness was then undergoing cross?examination.  On motion of the prosecution, however, the
cases were reinstated.  The accused
later sought the reconsideration of this reinstatement on the ground that the
provisional dismissal of the cases although with their consent was tantamount
to an acquittal, there being a violation of their right to a speedy trial.  Respondent found merit in the contentions of
the accused and granted their motion for reconsideration in an order dated
December 15, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, another state prosecutor was designated in place of
the first one who had been appointed to the judiciary.  The new designee filed a motion for
respondent's inhibition and another motion for reconsideration of the order
dismissing the two cases.  The motion
for inhibition was granted by respondent judge and the cases were re-raffled to
Branch 16 of the Regional Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan presided over by
Judge Andres S. Maligaya.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this state of things, complainants have come to us, impugning
the orders of respondent, berating his actuations, and seeking his dismissal
from the service.  On September 15, <span style="">1993, </span>this Court required respondent
to comment on the aforementioned complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and,
after he was furnished a copy of the same, he submitted his answer dated
November 26, 1993.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While respondent admits the factual antecedents as mentioned in
the complaint, he submits that insofar as the consolidation of the cases is
concerned, it was Judge Amante M. Laforteza of Branch 20 who transferred
Criminal Case No. 1025-M-91 to his sala in an order dated June 14, 1991.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, he avers that the consolidation of related cases to the branch
bearing the lower number is a common practice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends that he granted bail to the accused based on
our "Decision entitled ‘Vicente Lim, et al.,’ (sic) G.R. No. 94054-57
dated February 19, 1991, requiring and empowering the Judge to study the
evidence before him before issuing a warrant of arrest."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
From this he argues "that the obligation to go over the evidence
necessarily carries with it the right to refuse to issue the warrant w(h)ere he
disagrees with the finding of the prosecutor who filed the information."
Under that premise, he concluded "that if he can legally refuse to issue a
warrant, he must necessarily have the power to reduce or give bail, even
without hearing and even without any motion (for) bail being filed.  This is on the theory that the whole is
bigger than its parts.  The whole here is
to refuse to issue the warrant, the parts being to grant or reduce bail."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He then asseverates that before the <i><span style="">Lim</span></i><span style=""> </span>case,
there was absolutely no evidence submitted from which a judge could conclude
that the evidence of guilt is not strong, unlike in cases subsequent thereto
wherein the evidence of the prosecution is attached to the information, so that
the judge can, by studying it, reasonably conclude whether the evidence of
guilt is strong, for the denial of bail, or not strong, for the grant or
reduction of bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further claims that his order granting bail was not posited on
the Rules of Court or the other decisions of this Court "requiring
petition for bail, no bail and hearing on bail" which he did not consider
applicable, but on the decision of this Court in the <i><span style="">Lim</span></i><span style=""> </span>case.  It was supposedly only much later when he
read in the newspapers about the Court's warning to judges against granting
bail in capital offenses without hearing that he realized that he could have
made a mistake.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent also explains that while many witnesses were mentioned
in the information, only one was a relevant witness, a policeman who claimed to
have been a bodyguard <span style="">of </span>one of
the accused and had allegedly heard conversations of the accused at one time or
another wherein they conspired to kill the victims.  Respondent avers that he found it hard to believe that a
bodyguard who is not part of the conspiracy would be so privileged or trusted
as to be allowed to hear and witness said conversations and/or actuations on
conspiracy to kill without being inculpated in the plan so as to silence him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, he submits that any error on his part in
interpreting this Court's ruling in the <i><span style="">Lim</span></i><span style=""> </span>case was
deemed corrected when the prosecution did not file any motion to cancel the
bail he had granted, nor any motion for clarification if, indeed, his aforesaid
order granting bail was improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the provisional dismissal of the cases against two of the
accused, respondent asserts that the same was premised on the constitutional
right of the accused to a speedy trial and was occasioned by the frequent
absences of the state prosecutor, resulting in the cancellation of the hearings
and causing undue hardship on the defense lawyers coming from Metro
Manila.  This caused him to issue an
order on <span style="">July </span>22, 1992 citing
the state prosecutor for contempt.  The
presence of the private prosecutor was of no moment, considering that no valid
hearing could be had without the presence of the public prosecutor.  The fact that a witness was still under
cross-examination at that time was only a minor technicality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, he professes that, contrary to complainants' allegations,
the motion for reconsideration of his order of December 15, 1992 which, it may
be recalled, declared the order dismissing the cases against two accused as
equivalent to an acquittal and not merely a provisional dismissal, had already
been denied by Branch 16 of the same court to which the cases had been
re-raffled, thereby upholding his aforesaid order.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no serious dispute on or controversion of the facts
of this administrative matter as would affect our disposition thereof, pursuant
to revised Rule 140 the Court resolved on June 15, 1994 to refer the matter to
the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation, report and
recommendation.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Deputy Court Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez thereafter submitted to the Court
his memorandum dated August 5, 1994.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the instant proceeding hinges on the legal
propriety of the orders issued by respondent regarding the consolidation of the
two murder cases in Branch 22, the granting of bail <i><span style="">m</span></i><i><span style="">otu proprio</span></i><span style=""> </span>to the accused, and the subsequent
dismissal, which was later declared to be in fact an acquittal, with regard to
accused Estelita Hipolito and Alfredo Bolsico in both cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough review of the records of this administrative
matter and the memorandum thereon, we find that the consolidation of the two
murder cases in Branch 22 presided over by respondent was proper.  As respondent correctly explained, it was
Judge Amante M. Laforteza of Branch 20 of the court below who ordered the
consolidation of the cases pursuant to a motion therefor of counsel for the
accused in one of the cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
case assigned to Branch 22 had the lower docket number, hence it was properly
consolidated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the issue on the <i><span style="">sua
sponte</span></i><span style=""> </span>grant of bail,
without any motion or application therefor by any of the accused and without
any notice to the prosecution or any hearing conducted therein, complainants
have valid cause to complain.  The
fundamental law on bail as found in Section 13, Article III of the 1987
Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"All persons, except those charged with offenses punishable by
<i>reclusion perpetua</i> when evidence of guilt is strong, shall, before
conviction, be bailable by sufficient sureties or be released on recognizance
as may be provided by law." <span style="">x x </span>x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Complementary thereto, Section 3, Rule 114 of the governing 1985
Rules on Criminal Procedure,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> as
amended, reiterated that:</p>

<blockquote>"All persons in custody shall, before final conviction, be
entitled to bail as a matter of right, except those charged with a capital
offense or an offense which, under the law at the time of its commission and at
the time of the application for bail, is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,
when evidence of guilt is strong."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A capital offense is defined as an offense which, under the law
existing at the time of its commission, and at the time of the application to
be admitted to bail, may be punished with death.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> The
grant of bail, therefore, becomes a matter of discretion if the accused is
charged with a capital offense.  In order
to determine whether bail should be granted or withheld, the court must
necessarily satisfy itself whether or not the evidence of guilt is strong, and
the order granting or refusing the same should contain a summary of the
evidence presented by the prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present administrative matter, the accused were charged
with murder, a capital offense, in two cases.  Hence, the issue of whether or not they should be admitted to bail lies on
the strength of the prosecution's evidence as to their guilt.  The question to be resolved now, in view of
the submissions of respondent judge, is whether in the determination of the
strength of the evidence of guilt, the trial judge should first conduct <span style="">a </span>hearing or just rely on whatever
documentary evidence is attached to the information or appears in the record of
the case before him.  This is not a
novel question.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i><span style="">Libarios vs.
Dabalos</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Judge Rosarito F. Dabalos granted provisional
liberty to two of the accused on a bail of P50,000.00 each on the ground that
they were not charged as co-principals by cooperation or inducement, and that
the evidence of guilt against them was merely circumstantial.  It was argued therein that Section 5, Rule
114 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure which requires a hearing of an
application for admission to bail is applicable only to cases where the accused
is already in custody.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rejecting his arguments, the Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"It has been an established legal principle or rule that in
cases where a person is accused of a capital offense, the trial court must
conduct a hearing in a summary proceeding, to allow the prosecution an
opportunity to present, within a reasonable time, all evidence it may desire to
produce to prove that the evidence of guilt against the accused is strong,
before resolving the issue of bail for the temporary release of the <span style="">accused.  Failure to conduct a hearing before fixing bail in the instant case
amounted to a violation of due process.  Irrespective of respondent judge's opinion that the evidence of guilt
against herein accused is not strong, the law and settled jurisprudence
demanded that a hearing be conducted before bail was fixed for the temporary
release of accused Calo, Jr. and Allocod, if bail was at all justified.  Respondent judge’s disregard of an
established rule of law by depriving the prosecution of the opportunity to
prove that the evidence of guilt against the accused was strong, amounted to
gross ignorance of the law, which is subject to disciplinary action."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the more recent case <span style="">of
</span><i><span style="">Borinaga vs. Tamin</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>an amended criminal complaint for
murder was filed before the municipal circuit trial court for preliminary
investigation.  While the case was pending
with the said court still on preliminary investigation, a petition for bail was
filed by the accused in the regional trial court.  Pursuant to this petition, respondent Judge Camilo E. Tamin set
the case for hearing.  On the scheduled
date of hearing, the public prosecutor failed to appear, presumably because no
information had yet been filed in the trial court, but respondent judge
nonetheless issued an order granting bail to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the municipal circuit trial court which conducted
the preliminary investigation issued a resolution recommending the filing of an
information for murder against the accused, which resolution was affirmed by
the provincial prosecutor.  As a
consequence thereof, an information for murder was filed against all the
accused, with no bail recommended.  Subsequently, the public prosecutor therein filed a motion for the
cancellation of the bail and the arrest of the accused on the ground that the
accused was charged with a capital offense, the evidence of guilt was strong,
and no bail was recommended in the information.  Respondent judge, however, issued an order denying said motion
without conducting a hearing thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Repudiating his acts, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x (B)ail is a matter of discretion where the accused is
charged with a capital offense or an offense punishable by <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> and the evidence of guilt is strong.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x, (W)here admission to bail is a matter of discretion,
the prosecution has the burden of showing that evidence of guilt is
strong.  x x x (A)dmission to bail as a
matter of discretion presupposes the exercise thereof in accordance with law
and guided by the applicable legal principles.  The prosecution must first be accorded an opportunity to present
evidence because by the very nature of deciding applications for bail, it is on
the basis of such evidence that judicial discretion is weighed against in
determining whether the guilt of the <span style="">accused
is strong.  In other words, discretion
must be exercised regularly, legally and within the confines of procedural due
process, that is, after evaluation of the evidence submitted by the
prosecution.  x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the first place, respondent judge did not have the
authority to set the petition for bail for hearing in view of the fact that he
had not even acquired jurisdiction over the criminal case since the information
therefor had not yet been filed in the trial court.  In doing so, he acted with grave abuse of discretion and in wanton
disregard of established rules and jurisprudence.  Secondly, it has been held that even where the prosecutor refuses
to adduce evidence in <span style="">opposition to the
application to grant and fix bail, the court may ask the prosecution such
questions as would ascertain the strength of the state's evidence or judge the
adequacy of the amount of bail.  Here,
the non-appearance of the prosecution at the hearing scheduled by respondent
judge on March 30, 1992 was obviously justified since, to repeat, respondent
had no authority to schedule and/or conduct the same."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the aforecited case of <i>Lim, Sr., et al. vs. Felix, et al</i>.,
the primary issue was whether or not a judge may issue a warrant of arrest by
simply relying on the prosecutor's certification or recommendation that a
probable cause exists.  The Court resolved
the issue following established doctrines and procedures that a judge, in
personally determining the existence of probable cause, is not required to
personally examine the complainant and his witnesses.  Rather, he may personally evaluate the certification as well as
the supporting documents submitted by the prosecutor regarding the existence of
probable cause and, on the basis thereof, issue a warrant of arrest; or if, on
the basis thereof, he finds no probable cause, he may disregard the prosecutor's
report and require the submission of supporting affidavits of witnesses to aid
him in arriving at a conclusion as to the existence of probable cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether wittingly or unwittingly, respondent’s reliance on the <i>Lim</i>
case is sorely misplaced.  He could not
have failed to apprehend that what was involved therein was the appreciation of
evidence initially presented by the prosecution for the determination by the
trial court as to <span style="">whether the <i>filing
of an information</i> </span><span style="">was </span>justified.  What is involved in <span style="">such a situation is the <i>commencement of a criminal action</i>.  </span>The quantum of evidence required
therefor is only such evidence as suffices to engender a well founded belief as
to the fact of the commission of a crime and the therein respondent's probable
guilt thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the question of the propriety of the commencement of
the criminal actions is not involved herein.  The issue, as earlier mentioned, refers to the <i><span style="">propriety of the order</span></i><span style=""> </span>of respondent issued <i><span style="">ex parte</span></i><span style=""> </span>which granted bail<i> </i><i><span style="">ex mero motu</span></i><span style=""> </span>to
the accused who were charged with non?bailable offenses, <i><span style="">without</span></i><span style=""> </span>said accused having filed a motion therefor, <i><span style="">without</span></i><span style=""> </span>notice to the prosecution, and <i><span style="">without</span></i><span style=""> </span>any
hearing having been conducted to determine the <i><span style="">strength of the prosecution's evidence</span></i><span style=""> </span>which involves an evidential quantum
different from that required in preliminary investigations.  Compounding the responsibility of respondent
judge is the fact that the accused were not even in the custody of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not subscribe to respondent's supposedly belated
realization of the mistake he committed after reading in the newspapers about
this Court's warning against the grant of bail in capital offenses without the
benefit of a hearing.  Even before its
pronouncement in the <i><span style="">Lim</span></i><span style=""> </span>case, this Court already ruled in <i><span style="">People vs. Dacudao, etc., et al</span></i><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that a hearing is mandatory before
bail can be granted to an accused who is charged with a capital offense, in
this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent court acted irregularly in granting bail in a
murder case without any hearing on the motion asking for it, without bothering
to ask the prosecution for its conformity or comment, as it turned out later,
over its strong objections.  The court
granted bail on the sole basis of the complaint and the affidavits of three
policemen, not one of whom apparently witnessed the killing.  Whatever the court possessed at the time it
issued the questioned ruling was intended only for <i>prima facie </i>determining
whether or not there is sufficient ground to engender a well?founded
belief that the crime was committed and pinpointing the persons who probably
committed it.  Whether or not the
evidence of guilt is strong for each individual accused still has to be
established unless the prosecution submits the issue on whatever it has already
presented.  To appreciate the strength
or weakness of the evidence of guilt, the prosecution must be consulted or
heard.  It is equally entitled as the
accused to due process.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Certain guidelines in the fixing of a bailbond call for the
presentation of evidence and reasonable opportunity for the prosecution to
refute it.  Among them are the nature
and circumstances of the crime, character and reputation of the accused, the
weight of the evidence against him, the probability of the accused appearing at
the trial, whether or not the accused is a fugitive from justice, and whether
or not the accused is under bond in other cases.  (Section 6, Rule 114, Rules of Court)  It is highly doubtful if the trial court can appreciate these
guidelines in an ex-parte determination where the Fiscal is neither present nor
heard."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What magnifies the aforementioned procedural misfeasance and
nonfeasance of respondent judge is the fact that when he issued his order
granting bail, the accused were admittedly still at large.  This, of course, he knew as he even had to
direct their arrest right in the same order where he simultaneously granted
them bail.  It is incredible that he
could have been unaware that as early as 1961, it was explicitly clarified in <i>Feliciano
vs. Pasicolan, etc., et al</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> that
since bail is intended to obtain the provisional liberty of the accused, the
same cannot be authorized or posted before custody of said accused has been
acquired by the judicial authorities by his arrest or voluntary surrender.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="">self-evident that </span>a
court cannot authorize provisional liberty to one who is then actually in the
enjoyment of his liberty, or as the Court quoted therein, "it would be
incongruous to grant bail to one who is free.” The pernicious practice which
such ruling was intended to prevent, whereby the accused can just send someone
to post his bail without recognizing the authority of the court by his personal
appearance therein and compliance with the requirements therefor, appears to
have been resuscitated by respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent postulated that any error he committed in granting
bail was deemed corrected by the failure of the prosecution to file in either
of the two criminal cases any motion for the cancellation thereof or a
clarification of his order.  This is a
strained and illogical theory.  It has
long been held that even if the prosecution fails to adduce evidence in
opposition to an application for bail of an accused, the court may still
require that it answer questions in order to ascertain not only the strength of
the state's evidence but also the adequacy of the amount of bail.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The same rationale for that doctrine applies to and refutes the aforesaid
proposition of respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, therefore, respondent's act of granting bail <span style="">to </span>the accused, under the circumstances
earlier catalogued and ramified, indubitably amounts to such a whimsical and
arbitrary exercise of jurisdiction which calls for this Court's exercise of its
disciplinary power.  Respondent should
be aware that since he is to administer the law and apply it to the facts, he
should endeavor diligently to ascertain the facts and the applicable law.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
A <span style="">judge owes </span>it to the public
and the administration of justice to know the law he is supposed to apply to a
given controversy.  He is called upon to
exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with the statutes and procedural
rules.  There will be faith in the
administration of justice only if there be a belief on the part of litigants
that the occupants of the bench cannot justly be accused of a deficiency in
their grasp of <span style="">legal </span>principles.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of the propriety of the respondent's order
provisionally dismissing the two murder cases, this Court is not in a position
to pass upon its correctness since the records of the instant case do not show
the reasons why and the exact number of times the state prosecutor concerned
was absent as would justify <span style="">a </span>dismissal
of the criminal cases for the alleged violation of the right to speedy trial of
two of the accused.  Moreover, the
motion for reconsideration of the order of unconditional dismissal of December
15, 1992 <span style="">is </span>still pending
resolution before Branch 16 of the Regional <span style="">Trial </span>Court of Malolos, Bulacan, contrary to respondent's
allegation that the same <span style="">had </span>already
been denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent must have been misled by the fact that there were
actually two motions for reconsideration for resolution by Branch 16.  The first was directed against his order
dated March 10, 1992 granting the prosecution's motion for inhibition, while
the second motion sought the reconsideration of his order of December 15, 1992
declaring the provisional dismissal against two of the accused in the murder
cases as amounting to an acquittal.  The
first motion was denied by Branch 16 in its order of August 24, 1993 for being
moot and academic since the movant was deemed to have recognized the
jurisdiction of the court over the case with the filing of several pleadings
seeking affirmative relief.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> The
second motion has not yet been resolved and should not be passed upon by the
Court in this administrative matter.  In
any event, the present contents of the record do not clearly show that
respondent acted with manifest partiality or culpable duplicity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the administrative matters <span style="">of <i>Libarios </i></span>and<i> Borinaga</i> which involved virtually
the same charges, the erring judges were fined in the amount of
P20,000.00.  We believe, however, that
respondent judge herein should be meted a fine in a higher amount since his
actuations complained of in the present proceeding are of a nature graver than
those committed in the two cases aforementioned.  For, in addition to the errors common to all these three
administrative matters as hereinbefore explained, the accused in the criminal
cases involved in <i><span style="">Libarios</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i>Borinaga</i> <span style="">had at least filed petitions for their
provisional liberty.  Here, </span>there
was no application for bail filed by any of the accused in either of the two
criminal cases hence, as complainants put it, respondent judge was not only the
grantor of the bail but likewise the applicant therefor.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
On top of that, in <i>Borinaga</i>, the accused therein had already been
apprehended when he applied for and was granted bail, albeit erroneously.  In the present proceeding before us,
respondent judge granted bail to the accused who were all at large.</p>
