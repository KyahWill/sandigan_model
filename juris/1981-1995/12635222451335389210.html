This petition for <em>certiorari </em>and mandamus was filed by the 
National Housing Authority against an order of respondent Judge Otilio 
Abaya of the National Capital Region with the Union Chemicals, Inc. as 
private respon­dent.  The order complained of excluded from an 
expropria­tion proceeding certain areas to "be devoted exclusively to 
the fulfillment by Union Chemicals of its contractual obligation to its 
employees in accordance with the approval by the Human Settlement 
Regulatory Commission, Ministry of Human Settlement."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  Petitioner posed the issue thus:  "May a landowner whose properties 
are the subject of expropriation proceedings seek the exclusion of the 
same from the said proceedings and evade condemnation of his properties 
by merely representing that said properties <em>are also to be devoted by him </em>to a public purpose?  In the case at bar, such a defense was raised.  And this was done <em>one year </em>after
 expropriation proceedings were commenced by the petitioner.  
Nonetheless, the trial court gave its imprimatur to private respondent's
 defense and excluded its properties from coverage of the expropriation 
proceedings clearly, in grave abuse of discretion."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
<p>
This Court required respondents to comment.  Such Comment was submitted 
by private respondent.  At the outset, it referred to what was referred 
to as inaccuracies in the statement of facts in the petition and added: 
 "The records show that the particular issue of whether a property 
already devoted to a public purpose can still be expropriated for the 
same public purpose is not an 'afterthought' and that it was not 'raised
 one year after expropriation proceedings were commenced.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  It then argued that respondent Judge acted well within his 
jurisdiction and with sound exercise of discretion in excluding the 
subject properties from the expro­priation proceedings and that <em>certiorari </em>is not the proper remedy.
</p><p>
The Comment was considered as the Answer; the petition was given due 
course; and the parties required to submit their memoranda.  Thereafter,
 upon their being filed, the petition was ready for deliberation and 
subsequently for decision.
</p><p>
On May 22, 1984, petitioner and private respondent submitted a 
Compromise Agreement dated May 10, 1984.  They stipulated and agreed on 
the following: "1. On October 30, 1980, Petitioner instituted Civil Case
 No. 39068, entitled 'National Housing Authority vs. Celso de los 
Angeles, et al.', with the then Court of First Instance of Pasig for the
 expropriation of parcels of land located in Pasig, Metro Manila and 
Cainta, Rizal, to be developed into a Sites and Services Project; 2. 
Petitioner has already acquired a large portion of the project area, 
part of which is contiguous area now covered by Transfer Certificates of
 Title Nos. 36336, 37191, 41056, 36337 and 37536; 3. Respondent UCI owns
 property interspaced in the area already owned by NHA, and covered by 
Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 25431, 25432, 25433, 25434, 25435, 
25436, 25437, 7873 and 11897, and which property petitioner seeks to 
expropriate in Civil Case No. 39068; 4. On petition of respondent UCI, 
respondent court issued an Order dated December 17, 1982 excluding some 
of respondent's properties from the aforementioned project, and which 
Order is now the subject of the instant petition for <em>certiorari </em>and <em>mandamus</em>;
 5. To expedite the early reso­lution of this case, respondent UCI, 
pursuant to UCI Board Resolution No. [Unnumbered], copy attached as 
Annex 'A' hereof, offered to exchange its aforementioned fragmented 
properties with a property of equal area already acquired by the 
petitioner, and petitioner accepted the said offer to hasten the 
completion of the development of its aforementioned Sites and Services 
Project; 6. Under NHA Board Resolution No. 866 dated March 15, 1984, 
copy attached as Annex 'B' hereof, the General Manager of the petitioner
 has been authorized to enter into an agreement with respondent UCI, for
 exchange of some of NHA acquired property in the project area with 
respondent's property of UCI within same project site to enable the 
petitioner to consolidate its project into one contiguous area; 7. 
Accordingly, respondent UCI hereby assigns, cedes, and conveys unto the 
petitioner, free from liens and encumbrances, a total net area of 87,699
 square meters of its real property covered by Transfer Certificates of 
Title Nos. 25431, 25432, 25433, 25434, 25435, 25436, 25437, 7873 and 
11897, deducting therefrom 1,827 square meters of land being used by the
 National Power Corporation for power transmission line; and by way of 
exchange for the said property of respondent UCI, petitioner hereby 
assigns, cedes, and conveys unto respondent UCI free from liens and 
encumbrances, its property also with the same total net area of 87,699 
square meters covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 36336, 
37191, 41056, 36337 and 37536, after deducting therefrom 5,740 square 
meters and another area of 5,565 square meters being used by the 
National Power Corporation for power transmission line; 8. The 
petitioner shall provide respondent UCI an 8-meter access and 
right-of-way free of charge in consideration of the exchange of the said
 properties of respondent UCI with the property of the petitioner; 9. 
The parties shall retain titles to their respective areas being used by 
the National Power Corpo­ration for power transmission line, and they 
shall pursue their respective claims against the National Power 
Corporation for payment of the right-of-way for its power transmission 
line; 10. The location plan reflecting and embodying the detailed 
agreement mentioned in the imme­diately preceding paragraphs, as well as
 the relative positions of the affected land area, is attached as Annex 
'C' and made integral part hereof; 11. The cost of survey for the 
segregation of the areas subject of the exchange, shall be charged to 
and shouldered by respondent UCI.  All other necessary and incidental 
expenses, such as regis­tration and other legal fees, shall be equally 
shouldered by the parties; 12. The parties agree to waive all claims 
they have against each other in Civil Case No. 39068, and they further 
agree that this Compromise Agreement is a final settlement of the said 
claims; 13. The parties agree to faithfully comply with the foregoing 
terms and conditions and after same have been approved by this 
Hono­rable Court, the Compromise Agreement shall partake of the nature 
of court judgment that any violations thereof by any party shall entitle
 the aggrieved party to a writ of execution of this Compromise 
Agreement.  [Wherefore], it is respectfully prayed that this Compromise 
Agreement be approved and judgment be rendered thereon enjoining the 
parties to faithfully comply with the terms and conditions thereof."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The Court approves such Compromise Agreement and enjoins the parties to comply faithfully with its terms and conditions.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed.  No costs.
