two separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, for violation of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 2934) and

3007).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a joint trial of the two
cases, respondent Judge Pedro <span class="SpellE">Laggui</span> of the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> promulgated a joint decision on
September 24, 1986, (1) dismissing the information in Criminal Case No. 2934
(for violation of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22) for being
"fatally defective" (p. 63, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), and (2)
convicting the accused of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> in Criminal Case No.
3007.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused appealed the decision in Criminal Case No. 3007 to
the Court of Appeals, which on July 26, 1988, reversed and set aside the
judgment of the Regional Trial Court, thereby acquitting the accused <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, "without prejudice
to the person entitled to (sic) the civil action for restitution of the thing
and reparation or indemnity for the damage suffered." (CA-G.R. No. 04096,
p. 615, Records in Criminal Case No. 2934, Vol. II.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The State filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
assailing the dismissal of the allegedly defective information in Criminal Case
No. 2934 and praying that the trial court be ordered to reinstate the case and
render judgment as the law and the evidence warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge filed his own Comments on the petition, to
defend his order in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused adopted the Judge's comments <span class="GramE">as his own</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised by the petition is a legal one: whether or
not the information in Criminal Case No. 2934 is indeed "fatally defective."
The information reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"The undersigned Acting Provincial Fiscal and Assistant

<p class="BODY">The accused (now private respondent) <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> is a minister of the "<st1:place><st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype>

<span class="GramE">(p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span> He first met
the offended party Lolita O. <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> in July or August,
1983, when her godson, <span class="SpellE">Arcadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>,
who is a member of <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> congregation, introduced
the latter to her, <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> became interested in <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> religious group and became a member thereof on
November 27, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second week of August 1983, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
confided to <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> his worries about his indebtedness
of P250<span class="GramE">,000</span> to Dr.<b> </b>and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The obligation was secured by a mortgage on the congregation's property
which would mature on October 4, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> offered to help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She agreed to lend P250<span class="GramE">,000</span> in cash to <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> who would issue a post-dated check to her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>the same amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">To raise the P250<span class="GramE">,000</span>, <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> borrowed against her time deposit at the Unity
Savings and Loan Association, Inc, (USLA).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since she and her husband were leaving for the United States on a short
trip <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>August 1983, she signed
the necessary papers for the loan before their departure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">She </span>also
executed a special power of attorney authorizing her daughter, Rose Anne <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span>, to receive from USLA the P250<span class="GramE">,000</span>-check
representing the proceeds of her loan and to endorse and deliver it to <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> upon <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> issuing to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">her </span>a post-dated check for the
same amount of P250,000.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on
October 4, 1983, Rose Anne got the P250<span class="GramE">,000</span> check from
the USLA, endorsed it to <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> who issued, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>exchange <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>,
his <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino check for the same amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His check was undated.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Lolita <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> arrived from her trip
on October 16, 1983, she asked <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> why his check
bore no date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
told her to date it "July 18, 1984" (pp. 26-27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)
so he would have sufficient time to fund it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> deposited the check on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>date, the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span>
bank dishonored it because <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> account with it
had been closed as of July 10, 1984, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one
</span>week before the due date of the check.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial on the merits, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
admitted that when he issued the check he did not have enough funds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>the bank, and that he failed to
deposit the needed amount to cover it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He alleged that he issued the check as "a temporary receipt for
what he had received" (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
December 2, 1985; pp. 10 and 35, RTC Decision, p. 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite repeated demands to make good his check, or to replace it
with cash, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> did neither.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated September 1, 1986, the trial court ruled
that the accused could not be convicted of a violation of the Bouncing Checks
Law, B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22, because the information failed to
allege that he knew, when he<b> </b>issued the check, that he would not have
sufficient funds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>its payment
in full upon its presentment to the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the opinion of the trial judge, the
information <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">did </span>not charge an
offense, hence, he dismissed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>, the
State alleges that the information is <span class="GramE">sufficient,</span>
hence, respondent Judge committed an error of law, and/or gravely abused his
discretion, in dismissing Criminal Case No. 2934.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was charged with having violated Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22, which provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">The "defect" which respondent Judge perceived in the
information was the failure to allege that the accused, as maker <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>drawer of the check at the time of
issue, knew of the insufficiency of his funds in the bank for payment of the
check in full "upon its presentment" (p. 56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the court's opinion, it was not enough for
the information to have alleged that the accused knew when he issued the check
that he <u>then</u> did not have sufficient funds in the bank; the information
should have alleged that the accused knew that he would not have sufficient
funds in the bank to pay the check in full "<u>upon its presentment</u>."
It believed that the absence of an allegation that the accused foresaw or had
foreknowledge of the insufficiency of his bank account upon presentment of the
check for <span class="GramE">payment,</span> was fatal to the information.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">This case is somewhat
similar to the case of US vs. Yam <span class="SpellE">Tung</span> Way, 21 Phil.
67, where this Court ruled that the defendant, after having been discharged by
a competent court, cannot again be put on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">trial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for the same

of the court upon some question of law arising at the trial; no appeal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lies </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in such case on behalf of the government." The accused therein was
charged with infringement of literary rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After trial, he moved for the dismissal of the information on the ground
that the evidence of the Government did not establish the commission of the
offense charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court reserved its
judgment on the motion and required</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">
the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> defendant to submit his
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, it discharged him
on the ground </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that no copyright
law existed then in the Philippines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Government appealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court
held that the Government had no right to appeal:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"Defendant was regularly arraigned, pleaded not guilty, put
upon his trial by the calling of the government's witnesses against him, and
thereafter discharged by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that the court made no express finding as to whether the
defendant did or did not commit the specific acts set out in the information,
and that the dismissal of the information was based on the court's conclusion
of law that there being no copyright law in force in these Islands, the acts
which it is alleged were committed by the defendant do not constitute the crime
with which he was charged, nor any other offense defined and penalized by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the reasoning and authority of
the opinion of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <span class="SpellE">Kepner</span> vs. United States, <u>supra</u>, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>conclusively against the right of
appeal by the government from a judgment discharging the defendant in a
criminal case after he has been </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">brought
to trial, whether defendant </span>was </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">acquitted on the merits or whether defendant's discharge was based upon
the trial court's conclusion of law that the trial had failed for some reason
to establish the guilt of the defendant as charged.<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"As indicated in the opinion in that case, the protection
afforded by the prohibition against the putting of any person twice in jeopardy
for the same offense, is a protection not merely against the peril of second
punishment, but against being tried a second time for the same offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case the court expressly held that:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>‘It follows </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that M</span>ilitary Order No. 58, as amended
by Act of the Philippine Commission, No. 194, insofar as it undertakes to
permit an appeal by the Government after acquittal, was repealed by the Act of
Congress of July, 1902, providing immunity from second jeopardy for the same
criminal offense.'<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote><i>"But the reasoning of the opinion goes further and denies the
right to the Government to procure the reversal of erroneous proceedings and
commence anew, save only in those cases in which the first proceeding did not
create legal jeopardy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So that, without
his own consent, a defendant who has once been brought to trial in a court of
competent jurisdiction cannot be again put on trial for the same offense after </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the first trial has terminated by a judgment
directing his discharge, whether his discharge </span>be </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the result of a formal acquittal, or of a </span>ruling
of </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the court upon some question
of law arising at the </span>trial.” (US vs. Yam <span class="SpellE">Tung</span>
