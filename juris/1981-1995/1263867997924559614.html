				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking to set
aside the resolutions of the respondent Court of Appeals dated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1975</st1:date>, dismissing the appeal of petitioner in CA-G.R. No.
57556-R entitled "Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank, Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> vs. Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>,
et. al., Defendants-appellants", (b) <st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1975</st1:date> denying petitioner's motion for
reconsideration, and (c) January 13, 1976 denying petitioner's second motion
for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Carlos <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span> is the
defendant-appellant in a case for collection of sum of money against whom the
decision was rendered by the trial court on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff, who is now the respondent in the instant <span class="GramE">petition</span>, is a banking institution duly organized and
existing under and by <span style="">virtue of </span>the
laws of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and is the creditor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1962</st1:date>,
petitioner borrowed from the plaintiff the sum of ten thousand (P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) pesos as evidenced by a promissory note executed
and signed by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> and Carlos <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dimayuga</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
indebtedness was to be paid on <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="5">May 7,
 1962</st1:date> with interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum in
case of non-payment at maturity as evidenced by and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the promissory note executed jointly and severally by
defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the aforementioned promissory note, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>
bound himself to pay jointly and severally with Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>
interest at the rate of 10% per annum on the said amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> until fully paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, both undertook to "jointly and severally authorize the
respondent Philippine Com­mercial and Industrial Bank, at its option to apply
to the payment of this note any and all funds, securities or other real or
personal <span style="">property </span>of value which
hands (sic) on deposit or otherwise belonging to anyone or all of us." <span class="GramE">(p. 56, RA; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 15).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the default of the promissory to pay, a complaint was filed
on <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1969</st1:date> by the
Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank for sum of money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant Carlos <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>, now
petitioner, however, had remitted to the plaintiff (now respondent) the amount <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by way of
partial payments made from <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="8">August 1,
 1969</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1970</st1:date>
as evidenced by corresponding receipts thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These payments were nevertheless applied to past interests, charges and
partly on the principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1974</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered a decision holding defendants jointly and severally
liable to pay the plaintiff the sum of P9<span class="GramE">,139.60</span> with
interest at 10% per annum until fully paid plus P913.96 as attorneys’ fees and
costs against defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 11, 1974, petitioner filed <span style="">a </span>motion alleging that <span style="">since
</span>Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> died on December 23, 1973, the
money claim of the respondents should be dismissed and prosecuted against the
estate of the late Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> as provided in
Sec. <span style="">5, </span>Rule 86, <span class="GramE">New</span> Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On June 22, 1974, the trial court denied the motion for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied, the petitioner appealed to the respondent
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was opposed by the
respondent PCIB in a motion to dismiss the appeal, on the ground that the
record on appeal did not disclose data showing that the appeal was perfected on
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In opposition to the respondent's
motion to dismiss, the petitioner Carlos <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>
insisted that the appeal was perfected on time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On September 30, 1975, the Court of Appeals in a resolution dated
September 30, 1975 dismissed the appeal for failure of the Record on Appeal to
show on its face that the appeal was timely perfected.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged by herein petitioner that the Court of Appeals
erred in dismissing the appeal on the ground that the printed records on appeal
failed to show that it was perfected on time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 18, 1976, the respondent Philippine Commercial and
Industrial Bank filed its comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the resolution dated April <span style="">2, </span>1976,
the Supreme Court through its Second Division resolved to treat the petition
for review as a special civil action and required both parties to submit their
simultaneous memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1976, the petitioner submitted his memorandum while
private respondent submitted its corresponding memorandum on May 25, 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the Court of
Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal for failure of the Record on Appeal to
show on its face that the appeal had been timely perfected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among others, respondent <span class="SpellE">PCIB's</span>
objection to this appeal is predicated on the fact that petitioner failed to
state in <span style="">his </span>record on appeal
the date when he received the copy of the decision, the denial and/or granting
of the second motion filed although the same may be found in a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent bank
insisted that petitioner's belated act in reciting the data in a motion for
reconsideration of the resolution of the <span style="">Court
</span>of Appeals did not cure this defect.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue has long been laid to rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although no record on appeal is now required
to take an appeal (section 39, BPB 129), this Court had long discarded the
rigid application of the material data rule (section 6, Rule 41) in appeals
from Courts of First Instance to the Appellate Court (Luzon Concrete Products,
Inc. <span style="">v. </span>Court of Appeals, 135
SCRA 463 [1985]; <span class="SpellE">Abando</span> v. C.A., 83 SCRA 511
[1978]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the mere absence of a
formal order granting the motion for extension of time to file record on appeal
should not be fatal to the petitioner if the record on appeal filed within the
requested period was approved by the court <u><span style="">a quo</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The approval thereof, as in the case
at bar, carries with it the approval of the motion for extension and the mere <span style="">failure </span>of the record on appeal <span style="">to </span>show such approval should not defeat
the right to appeal (<span class="SpellE">Berkenkotter</span> v. Court of
Appeals, 53 SCRA 22 [1973]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellate court may properly rely on the trial court’s order of approval and
could determine <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> without sending for or examining
any other records that the appeal was perfected on time as expressly found by
the trial court (<span class="SpellE">Saura</span> Import &amp; Export Co., Inc.
v. Court of Appeals, 83 SCRA 276 [1978]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the appeal interposed by the petitioner from the
decision of the trial court should be given due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, to remand the case to the Court of
Appeals would only delay the final disposition of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, this Court has consistently
ruled that remand of a case to a lower court for the reception of evidence is
not necessary where the Supreme Court could resolve the dispute already based
on the records before it (<span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span> v. C.A., 122
SCRA 704 [1983]; Board of Liquidators vs. <span class="SpellE">Zulueta</span>,
115 SCRA 549 [1982]; Velasco v. C.A., 95 SCRA 617 [1980]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A case involving an interlocutory order which
would have been referred to the Court of Appeals was decided by the Supreme
Court if only to make up for time lost (<span class="SpellE">Sacdalan</span> v.
Bautista, 56 SCRA 176 [1974]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
in view of the long <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a case, this Court
finds “that the greater interest of justice demands that the case should be
disposed on the merits at this stage x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>” (<span class="SpellE">Limpan</span> Investment Corporation
v. <span class="SpellE">Sundiam</span>, 157 SCRA 209 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence presented, there can be no dispute that Carlos <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span> bound himself jointly and severally with Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, now deceased, to pay the obligation with PCIB in
the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> plus 10% interest per
annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, as above stated, in
case of non-payment, they undertook among others to jointly and severally
authorize respondent bank, at its option to apply to the payment of this note,
any and all funds, securities, real or personal properties, etc. belonging to
anyone or all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated,
the promissory note in question provides in unmistakable language that the
obligation of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span> is <span style="">joint </span>and several with Pedro C. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is the position
of the petitioner that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span> having died on
December 23, 1973, the money claim of PCIB should be dismissed and prosecuted
against the estate of the late <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled under the law and jurisprudence that when the
obligation is <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, the creditor may bring his
action <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> against the debtors obligated <u><span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">solidum</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As expressly allowed by Article 1216 of the
Civil Code, the creditor may proceed against any one of the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
debtors or some or all of them simultaneously.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>“Hence, there is nothing improper in the creditor's filing of an action
against the surviving <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors alone, instead
of instituting a proceeding for the settlement of the estate of the deceased
debtor wherein his claim could be filed.” <span class="GramE">(Imperial Insurance
Inc. v. David, 133 SCRA 317 [1984]).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The choice is undoubtedly left to the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
creditor to determine against whom he will enforce collection (PNB v.
Independent Planters Association Inc., 122 SCRA 113 [1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolutions of the Court of Appeals dated
September <span style="">30, 1</span>975, November 21,
1975 and January 13, 1976 are Reversed and <span style="">Set </span>Aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
interposed by petitioner-appellant is <span class="GramE">Dismissed</span> for <span style="">lack </span>of merit and the decision of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VI dated May 28, 1974, is Affirmed <u>in
<span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>.</p>
