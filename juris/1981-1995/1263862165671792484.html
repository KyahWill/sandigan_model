upon demand, but the said accused, once in possession of the aforesaid sum and
far from complying with their aforementioned obligation, wantonly failed and
refused to do so, despite repeated demands made upon them to that effect and
the length of time that has elapsed, and with intent to defraud,
misappropriated, misapplied and converted the said amount to their own personal
use and benefit, to the damage and prejudice of the Central Bank and
Development Bank of the Philippines, in the aforesaid amount of P555,000.00,
Philippine Currency.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both accused-private respondents pleaded not guilty to the crime
charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the amount of

<p class="BODY">We rule in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 of Rule 124 of the Rules of Court defines the power of
the appellate court on appeals taken to it, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Section 11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Power of
Appellate Court on Appeal.- Upon appeal from a judgment of the Court of First
Instance, the appellate court may <u>reverse,</u> <u>affirm</u> <u>or</u> <u>modify</u>
<u>the</u> <u>judgment</u> <u>and</u> <u>increase</u> <u>or</u> <u>reduce</u> <u>the</u>

<u>retrial,</u> <u>or</u> <u>dismiss</u> <u>the</u> <u>case</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The reason behind this rule is that an appeal of a criminal case
opens its entire record for review in order to resolve not only questions of
law but also questions of facts. The Court of Appeals may thus re-examine and
re-weigh all the evidence on record and affirm, modify or reverse the findings
of facts and conclusions of the lower court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
That its findings of facts or conclusions are erroneous do not thereby deprive
it of its jurisdiction over the appealed criminal case as the mere fact that
the court decides the question wrongly is utterly immaterial to its
jurisdiction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither do these erroneous findings and conclusions render the appellate court
vulnerable to the corrective writ of <i>certiorari</i> for where the court has
jurisdiction over the case, even if its findings are not correct, they would,
at most, constitute errors of law and not an abuse of discretion correctible by
<i>certiorari</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the appeal of private respondents having been
regularly taken to the Court of Appeals, the appellate court was clothed with
the power and authority to adjudicate upon the rights and obligations of the
parties before it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, it
re-examined and re-weighed the evidence on record and came to the conclusion
that private respondents were not guilty of the crime charged as the withdrawal
of the alleged shortage was done without intent to defraud nor was damage or
prejudice caused thereby to <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Development Bank
or the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether this conclusion was based merely on
speculations and conjecture, or on a misapprehension of facts and contrary to
the documents and exhibits of the case, is not for us to determine in a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> wherein only issues of jurisdiction may be
raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither can we determine whether
the constructions given by the appellate court to a document is right or wrong as
errors in the appreciation of evidence may not be reviewed by <i>certiorari</i>
because they do not involve any jurisdictional question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The function of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> is to keep an
inferior court within the bounds of its jurisdiction or to prevent it from
committing such a grave abuse of discretion amounting to excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is available only for
these purposes and not to correct errors of procedure or mistakes in the
judge's findings or conclusions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

Thus, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>; that the court had
committed a mistake, the error does not vitiate the decision considering that
it had jurisdiction over the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The writ of <i>certiorari</i> issues for the correction of errors of
jurisdiction only or grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ of <i>certiorari</i>
cannot be legally used for any other purpose.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
If the court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, the
orders and rulings upon all questions pertaining to the cause are orders and
rulings within its jurisdiction and cannot be corrected by <i>certiorari</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, errors of judgment may be corrected in a timely
appeal from the judgment on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such remedy, however, is not available in the case at bar, the decision
involved being one of acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the People would run counter to
the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> constitutional guarantee against double
jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">We discern in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> a subtle
attempt to have us review the judgment of the appellate court on the
merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the petition at bar is
denominated special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court and the issues raised therein ostensibly dealt with the
jurisdiction of the appellate court, petitioners' attack on the appellate
court's jurisdiction is premised on the conclusions that (a) the findings of
facts of the appellate court were based on conjectures and speculations, or on
misapprehension of facts and contrary to the documents and exhibits; (b) the
exhibit relied upon by the appellate court has not been offered nor admitted in
evidence during the trial; and (c) the appellate court gave to a document a
meaning contrary to its contents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
how valid and tenable these premises are remains a question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To determine their validity would entail a
review and re-evaluation of the evidence on record as well as the procedure
taken <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the conclusions arrived at by the
appellate court; in effect, a review of the judgment of acquittal, which we
cannot do in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and without violating the private
respondents' constitutional right against double jeopardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Rule 122 of the Rules of Court provides that
"the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
cannot appeal if the defendant would be placed thereby in double
jeopardy." The argument that the judgment is tainted with grave abuse of
discretion and therefore, null and void, is flawed because whatever error may
have been committed by the lower court was merely an error of judgment and not
of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not affect the
intrinsic validity of the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is the kind of error that can no longer be rectified on appeal by the
prosecution no matter how obvious the error may be.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The rule therefore, in this jurisdiction is that a judgment of acquittal is not
<span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by a higher court, for an Appeal by the
government from the judgment would put the accused in second jeopardy for the
same offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>
