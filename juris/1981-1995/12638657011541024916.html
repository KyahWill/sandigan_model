which sustained the decision of the MTC in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>

<p class="BODY">In agreement with the trial courtsâ€™ order of dismissal of
petitioner Lim's motion for execution of the March 11, 1981 resolution in AC-G.R.
No. 44770-R, as well as his motion to include private respondents as defendants
in Civil Case No. 2953, respondent court in AC-G.R. No. 08533-CV ruled that its
decision of April 29, 1980 has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
hence beyond its power to reverse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
further ruled that since petitioner Lim thru counsel received on May 16, 1980 a
copy of the notice of judgment and a copy of the April 29, 1980 decision, under
Rule 45, he had 15 days to perfect his appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to this
Court or to file within that period a motion for reconsideration but instead of
so doing, he improperly filed a motion for extension of time to file motion for
reconsideration which was erroneously granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It concluded that the extension granted to petitioner Lim did not arrest
the running of the 15 day period; and considering that the motion for extension
of time to file motion for reconsideration is not sanctioned under the rule
laid down in <span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Japson</span>
(G.R. No. 70895, August 5, 1985, 138 SC<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">R</span>A

become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and his admission that he
filed Civil Case No. 6767 pursuant to said order imply his <span class="SpellE">comformity</span>
thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It justified the order denying
the motion to include private respondents as defendants in Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Case </span>No. 2953 stating that private

<p class="BODY">In AC-G.R. No. 12316-SP, it ruled that Lee's unjustified refusal

that he cannot deny or question the ownership of private respondents over the
lease premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also found out that
the leased premises is a commercial building and therefore excluded from the
operation of P.D. No. 20 as amended by B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25;
that the original written lease contract had expired so that his occupation of
the premises was on a month-to-month basis hence the lease was with a specific
and definite period which expires at the end of each month and therefore
outside the suspension imposed in Section 4 of PD 20 as amended by PD 25.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also affirmed the denial of petitioner
Lim's intervention in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case (Civil Case
No. 2687) by adopting its own ratiocination in A.C. G.R. No. 08533-CV regarding

</span>They claim that said resolution could not have been assailed
collaterally but only by a direct proceeding for its annulment; that the
reliance placed by respondent court in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>

<span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Japson</span> (supra)

January 27, 1987, 147 SCRA 208) and therefore said rulings cannot be applied

that the actual registration of documents affecting land constitutes the
operative act which makes the instrument evidencing the transaction valid as
against third persons and binding on the land itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They allege that the cancellation was
contrary to law because the decision in Civil Case No. 2953 did not attain
finality as it was in fact reversed by respondent court in CA G.R. No. 44770-R

<p class="BODY">They assail the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">conclusion
</span>reached by respondent court <span class="GramE">that respondents</span>
were buyers in good faith as contrary to the evidence presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that private respondents cannot be
considered as having bought Lot No. 1558 in good faith because it was only on
May 20, 1974 that a similar annotation on TCT No. 2581 was cancelled and the
sale of the lots took place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on May 28, </span>1970;
that the non-inclusion of private respondents as parties in Civil Case No. 2953

transferees <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">lite</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They assert that respondent court erred in
sustaining the erroneous decision of the trial courts which ruled on the issue
of ownership of lot no. 1557 and the building standing thereon contrary to the
principle that in <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases only the issue of
possession is determined.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners added that private respondents did not notify
petitioner Lee to vacate by reason of expiration of the lease contract but for
the reason that they are allegedly going to use the premises and that the
notice was not presented as evidence during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to them, there was no lawful demand
to vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further assert that
after the lease contract expired, the relationship of petitioner Lee and
private respondents is governed by Article 1670 of the Civil Code and therefore
the period of the lease should have been fixed by the trial courts in
accordance with Article 1687 of the same Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petitions to be impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court in a subsequent resolution in <span class="SpellE">Habaluyas</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Japson</span> (G.R. No. 70895, dated May 30, 1986, 142
SCRA 208), declared that the filing of a motion for extension of time to file
motion for new trial or reconsideration of a final order or judgment of a
Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Court, Regional Trial Court and the Court of
Appeals, is not expressly prohibited by law or the rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court clarified therein that in Gibbs v.
CFI of Manila (80 Phil 160) it was not held that a motion for extension of time
to file motion for new trial or reconsideration could not be granted and that
the Gibbs decision was cited by a division of the Court in <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Gunigundo</span> (Adm. Case No. 1664, March 30, 1979, 89
SCRA 178) merely to support a statement that such kind of motion is not in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court further stated that "the
interest of justice would be better served if the original decision were
applied prospectively" beginning <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the aforesaid
pronouncement, all previous rulings on the matter were deemed abandoned or at
least superseded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So that when
petitioner Lim filed thru registered mail on <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1980</st1:date> his motion for extension of time to file a
motion for reconsideration, the motion was deemed properly filed contrary to
respondent court's ruling that it was a prohibited pleading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion therefore suspended the running of
the period for him to appeal from the <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="4">April
 29, 1980</st1:date> decision in AC-G.R. No. 44770-R.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it must be noted that petitioner Lim
was granted by respondent court a new period (20 days) to file a motion for
reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion which he
filed barely 3 days before the expiration of the period given him was
denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of taking an appeal
after receipt of the denial, he filed a second motion for reconsideration which
was the basis of the <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1981</st1:date>
resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the second
motion is clearly contrary to Rule 52 of the Rules of Court because it was made
without leave and after the lapse of the extension granted him and also
contrary to Sec. 4 of the Interim Rules which prohibits the filing of a second
motion for reconsideration of a final order or judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But one does not have any vested right in
technicalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In meritorious cases, a liberal
not literal interpretation of the rules becomes imperative and technicalities
should not be resorted to in derogation of the intent of the rules which is the
proper and just determination of litigations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As has been the constant ruling of this
Court, every party-litigant should be afforded the amplest opportunity for the
proper and just disposition of his cause free from the constraints of
technicalities (Fonseca v. CA, G.R.

99).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, private
respondents failed to raise the issue of failure to comply with the rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their failure has the effect of a waiver
(Republic v. Judge Villanueva, G.R. No. 83333, February 2, 1989, En Banc,

<p class="BODY">The reversal made by respondent Court of its <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1980</st1:date> decision in AC-G.R. No. 44770-R
thru its <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1981</st1:date>
resolution was the result of a thorough deliberation and evaluation of the
evidence of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court takes
cognizance of the fact that private respondents were directed to comment on the
second motion for reconsideration and after they filed one, the motion was
calendared for hearing (Resolution in AC-G.R. No. 44770-R dated September 10,
1980), after which respondent court, taking a hard look at the evidence, found
out that one of the partners of LAHCO (Francisco <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
Cheng Co) used to live with the family of petitioner Lim and after the death of
his foster parents said partner became the <span class="SpellE"><u>encargado</u></span>
of the lots in question so that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>such
capacity he knew of the heirs of the lots as petitioner usually demanded from
him his share from the rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
properly ruled that LAHCO <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>not
a buyer in good faith and since petitioner never executed in favor of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his brother, </span>any deed of conveyance
waiving his 3/14 interest in the properties in question, the document he signed
entrusting to his brother his two (2) children with his common law wife and
also the monthly income he was receiving from him for his children's support,
cannot be considered as renunciation of his interest but merely an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">assignment </span>of the income earned by
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court also doubted the
testimony of Cherry Lim that petitioner Lim knew of the sale as she heard them
talking about it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Respondent
court noting that, although said witness understood Chinese language, she did
not know how to speak the same so that when the petitioner Lim and his brother
were conversing, they could have spoken purely in Chinese and it is doubtful if
said witness fully understood what they were talking about.</span></p>

resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1981</st1:date>
in AC-G.R. No. 44770-R could not be collaterally attacked both in Civil Case
No. 2687 and in the appeal from the decision in Civil Case 2953.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The nature of the resolution is such that it
is entirely regular in form as the defect was procedural which is not apparent
on its face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the only cognizable
remedy against it is the filing of an independent action or proceeding to
vacate or have it set aside (<span class="SpellE">Banco</span> <span class="SpellE">Espanol</span> Filipino v. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, 37

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it was error for respondent court to have

<p class="BODY">Thus, there was no reversible error committed by respondent court
in affirming the denial of petitioner Lim's motion to include respondents as

sanctioned under the rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is why
the trial court reserved for petitioner Lim, thru its order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1982</st1:date>, the right to file an
action to determine once and for all the validity of the acquisition of the
lots by respondents and he exercised it by filing Civil Case No. 6767 which is
