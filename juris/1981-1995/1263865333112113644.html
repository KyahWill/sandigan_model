Cruz, Jr. objected thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 8, 1988, Acting Mayor Santos and De Guzman filed a

the Department of Local Government, for having unlawfully conspired and
confederated with each other to prevent de Guzman from attending and
participating in the sessions of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> to deprive de Guzman of his rights and privileges

Administrative Case No. <span class="GramE">M-1035-88.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that the appointment of De Guzman is illegal

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no law prescribing the appointment
of <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives;</p>

power to fill permanent vacancies in the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> but at the time of de Guzman's designation, no such
vacancy existed because all ten (10) seats therein, set by Republic Act No.
6636 (which rescheduled local election from November 9, 1987 to January 18,
1988) were all filled up by its ten (10) incumbent members after the January

Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337,

</span>The said Resolution was recalled by the Resolution of <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1985</st1:date>, but was

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span>

Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, the petitioners by a letter dated <st1:date year="1989" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1989</st1:date> informed the Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City, thru the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>

of <span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span> City adopted on March 2, 1989 Resolution
No. 70 declining to recognize the designations of petitioners on the ground
that such designations have not complied with the conditions precedent
prescribed by the Local Government Code (BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337)
and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Rule XVI, Sec. 4, par. C)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>And, when the City Mayor

unanimously approved on <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1989</st1:date>
Resolution No. 92 to override the Mayor's veto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, the petitioners sought the intervention of the
Secretary of the Department of Local Government who in his 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated March 10, 1989 referred to the Presiding
Officer of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlungsod</span>
petitioners' letter of even date and directing that unless there are legal
reasons to the contrary, to allow them to participate in the deliberations of
that body as duly appointed members thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the Presiding Officers of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>

dated <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1989</st1:date>
informed the Secretary of the Department of Local Government that while
Resolution No. 70 remains in effect, he is powerless to recognize petitioners'

<p class="BODY">The Secretary in his letter of <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1989</st1:date> reiterated compliance with his instruction

the Secretary of the Department of Local Government issued a Memorandum

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1989</st1:date>,
the City Council of Angeles City approved, by a majority vote, Resolution No.
33, S-89 affirming the sufficiency of members of the agricultural sector in the
city that warrants the appointment of a representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City Council having already determined the necessity of a
representative, Mayor Antonio <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos in his
letter dated <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1989</st1:date>
to the Presiding Officer and Members of the City Council, introduced for
recognition Mr. Antonio B. Gomez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners objected to the designation on the ground that Gomez
was a defeated candidate for councilor in the last election in Angeles City and
is publicly known as engaged in the trade of repairing air-conditioning units
and refrigerators but never has he been engaged in farming or in livestock
raising or in agricultural work or trade involving agriculture and the like,
nor has he been known or identified to work for the interest or plight of
agricultural workers, therefore, he is not competent and qualified to represent
the agricultural sector.</p>

<p class="BODY">To forestall the assumption of office of said Antonio Gomez,
herein petitioners filed with the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>

a complaint for "Injunction with prayer for a restraining order."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on two (2) grounds,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the complaint states no
cause of action and that petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the said motion, the trial court dismissed the case
"solely on the ground of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies."
(p. 53 <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant <span class="GramE">petition for review with
prayer for a restraining order</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 11, 1989, the Court issued a temporary restraining order
"effective immediately and continuing until further orders from this

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1989</st1:date>,
the Council debated and voted on whether to recognize and accept the
appointments of petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of thirty
(30) members present, eighteen (18) voted against while twelve (12) were in
favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this result, the
Council refused to recognize and accept petitioners' appointments and barred
their entry into the session hall.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i>
under Sections 2 and 3 respectively of Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners seek the enjoinment
and performance of the following acts, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To enjoin respondents from debating and
deliberating on the legality and validity of the appointment of petitioners as <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives to the City Council of Manila;</blockquote>

respondents to recognize petitioners as the duly appointed <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
representatives to the City Council of Manila and to allow them to participate
in the deliberations of the council in such capacity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners maintain that their appointments are legal and valid
since they conform to Section 9, Art. X of the Constitution which provides for <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representation in legislative bodies of local
governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, petitioners assert
that Section 7, Act, XVIII of the Constitution empowers the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to "fill by appointment from a list of nominees by the respective sectors
the seats reserved for <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representation in
par. (2) Section 5 of Art. VI . . ." And since the Secretary of the
Department of Local Government is duly authorized to issue appointments under
Executive Order No. 342 dated November 18, 1988, then, perforce petitioners'
appointments which were issued under such lawful authority are legal, valid and
binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, therefore,
conclude that it is ministerial on the part of respondents to recognize and
accept their appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, in the aforementioned cases, although pursuing
different remedies, center their attack on the authority of the Secretary of
Local Government to designate/appoint members/<span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
representatives to the local legislative bodies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners argue that:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) The designations/appointments made by respondent Secretary is
unlawful and unconstitutional in the light of Article X, Section 9 of the 1987

<blockquote>"Legislative bodies of local government shall have <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representation as may be prescribed by law."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">(4) That the appointees are not qualified.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>DISCUSSION</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 9 Article X of the 1973 Constitution mandates that
legislative bodies of local governments shall have <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span>
representation as may be prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Local Government Code (BP 337), the power to appoint <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives is conferred upon the President of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the Secretary of Local Government may, by authority of the President
inform the <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives of their
appointments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, it is
actually the President who has made the appointments in the cases involved
herein, and the Secretary of Local Government is only the transmitter or communicator
of said appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The composition of the local legislative body for the cities is
governed by Section 3, paragraph 1 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 51 (An Act Providing for the Elective or Appointive
Positions in various Local Governments and for other Purposes) –</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cities - There shall be in each city such

sectors are of sufficient number in the city to warrant representation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provision of law is
complemented by Section 173 of the Local Government Code (B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337) which provides that:</p>

said sectors are of sufficient number in the city to warrant representation,
after consultation with associations and persons belonging to the sector
concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the local legislative body for the
municipalities is provided for in Section 146 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.

eight members elected at large, and the members <span class="GramE">appointed</span>
by the President consisting of the president of the <span class="SpellE"><u>katipunang</u></span>

whenever, as determined by the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, said sectors are of sufficient number in the
municipality to warrant representation, after consultation with associations
and persons belonging to the sector concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But can the President or the Secretary of the Department of Local
Government make the designation/appointment without any enabling law pursuant
to Section 9, Article X of the 1973 Constitution?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners argue that this cannot be
done.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to petitioners' theory, the phrase "as may be prescribed
by law" is not prospective in character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 9 commands that all legislative bodies of local governments must
have <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives among its members, and
the appointment or designation of individuals thereto must be done in
accordance with provisions of law, whether that law exists or has still to be
passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in this case that law
already exists in B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337 particularly Sections
146 and 173 quoted earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that the word "may" is an auxiliary
verb showing, among others, opportunity or possibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under ordinary circumstances, the phrase
"may be" implies the possible existence of something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Capati</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 113 SCRA 794, 796)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the "something" is a law governing <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The phrase in question should, therefore, be understood to mean as
prescribed by such law that governs the matter at the time this Constitution is
ratified or that could be enacted thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The phrase does not and cannot, by its very wording, restrict itself to
the uncertainty of future legislation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This interpretation would defeat the very purpose of immediately including
<span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives in the law?making
bodies of local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
in the <span class="SpellE"><u>interreqnum</u></span>, from the ratification of
the Constitution until the passage of the appropriate statute, a large and
important segment of the municipalities, the <span class="SpellE">barangays</span>,
the youth sectors, the industrial and agricultural labor sectors would have no
voice in the formulation of legislation that would directly affect their
individual members.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337 is still
operative, even after the ratification of the 1987 Constitution, because the
Transitory Provisions (Article XVIII) provides for the continued operation of
all existing laws, etc. not inconsistent with it -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 3.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>All existing laws, decrees, executives
orders, proclamations, letters of instructions and other executive issuances
not inconsistent with this Constitution shall remain operative until amended,
repealed or revoked."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>337 is not inconsistent with the 1987 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has it been expressly or impliedly
amended, repealed or revoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
therefore, it is still in effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Reyes
v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>, 156 SCRA 314, 318)</p>

<p class="BODY">The other argument of petitioners is - assuming the Secretary of
the Department of Local Government has the power to designate/appoint such <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives, still the designations made by
respondent Secretary for members to represent the Industrial and Labor Sectors
are null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>
as they were not made in the manner required by the same law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337 explicitly requires that
before the President (or the Secretary of the Department of Local Government)
may appoint members of the local legislative bodies to represent the Industrial
and Agricultural Labor Sectors, there must be a determination to be made by the
<span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span> itself that said sectors are of sufficient
number in the city or municipality to warrant representation after consultation
with associations and persons belonging to the sector concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">For that matter, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Local Government Code even prescribe the time and manner by which such
determination is to be conducted by the <span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 4(c), Rule XVI of said Rules
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Unless otherwise provided by law, the election/appointment of
representatives of the agricultural and industrial labor sectors of the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlungsod</span> or <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">bayan</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> shall be in accordance with the following guidelines
issued by the Ministry (now Secretary) of Local Government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within thirty (30) days after the first
regular session of the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> following the
election of the members, the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlungsod</span> or <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">bayan</span> shall determine if any or both agricultural and
industrial labor sectors exist and, if so, whether they are sufficient in
number as to warrant representation in the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If representation is warranted, the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> concerned shall, within a reasonable time
thereafter, call the members of the sectors for consultation which shall be
held not earlier than ten (10) days after written notice thereof has been made
to the members, either in the form of individual service or proper posting in
the city/municipal hall, in the public market and in at least three (3)
conspicuous places in the locality which are usually frequented by and/or
accessible to residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date and
time set in the notice, the members of said sectors shall be convened and they
shall choose among themselves by consensus three (3) <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>
of each sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If representation is not
warranted, the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> concerned shall, in a
resolution inform the Minister (now Secretary) of Local Government to that
effect."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in cases where the <span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span>
concerned has not yet determined that the Industrial and Agricultural Labor
Sectors in their particular city or municipality are of sufficient number to
warrant representation, there will absolutely be no basis for the designations/
appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, in this regard, the Office of the Solicitor
General in a Manifestation and Motion dated <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1989</st1:date> took the view that as a general rule,
such prior determination by the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> itself is
a condition <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u> to a valid appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of qualification of the appointee, <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled in the cases of Ignacio v. <span class="SpellE">Banate</span>,
Jr. and Reyes v. <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span> (supra) that the appointee to
the <span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span> who sits there as a representative
must meet the qualifications required by law for the position.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution does not prescribe the qualifications for the
position of <span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representatives (for the
Industrial and Agricultural Sectors) to the local legislative bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the use of the term "<span class="SpellE">sectoral</span> representation" implies that the person to be
appointed must possess the necessary qualifications to represent that particular
sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the very least, the appointee
must actually belong to the sector which he purports to <span class="GramE">represent,</span>
otherwise there can be no true representation.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the appointee must belong to the sector which he seeks to
represent is further made clear in Sections 146 and 173 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 337 which require a determination by the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> that the agricultural and industrial labor
sectors are of sufficient number to warrant representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the process of such inquiry the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> is enjoined by law to consult with associations
and persons belonging to the sector concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consultation with the sector concerned is made a prerequisite
considering that those who belong to said sector are the ones primarily
interested in being represented in the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span class="GramE">is,</span> therefore,
quite obvious that the person appointed as such representative must actually

<p class="BODY">Finally, anent the contention of some of the petitioners that there
was failure to exhaust administrative <span class="GramE">remedies,</span>
suffice it to state that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies
is not an inflexible rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it
yields <span class="GramE">to</span> many accepted exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhaustion is not necessary where <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> there is <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
on the part of the party invoking the doctrine; where the challenged
administrative act is patently illegal, amounting to lack of jurisdiction;
where there is unreasonable delay or official inaction that will irretrievably
prejudice the complainant; where the amount involved is relatively small so as
to make the rule impractical and oppressive; and where the question involved is
purely legal and will ultimately have to be decided anyway by the courts of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rocamora</span>
v. RTC - <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>, Branch VIII,
167 SCRA 615-623)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
non-exhaustion of administrative remedies is also not applicable to a case of a
department secretary whose acts as an <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of the President
bear the implied or assumed approval of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bertulata</span> v. Peralta,
Jr. 59 SCRA 7)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The cases at bar fall within the exception.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As can be gleaned from the above discussions,
the other questions involved in these cases are purely legal and will
ultimately have to be decided by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But most importantly, what is being questioned is the power and
authority delegated to the Secretary of the Department of Local Government by
the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely then, an appeal
and/or review to the executive head, in this case, the Office of the President
will definitely be impractical, not feasible and a mere exercise in futility.</p>
