follows:</p>

the offended party Melinda <span class="SpellE">Cuaresma</span>, against her will
and consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Record, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 2.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment held on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="4">April
 30, 1986</st1:date>, appellant pleaded not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, trial proceeded until terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime before 7 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the morning of January 14, 1986,
complainant Melinda <span class="SpellE">Cuaresma</span> was requested by her
stepfather, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span>, to gather fern tops
across the <span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span> River [TSN, December 5, 1986, p.
13], at a fern grove located within a banana plantation [TSN, November 5, 1986,
pp. 13-14.] While gathering the fern tops, she met appellant who asked her
whether she had seen his female <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she answered in the negative, she saw
him leave for the farm of her Ka <span class="SpellE">Francing</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she proceeded to gather fern tops,
however, she noticed appellant following her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He asked her then what she was going to do with the fern tops and she
answered that she was going to cook them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As she continued to gather fern tops, appellant embraced her and forced
her to lie down <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span>the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant shouted for help but
was warned by appellant to shut up otherwise he would kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With her right hand being held by appellant,
complainant held on to her panty with her left hand; however, because he was
definitely stronger, appellant was able to remove the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, now in a kneeling position,
thereafter pulled down his short pants [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 14-16, 24.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant tried to free herself by kicking and boxing him but
to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant succeeded in
having carnal knowledge of complainant [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 16-17, 24.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Managing to free herself from appellant, complainant ran and
crossed the river towards her home [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1986</st1:date>, p. 17.] Her mother, <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span>, heard her cry "<span class="SpellE">Inay</span>,
<span class="SpellE">inay</span>" [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1986</st1:date>, p. 4.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span>
saw complainant fall on the bank of the river, some fifty (50) meters from
their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When her daughter stood up,
she met the latter at their yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
her inquiry, complainant said that she was raped by appellant [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 5-6.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span>
brought her daughter to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Councilman <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Populi</span> who referred them
to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Puras</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter in
turn directed them to go to the Police Station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the station, their statements were taken and complainant was told to
subject herself to a medical examination [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1986</st1:date>, pp. 6-9; <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1986</st1:date>, p. 20.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical certificate issued by Dr. Arturo Alberto who on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1986</st1:date> conducted the
medical examination on complainant, contained the following findings:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant sought to establish the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time of the alleged incident, he was already at work as a
laborer in the construction of the <span class="SpellE">Bisay</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> Bridge at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, San <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He first learned that he was being charged
with the crime of rape of complainant on <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1986</st1:date> when his cousin<span class="GramE">,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Albarillo</span>, personally fetched him from his place of
work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon learning of such charge, he
went back to <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span> at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 a.m.</st1:time> of the same day to verify
from his mother the truth of such report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She, however, denied having any knowledge about the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2
 p.m.</st1:time> of that day, he was fetched by a policeman and brought to the
Municipal Building of San <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> where he was
thereafter detained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No statement was
taken from him [TSN, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1988</st1:date>,
pp. 4-7.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1988</st1:date>, the Regional Trial Court of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
Branch XXXIX, found appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable
doubt, as principal, of the crime of rape, defined and penalized in Article 335
of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the offended party in the
amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> by way of actual, compensatory
and moral damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to
pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ultimately, the only issue is whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">or </span>not appellant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of rape.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Owing to the peculiar nature of the crime of rape, the very act
itself is oftentimes, as in this case, witnessed by only two people, the
complainant and the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>consequence, extreme care and
caution is required in weighing and appraising their conflicting testimonies to
ensure that justice is meted out [People v. <span class="SpellE">Villapana</span>,
G.R. No. 53984, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1988</st1:date>,
161 SCRA 72.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave credence to the prosecution's evidence
consisting mainly of the testimony of the complainant as corroborated by the
findings of Dr. Arturo Alberto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found
that complainant, an unsophisticated barrio lass and barely 15 years old at the
time of the incident in question, would have no reason to tell a sordid tale of
violation by a man unless such was the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court has consistently held that conclusions as to the credibility
of witnesses in rape cases lie heavily on the sound judgment of the trial
court, for it is the court which has observed the behavior and deportment of
the witnesses [People v. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-38551-53, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 27, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 148 SCRA
60; People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarda</span>, G.R. No. 74479, </span><st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 24, 1989</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 172 SCRA 651.]</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given
the following considerations, we find no reason to depart from this rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of complainant's testimony will show the candor
expected of a girl truthfully recounting the terrible experience which had
befallen her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her account of the events
which occurred before, during and after the rape was consistent and unwavering
even during cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More
importantly, that she put up a struggle against the appellant so she could free
herself is consistent with the injuries she suffered as a result thereof, as
shown in the medical certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, complainant's behavior immediately after the incident
establishes beyond reasonable doubt that she was raped by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accompanied by her mother, she lost no time
in reporting the incident to the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The policemen who interviewed her regarding the incident noted that she
was pale and trembling and her clothes were wet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was also crying and was unable to speak
so she was advised to first rest and calm down [TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1987</st1:date>, pp. 7-8, 18.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This condition in which complainant was found
is an added basis for the finding that she was all the while telling the truth.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">II.</span></span><span style="font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To raise doubt that rape was indeed committed on Melinda,
appellant relies upon the testimony of his expert witness, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Mariefreda</span> <span class="SpellE">Madla</span>, to the effect
that contusions and <span class="SpellE">hematomas</span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>be due to pre-menstrual irregularities [TSN, February 3, 1988,
pp. 13-16] and that the hymen of a woman <u>may</u> be broken from causes like
biking, running or masturbation or in the course of examination of a physician
[TSN, February 3, 1988, pp. 16-19.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Madla's</span> testimony deserves scant consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since she did not personally examine
complainant, but expressed her views on the findings in the medical
certificate, her testimony amounts to no more than a theoretical assessment
which cannot overcome the findings and testimony of Dr. Alberto who actually
examined the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, the totality of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Madla's</span> testimony even
corroborates Dr. Alberto's conclusion for it does not discount the probability
that complainant's injuries, particularly the laceration of her hymen, was
caused by intercourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant likewise capitalizes on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Puras</span>, a witness for the prosecution, to bolster his
defense of denial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
testimony of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Puras</span> is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1986</st1:date>, will

farming sometime on January 14, 1986 and thereat they lodged a complaint
regarding or, in connection with what happened to her daughter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
was, in particular, the complaint of mother and daughter <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span> and Melinda <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cuaresma</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Please tell the Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span> approached me
and complained to me that <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Albarillo</span> <u>wanted</u> <u>to</u> <u>rape</u> her daughter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what else did the mother and daughter report to you <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They told me that <u>had</u> <u>it</u>

</span>[TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1987</st1:date>,
pp. 4-5.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This testimony in isolation does not lend support to appellant's
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not enough to overturn the
other evidence for the prosecution strongly pointing to the guilt of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What must be underscored is
complainant's credible testimony that she was violated by accused against her
will and without her consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any
case, it is not difficult to explain why <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Saramusing</span>, faced with the rape of her daughter and intent
on seeking redress for the wrong done to her, could have made some inaccurate
statements in this wise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant moreover insists that he could not have raped
complainant since on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1986</st1:date>
when this was allegedly committed, he was working as a construction laborer on
the <span class="SpellE">Bisay</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> Bridge at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>, San <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
presented the daily time sheets of his employer from <st1:date year="1986" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1986</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1986</st1:date> to prove that he reported for work on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, he presented the testimonies of
the project engineer and three of his co-workers to the effect that these daily
time records were prepared before actual work started at seven o'clock in the
morning and that the workers were allowed to sign only before 7:10 or 7:15
o'clock in the morning, to prove that appellant was already at work at the time
the rape was allegedly committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, alibi is a weak defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to be given full faith and credit,
it must be clearly established and must not leave any room for doubt as to its
plausibility and verity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
must show, not only that he was not at the place where the crime was committed
but that it was impossible for him to be there [People v. <span class="SpellE">Tuando</span>,
G.R. <span class="GramE">No</span>. L-47720, <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1987</st1:date>, 150 SCRA 8; People v. Lucas, G.R. No. 80102,
<st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1990</st1:date>.] That
appellant failed to satisfy the above requirements can be shown by the
following considerations:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span> who was the foreman,
the time keeper and the project engineer of the <span class="SpellE">Bisay</span>-an
Bridge project during the period of employment of appellant, claims that a
worker who arrives later than 7:15 o'clock in the morning of each working day
will not anymore be allowed to sign on the daily time sheet and hence will be
absented from work for that period [TSN, September 17, 1987, pp. 11-12.] It
bears emphasis however that no matter how vigilant Engineer <span class="SpellE">Rotone</span>
might be in taking note of the times of arrival of his workers, he admits that
owing to the nature of his work, he has to leave the job site sometimes during
working days [TSN, September 17, 1987, p. 23] and the signing of the daily time
record has to be entrusted to Mr. Teddy <span class="SpellE">Gasco</span> [TSN,
September 17, 1987, p. 22.] Contrary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">to </span>his
allegations, therefore, he is not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>always
around to personally check on his workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It also follows that a worker's late arrival for work, specifically after
7:15 o'clock in the morning of a working day according to appellant's
witnesses, will go unnoticed and enable him to sign his name on the daily time
sheet.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The basis for Engineer <span class="SpellE">Rotone's</span>
categorical statement that appellant was already at work at the time of the
alleged rape is that appellant signed up for the morning session as shown by
the <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1986</st1:date> daily
time sheet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it must be noted
that the daily time sheets alluded to are merely sheets of yellow pad paper
containing spaces where the workers sign their names if and when they report
for work in the morning and again, in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Noticeably, these do not indicate the times
when the workers arrive for work or when they leave after work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant could have signed his name on the
daily time sheet despite his being late for work.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Calsapa</span> where the
rape was perpetrated and <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>
where appellant asserts he was working at the time of the alleged rape is only
approximately seven (7) kilometers apart [Decision, p. 3; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p.16.] Appellant testified that when he goes to his place of work from his
house in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span>, he
has to cross first the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> and then take the tricycle in
<span class="SpellE">Calsapa</span> [TSN, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="1">January
 5, 1988</st1:date>, p. 20] which stops at the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>
of San <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> [TSN, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1988</st1:date>, p. 24.] He has then to negotiate about
two kilometers from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Bisay</span>-<span class="GramE">an</span> Bridge [TSN, <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1988</st1:date>, p. 25.] Admittedly,
the crime scene can be passed by appellant from his house in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span>, where he and
complainant are neighbors, en route to his place of work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The distance between the crime scene and
appellant's place of work can be negotiated in a span of time so as to be
consistent with the theory that after raping complainant in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ibuye</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Calsapa</span>, appellant then proceeded to work in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it has been ruled that the defense
of alibi cannot be believed where t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">h</span>e
distance of two (2) barrios is only eight (8) kilometers and can be traversed
by walking in one and a half hours [People v. <span class="SpellE">Ausan</span>,

<p class="BODY">The Court notes the futile attempts of appellant to impute
several motives on the part of complainant's family to implicate him in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He tried to show that there was a
long-standing feud between his family and the family of complainant because
complainant's family have frequently trespassed on their premises (the banana
plantation and the fern grove where complainant gathered the fern tops were
being tenanted by Josefina <span class="SpellE">Albarillo</span>, the mother of
appellant) and gathered vegetables without their consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also attempted to make it appear that the
mother of complainant had a reason to be angry against his family since his
mother Josefina accused her of not having remitted to the insurance company
about P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in insurance premiums paid to her as
an insurance agent.</p>

<p class="BODY">That a mother would use her daughter and subject <span class="GramE">her</span> to the shame of admitting that she had been raped so
that she could seek vengeance on the son of a woman against whom she harbors a
grudge does not merit consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is difficult to believe that a young, unmarried woman would tell a story of
defloration, allow the examination of her private parts and thereafter permit
herself to be the subject of a public trial, if she was not motivated by an
honest desire to seek justice [People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>,
