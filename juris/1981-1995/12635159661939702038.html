				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In four (4) separate Informations filed in Criminal Cases Nos. 13517, 13518, 13519 and 13520, petitioner Ponciano Layug was charged with the crime of Estafa through Falsification of Public Documents as defined and penalized under Articles 315 and 171 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>The Informations are phrased in substantially identical language and differ from each other only as to particulars referring to dates of the commission of the offense and amounts involved.&nbsp; They charge the accused (herein petitioner) of falsifying his daily time records (DTRs) for the months of January, February, March and April 1986 by making it appear therein that he performed his assigned work as Guidance Counselor in the Davao del Sur National High School during the dates shown in said daily time records, thereby enabling him to collect and receive his corresponding salaries for the said months, when in truth and in fact, said accused did not actually perform his duties and functions as Guidance Counselor for the said periods.<br><br>A warrant for petitioner's arrest was issued on 9 May 1989 which was referred on 26 May 1989 to the National Bureau of Investigation for implementation.&nbsp; However, it appears that on 17 May 1989, petitioner voluntarily surrendered and posted his bail bond with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 18, Digos, Davao del Sur.&nbsp; Upon arraignment on 21 July 1989, petitioner entered a plea of not guilty to all the charges against him.<br><br>After joint trial of the cases, the Sandiganbayan<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> found petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.&nbsp; The dispositive part of its decision dated 31 January 1991 reads as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, accused Ponciano M. Layug is hereby declared GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of Estafa Thru Falsification of Public Documents defined and penalized under Articles 315 and 171 in relation to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code in Crim. Case Nos. 13517, 13518, 13519 and 13520.&nbsp; Appreciating in his favor the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, he is hereby sentenced to suffer, for each case, an indeterminate penalty ranging from TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of prision correcional as minimum to TEN (10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of prision mayor as maximum; to pay a fine of P2,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; to indemnify the government of the Republic of the Philippines in the amount of P612.80 in Crim. Case No. 13517, P421.30 in Crim. Case No. 13518, P229.80 in Crim. Case No. 13519 and P153.20 in Crim. Case No. 13520; and to pay the costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration filed on 15 February 1995 was denied on 23 February 1995 for lack of merit.<br><br>In the present petition for review, petitioner Layug assails the Sandiganbayan's decision as contrary to law and not substantiated by the evidence on record.<br><br>Petitioner contends that Exhibit "L",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> on which the Sandiganbayan based mainly its judgment of conviction, is not a credible record of his attendance in the Guidance Office for the periods involved in the charges.<br><br>Petitioner avers that the entries in said Exhibit "L" are mere fabrications and not factual. He cites in particular the testimony of Mrs. Lizbeth Sur, Guidance Counselor, who testified that she made a daily record of petitioner's attendance at the Guidance Office.&nbsp; She declared:<br><br><blockquote><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"JUSTICE BALAJADIA </td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">When you monitored the arrival of Mr. Layug you assumed that when he arrived at his desk that was the time he arrived in the office.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">When he reported at the Guidance Office.</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2" valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">JUSTICE BALAJADIA</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">Q </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">That was the time when you recorded it?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">A </div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY">You did not determine first whether he passed by the library before reporting to his desk.

She was emphatic in her testimony that she was never absent from January to April 1986, personally entering the data on daily attendance of Layug for the said period.&nbsp; Yet, she recorded supposed absences of petitioner even during holidays or non-working days, particularly in January and February 1986. Exhibit "L" cannot thus be considered a credible record of petitioner's attendance in the Guidance office for the period involved therein.<br><br>The Court likewise rejects Mr. Presto's posture that he signed the inaccurate or false daily time records (DTRs) of petitioner in good faith.&nbsp; As early as January 1986, he had received information about Layug's attendance. It is unthinkable that despite his knowledge of the alleged irregular attendance of petitioner, he did not take extra care to segregate and scrutinize petitioner's DTRs starting in January 1986 so as to give himself (Presto) justification not to sign the same. Likewise, if he were diligent and serious enough about pursuing the subject of his memorandum to the department head, he would not have signed the daily time records without her initials.<br><br>We do not agree with respondent court that the signature/approval by the principal of petitioner's DTRs is completely irrelevant and immaterial.&nbsp; Without the said signature of the principal, petitioner could not have collected or received his salaries for the corresponding months.&nbsp; If petitioner did not receive his salaries, no damage and prejudice could have been caused the government.<br><br>For evidence to be believed, it is basic that it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness; it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Respondent court found the evidence for the defense not convincing as it was not corroborated by other witnesses.&nbsp; Although the evidence for the defense is weak, criminal conviction must come from the strength of the prosecution's evidence and not from the weakness of the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>After a thorough review of the evidence and the records, it is the Court's conclusion that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of petitioner beyond reasonable doubt.&nbsp; The evidence presented by the prosecution is not sufficiently reliable and convincing so as to overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.&nbsp; The crime charged has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt or with moral certainty.&nbsp; Hence, petitioner must be acquitted.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of all the foregoing, the judgment of the Sandiganbayan convicting the petitioner herein is REVERSED<b> </b>and SET ASIDE.&nbsp; No pronouncement as to costs. <br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Davide, Jr., Bellosillo,</i> and <i>Kapunan, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Quiason, J.,</i> on official leave. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> First Division, Justice Minita V.
