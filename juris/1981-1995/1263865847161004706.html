				<H3>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES (PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT), PETITIONER, VS. THE HON. SANDIGANBAYAN, JOSE L. AFRICA AND MANUEL H. NIETO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition questions the order of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to place cash dividends due the Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc.
(ETPI) Class "A" stockholders in the amount of ONE HUNDRED TWENTY
MILLION PESOS (P120,000,000.00) turned over by ETPI to the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG) under a special time deposit with the
Philippine National Bank (PNB) for the account of SANDIGANBAYAN in escrow for
the person or persons, natural or juridical, who shall be adjudged lawfully
entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March 1986, the petitioner PCGG sequestered
ETPI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sequestration order was
partially lifted in May 1986 when 40% of the shares of stock (Class
"B") were freed from the effects of sequestration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining 60% (Class "A")
shares, however, continued to be under sequestration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1987</st1:date>,
the PCGG filed with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> a complaint for
<span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, reversion, accounting, and restitution
of the alleged ill-gotten ETPI shares and damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 0009.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1988 respondents Jose L. Africa and Manuel H.
Nieto, Jr., for themselves and in behalf of all other ETPI Class "A"
stockholders filed with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> a joint
motion to direct PCGG to remit to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
the P90 million cash dividends of Class "A" stockholders turned over
by ETPI President Eduardo M. Villanueva to the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated September 15, 1988, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
ordered, among others, the PCGG to remit to the Court the subject P90 million
cash dividends and for the Clerk of Court to deposit the said amount under
special time deposit with the PNB for the account of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in escrow for the person or persons, natural or juridical, who would be
adjudged lawfully entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1988</st1:date>,
the PCGG filed a manifestation and motion to set aside the <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1988</st1:date> resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It manifested that as regards the joint
motion, <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> acquiescence to the placing of the
ETPI dividends with the PNB in a time deposit was under the condition that no
government regulation should be violated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under its interpretation of the rules and regulations implementing
sequestration however, the PCGG asserted that the custody of the subject
dividends should be with the PCGG and the funds should be deposited in its name
to be held in escrow for the person or persons, natural or juridical, <span class="GramE">who</span> may be formally adjudged lawfully entitled thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, ETPI turned over another P30<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>
cash dividends pertaining to ETPI Class "A" stockholders to the
PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted the private
respondents to file another joint motion to direct PCGG to remit the P30<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the manifestation and motion of PCGG, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1988</st1:date> denied the same for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In another resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1988</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
granted the joint motion filed by the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"In line with the aforesaid resolution of November 2, 1988,
and for the reasons therein given, the joint motion is hereby granted and the
chairman of the PCGG, or whoever is acting in his stead, is hereby ordered to
remit to the court within fifteen (15) days from notice hereof, the Thirty
million Pesos (P30,000,000.00) cash dividends due to the ETPI Class
"A" stockholders turned over by ETPI to PCGG on September 13, 1988,
for the said dividends to be similarly placed under special time deposit with
the Philippine National Bank for the account of SANDIGANBAYAN in escrow for the
person or persons, natural or juridical, who shall be adjudged lawfully
entitled thereto." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG now assails the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
resolutions which ordered the PCGG to remit the total amount of P120<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> ETPI cash dividends to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to be deposited with the PNB in <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> name
pending the determination of the true owners thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG insists that under its authority to sequester ill-gotten
properties envisioned in Executive Orders Numbered 1, 2 and 14 and pursuant to
its implementing rules and regulations, the sequestered properties remain in
its custody during and until such time that the true ownership <span class="GramE">over</span> the sequestered shares has been finally
determined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It argues that such custody
and control of the properties do not end upon the filing of the corresponding
sequestration case with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it argues that its
administrative functions over the properties must be distinguished from the
judicial jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PCGG contends that its administrative
jurisdiction over the subject dividends must remain with the PCGG even after
the filing of the sequestration case in order to administer said dividends and
such administrative function cannot be interfered with by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> otherwise there would be a violation of the
constitutional principle of "separation of powers" between the
executive/administrative and the judicial functions of Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG claims that its arguments are based
on principles allegedly laid down in the cases of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bataan</u></span>
<u>Shipyard</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Engineering</u> <u>Co</u>., <u>Inc</u>. <u>v</u>.
<u>Presidential</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Good</u> <u>Government</u>,
150 SCRA 181 [1987] (hereafter referred to as BASECO case) and <u>Presidential</u>
<u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Good</u> <u>Government</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Peña</u></span>, 159 SCRA 555 [1988] (hereafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> case).</p>

<p class="BODY">To resolve the issue at hand we reiterate the nature and extent
of the powers of the PCGG in cases of sequestration of alleged ill-gotten
properties as well as the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
over sequestration cases filed before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> role on the
sequestered properties, we said in the <u>BASECO</u> case:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b. Need of Provisional Measures to Collect and Conserve
Assets Pending Suits</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nor may it be gainsaid that pending the institution of the suits for
the recovery of such ‘ill-gotten wealth’ as the evidence at hand may reveal,
there is an obvious and imperative need for preliminary, provisional measures
to prevent the concealment, disappearance, destruction, dissipation, or loss of
the assets and properties subject of the suits, or to restrain or foil acts
that may render moot and academic, or effectively hamper, delay, or negate
efforts to recover the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7. Provisional Remedies Prescribed by Law</blockquote>

<blockquote>To answer this need, the law has prescribed three (3) provisional
remedies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) sequestration; (2) freeze orders; and (3)
provisional takeover.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sequestration and freezing are remedies applicable generally to
unearthed instances of 'ill-gotten wealth.' xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>a. Sequestration</blockquote>

<blockquote>By the clear terms of the laws, the power of the PCGG <u>to</u> <u>sequester</u>
<u>property</u> claimed to be 'ill-gotten' means to place or cause to be placed
under its possession or control said property, or any building or office
wherein any such property and any records pertaining thereto may be found,
including ‘business enterprises and entities,’ - for the purpose of preventing
the destruction, concealment or dissipation of, and otherwise conserving and
preserving, the same - until it can be determined, through appropriate judicial
proceedings, whether the property was in truth 'ill-gotten,' i.e., acquired
through or as a result of improper or illegal use of or the conversion of funds
belonging to the Government or any of its branches, instrumentalities,
enterprises, banks or financial institutions, or by taking undue advantage of
official position, authority, relationship, connection or influence, resulting
in unjust enrichment of the ostensible owner and grave damage and prejudice to
the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Except for the statement as
to the duration of the writ of sequestration, this is substantially the
definition of sequestration set out in Section 1 (B) of the Rules and
Regulations of the PCGG (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 195-196).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term used in the Revised Anti-Subversion
Law, (P.D. No. 885, to mean ‘the seizure of private property or assets in the
hands of any person or entity in order to prevent the utilization, transfer or
conveyance of the same for purposes inimical to national security, or when
necessary to protect the interest of the Government or any of its instrumentalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall include the taking over and
assumption of the management, control and operation of the private property or
assets seized’ (reiterated in P.D. No. 1835, the Anti-Subversion Law of 1981,
repealed by P.D. No. 1975 prom. on May 2, 1985) (see Phil. Law Dictionary,
Moreno, 1982 ed., pp. 568-569).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
this, too, is the sense in which the term is commonly understood in other
jurisdictions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>d. No Divestment of Title Over Property Seized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It may perhaps be well at this point to stress once again the
provisional, contingent character of the remedies just described.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the law plainly qualifies the remedy
of takeover by the adjective, ‘provisional.’ These remedies may be resorted to
only for a particular exigency:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to
prevent in the public interest the disappearance or dissipation of property or
business, and conserve it pending <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span> in
appropriate proceedings of the primary issue of whether or not the acquisition
of title or other right thereto by the apparent owner was attended by some
vitiating anomaly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None of the remedies
is meant to deprive the owner or possessor of his title or any right to the
property sequestered, frozen or taken over and vest it in the sequestering
agency, the Government or other person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This can be done only for the causes and by the processes laid down by
law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That this is the sense in which the power to sequester, freeze or
provisionally take over is to be understood and exercised, the language of the
executive orders in question leaves no doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Executive Order No. 1 declares that the sequestration of property the
acquisition of which is suspect shall last ‘until the transactions leading to
such acquisition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> can
be disposed of by the appropriate authorities.’ (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>)
Executive order No. 2 declares that the assets or properties, therein mentioned
shall remain frozen ‘pending the outcome of appropriate proceedings in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to determine whether any such assets or properties were acquired’ by illegal
means.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Executive Order No. 14 makes
clear that judicial proceedings are essential for the resolution of the basic
issue of whether or not particular assets are ill-gotten, and resultant
recovery thereof by the Government is warranted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>f. Kinship to attachment, Receivership</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">As thus described, sequestration, freezing and
provisional takeover are akin to the provisional remedy of preliminary
attachment, or receivership.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">BASECO's</span> counsel agrees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 690) By attachment, a sheriff seizes
property of a defendant in a civil suit so that it may stand as security for
the satisfaction of any judgment that may be obtained, and not disposed of, or
dissipated, or lost intentionally or otherwise, pending the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Rule 57, Rules of Court) By receivership,
property, real or personal, which is subject of litigation, is placed in the
possession and control of a receiver appointed by the Court, who shall conserve
it pending final determination of the title or right of possession over it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Rule 59, Rules of Court) <u>All</u> <u>these</u>
<u>remedies</u> <u>-</u> <u>sequestration</u>, <u>freezing</u>, <u>provisional</u>,
<u>takeover</u>, <u>attachment</u> <u>and</u> <u>receivership</u> <u>-</u> <u>are</u>
<u>provisional</u>, <u>temporary</u>, <u>designed</u> <u>for</u> <u>particular</u>
<u>exigencies</u>, <u>attended</u> <u>by</u> <u>no</u> <u>character</u> <u>of</u>
<u>permanency</u> <u>or</u> <u>finality</u>, <u>and</u> <u>always</u> <u>subject</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>control</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>issuing</u> <u>court</u>
<u>or</u> <u>agency</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10. PCGG not a 'Judge', General Functions</blockquote>

<blockquote>It should also by now be reasonably evident from what has thus far
been said that the PCGG is not, and was never intended to act as, a judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its general function is to conduct
investigations in order to collect evidence establishing instances of
'ill-gotten wealth;' issue sequestration, and such orders as may be warranted
by the evidence thus collected and as may be necessary to preserve and conserve
the assets of which it takes custody and control and prevent their
disappearance, loss or dissipation; and eventually file and prosecute in the
proper court of competent jurisdiction all cases investigated by it as may be
warranted by its findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not
try and decide, or hear and determine, or adjudicate with any character of
finality or compulsion, cases involving the essential issue of whether or not
property should be forfeited and transferred to the State because 'ill-gotten'
within the meaning of the Constitution and the executive orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This function is reserved to the designated
court, in this case, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ex. <span class="SpellE">Ord</span>. No. 14)
There can therefore be no serious regard accorded to the accusation, leveled by
BASECO, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 695-697) that the PCGG plays the
perfidious role of prosecutor and judge at the same time.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>b. PCGG Has Only Powers of Administration</blockquote>

<blockquote>The PCGG may thus exercise only powers of administration over the
property or business sequestered or provisionally taken over, much like a
court-appointed receiver, (See Sec. 7, Rule 59, Rules of Court) such as to
bring and defend actions in its own name; receive rents; collect debts due; pay
outstanding debts; and generally do such other acts and things as may be
necessary to fulfill its mission as conservator and administrator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this context, it may in addition enjoin or
restrain any actual or threatened commission of acts by any person or entity
that may render moot and academic, or frustrate or otherwise make ineffectual
its efforts to carry out its task; punish for direct or indirect contempt in
accordance with the Rules of Court; and seek and secure the assistance of any
office, agency or instrumentality of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 3, d, f, g, Ex. <span class="SpellE">Ord</span>.
No. 1) In the case of sequestered businesses generally (i.e., going concerns,
businesses in current operation), as in the case of sequestered objects, its
essential role, as already discussed, is that of conservator, caretaker,
'watchdog' or overseer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not that
of manager, or innovator, much less an owner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> power to sequester
alleged ill-gotten properties is likened to the provisional remedies of
preliminary attachment or receivership which are always subject to the control
of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That this power of the
PCGG is provisional in nature has been emphasized in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Baseco</u></span>
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We rule that the extent of such
power should be related to the role of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in sequestration cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Peña</u></span> case, we defined the role of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> with regard to the sequestered properties by
stating that "Under section 2 of the President's Executive Order No. 14
issued on May 7, 1986, all cases of the Commission regarding the ‘Funds,
Moneys, Assets, and Properties Illegally Acquired or Misappropriated by Former
President Ferdinand Marcos, their close Relatives, Subordinates, Business
Associates, Dummies, Agents or Nominees’ whether civil or criminal are lodged
within the ‘exclusive and original jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>’
and all incidents arising from, incident to, or related to, such cases
necessarily fall likewise under the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
exclusive and original jurisdiction, subject to the review on <i>certiorari</i>
exclusively by the Supreme Court." (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp.
561-562) Also in the consolidated cases of <u>Andres</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Soriano</u></span>
<u>III</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Yuzon</u></span>,
<u>et</u> <u>al</u>., G.R. No. 74910; <u>Eduardo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Cojuangco</u></span>,
<u>Jr</u>., <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <u>v</u>. <u>Securities</u> <u>and</u> <u>Exchange</u>
<u>Commission</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>., G.R. No. 75075; <span class="SpellE"><u>Ganay</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <u>Presidential</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>on</u> <u>Good</u> <u>Government</u>,
G.R. No. 75094, 164 SCRA 226 [1988], we ruled "that exclusive jurisdiction
conferred in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> would evidently extend
not only to the principal causes of action, i.e. the recovery of alleged
ill-gotten wealth, but also to all incidents arising from, incidental or
related to, such cases such as disputes over the sale of the shares, the
propriety of the issuance of ancillary writs of provisional remedies relative
thereto, the sequestration thereof which may be made the subject of separate
actions or proceedings in another forum." (Resolution, August 10, 1988)
The questioned order is an exercise of the jurisdiction which this Court has
outlined in the principal cases governing the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
powers, as possessed by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner charges the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> with committing grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention has no
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We see no abuse of discretion in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
placing the dividends under litigation in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span>

the name and under the full control of one of the litigants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Placing property in
litigation under judicial possession, whether in the hands of a receiver, an

from which it appears that it is, or will become, necessary to a complete
determination of the controversy involved, or to the enforcement of the

refers to the discretionary nature of the exercise of administrative functions

administrative agencies for reasons reiterated therein, to wit:</p>

involving the exercise of judgment or discretion, and findings of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There should be no thought of disregarding
the traditional line separating judicial and administrative competence, the
former being entrusted with the determination of legal questions and the latter
being limited as a result of its expertise to the ascertainment of the decisive
facts.’ This is specially true in sequestration cases affected by the
Commission for the recovery of the nation's plundered wealth that may affect
the nation's very survival, in the light of the constitutional mandate that
such sequestration or freeze orders ‘shall be issued only upon showing a <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> <u>case</u>’ (Art. XVIII sec. 26, Constitution) and the settled
principle that findings by administrative or quasi-judicial agencies like the
Commission are entitled to the greatest respect and are practically binding and
conclusive, like the factual/findings of the trial and appellate courts, save
where they are patently arbitrary or capricious or are not supported by
substantial evidence." <span class="GramE">(Presidential Commission on Good

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the administration of the sequestered properties is left
to the PCGG but it must be borne in mind that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>

properties by issuing orders and ancillary writs including placing the

so as to make its judgment effective as well as to protect the rightful
claimants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This authority is judicial
and not an administrative matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">If a trial court is convinced that the preservation of properties
under litigation calls for placing them in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>, it has the power to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We will not reverse the exercise of this
