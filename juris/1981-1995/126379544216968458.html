<span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> 
were charged with the crime of Murder before the then Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [1]</sup> 
After trial, with the exception of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> who 
was at large up to the time of the <span>trial, </span>all the accused were 
found guilty as charged and each of them sentenced to suffer the penalty of 
<em>reclusion perpetua</em> with the accessory penalties provided for by law and 
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased jointly and severally a) the sum of 
P12,000.00 for the death of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, b) P12,000.00 as actual damages, c) P5,000.00 as 
moral damages and d) costs of suit.</p>
<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Between 4:00 and 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October 12, 1980, 
<span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> and Charlie 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> were walking in that order along <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Sta. 
Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, 
having come from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> (pp. 6-8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Jan. 7, 1981).<span>&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, several 
persons, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> 
approached them from behind (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Jan. 
7, 1981; pp. 7-9, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Jan. 30, 1981).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> then twisted both 
arms of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> 
around the latter's neck (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Jan. 7, 
1981).<span>&nbsp; </span>As the latter was thus rendered helpless and unable to 
defend <span class="GramE">himself</span>, he was hit on the head by <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> with a hollow block 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B") knocking him down (pp. 9-10, 
<em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> was lying prostrate on the ground, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> stabbed him several times on the stomach and breast 
<span>with a </span>fan knife.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who was armed with a stainless weapon similar to a 
<span class="GramE">knife,</span> likewise stabbed <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> in the stomach (pp. 11, 15-16, <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>While Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> were stabbing <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE"><span>Paras</span></span><span> </span>hit <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> with a hollow 
block on the head and afterwards kicked him (p. 22, <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> likewise hit <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE"><span>Cayanan</span></span><span> on </span>the head also with a 
hollow block (pp. 19-20, <em>id.</em>).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> shouted for help as she tried to parry the stab 
blows of Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> upon <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> but Alejandro 
<span class="SpellE">Paras</span> pushed her aside (pp. 27-29, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Jan. 17, 11981).<span>&nbsp; </span>As a result, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> sustained 
wounds on her hands which were treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span> at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename>

1981</st1:date>).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Appellants fled after <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> told them "come on, let us go, anyway he is already 
dead" (pp. 10-12, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date month="1" day="9" year="1981">Jan. 9, 1981</st1:date>).<span>&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> called on 
her neighbors and requested assistance in <span class="GramE">placing</span> <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> on board a 
tricycle and in bringing him to the hospital for treatment (pp. 12-13, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, Charlie 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, who also witnessed the incident, ran 
towards the <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> police station (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1981">Jan. 30, 
1981</st1:date>).<span>&nbsp; </span>On the way, he met two policemen and reported to 
them the incident (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1981">Jan. 30, 1981</st1:date>).</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Police investigator Daniel <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> who was 
assigned to investigate the incident proceeded to the 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> at <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Dec. 29, 1981).<span>&nbsp; </span>A few minutes later, 
the body of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> 
arrived at said hospital and was pronounced dead on arrival by the Director 
thereof, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Yuchengco</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the said 
hospital, Police Investigator Daniel <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> saw <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> (pp. 
10-11, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon being 
informed by Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> that the <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> brothers were two of the assailants, said police 
investigator invited and brought them to the police station for investigation 
(pp. 11-12, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Upon their arrival at the police station of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, police 
investigator Daniel <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> saw the other suspects who 
had already been arrested (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Dec. 29, 
1981).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"A confrontation was had between eyewitness Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> and the suspects who were present at the police 
station namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Alberto 
<span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and 
Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> (pp. 18, 19, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, accompanied by 
Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Police Investigator Daniel <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> proceeded to the scene of the incident at <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Street, Sta. Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> where he picked 
up a piece of hollow block pointed to by Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> as one of the hollow blocks used by the suspects 
in hitting <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> 
(p. 24, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).<span>&nbsp; </span>He also 
caused pictures to be taken at the scene of the incident (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"F") showing the alley (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"F"-1), the spot (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"F-2") where the hollow block 
and bloodstains were found (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"F-3").</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"After taking the sworn statements of <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> and Charlie 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, police investigator <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span> filed a criminal complaint (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G") against Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, and Francisco 
<span class="SpellE">Viray</span> with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </blockquote>
<blockquote>"Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> who performed 
the autopsy on the body of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> testified that he found six (6) stab wounds on the 
abdominal portion of the body and lacerated wounds on the head, forehead and 
nasal bone fracture (pp. 25-27, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. Dec. 17, 1980); 
that after opening the head of the deceased, he found hemorrhage of the cerebral 
vessel of the posterior pole (p. 26, <em>id.</em>); that the cause of bleeding 
was due to the blow or smash on the head, right eye-brow and nose (pp. 25-26, 
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>); that with respect to the 
abdominal wounds, he also opened the abdominal cavity and traced the direction 
of the wounds; that one of the wounds ended at mesentery or the fold of the 
<span class="SpellE">peritorium</span> which covered the abdominal organ; that one 
of the stab wounds penetrated the heart (pp. 27-30, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>); that the six (6) stab wounds on the 
stomach, and which were of the same depth were all fatal <span>(p. </span>28, 
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>); <span>that </span>the wounds on 
the chest and stomach were caused by different instruments as shown by the 
nature of the wounds (pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <em>id.</em>); 
that, thereafter, he issued a Certificate of Death attributing the victim's 
death to shock (cardiac <span class="SpellE">temporade</span>) due to hemorrhage 
caused by multiple stab and lacerated wounds (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 
"A")."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, evidence for the defense shows that all the 
accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>, Gregorio, Alberto, Juan, Alejandro 
all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> attended on <st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1980">October 12, 1980</st1:date> the funeral rites at <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> of their 
relative, <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the interment, accused Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> went home to <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, about 3 kilometers away or 2 hours ride in a motor 
<span class="SpellE">banca</span> from Sta. Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pampanga</span></span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rest of the accused 
returned to the house of their deceased relative at about <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time> of the same day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Accused Alberto and 
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> helped in the chores at the house of 
their late uncle while the other two accused Alejandro and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> left to attend to 
their respective personal necessities.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, upon his return at 
about 4:00 o'clock in the <span>afternoon, met on his way the deceased <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> in the company of 
his aunt, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, and Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> 
at <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Street, Sta. Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon seeing him, deceased <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> confronted him thus — "What is it that 
</span><span>you're </span><span>looking at", to which query, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> ans</span>wered in a 
loud voice, "Vulva of your Mother, What is it that you like?" Then <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> retorted back by 
saying, "Vulva of your Mother, are you going to fight?" <span class="GramE">(TSN, 
Sept. 2, 1981, pp. 10-11).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>To this challenge, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> answered "No", but 
all of a sudden <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> pulled out his fan knife, and rushing, stabbed 
accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> twice, 
hitting him in his left hand, and on his left knee cap.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, Sept. 2, 1981, p. 13).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> tried to 
pacify <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> in 
further attacking accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> by putting her arms around the body of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
the meanwhile, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> spotted a hollow block nearby, picked it up and threw 
it towards <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> 
while he was<span> being pacified hitting him on his face which caused the 
latter to fall to the ground.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sei</span><span>z</span><span>ing 
the opportunity, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> jumped at the fallen <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> so as to wrest 
from him his fan knife, and in the scuffle accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> injured his 
hands.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, September 2, 1981, pp. 
16-17).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Successful in taking away the knife of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> retreated, but <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> took hold of a 
stone and immediately hit accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> on his head making him groggy, and while <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> was again about 
to hit him with the same stone, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> to </span>repel the aggression, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> at his navel, and 
above his nipple.<span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> fell to the ground because of the said wounds, 
accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> left 
the scene of the incident and proceeded towards the direction of his late 
uncle's house.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, because of the injury he sustained in his 
knee, accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
was immobilized and was forced to crawl on his feet after walking some distance 
away from the place of the incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was at this juncture that 
the other accused Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> saw and lifted 
him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Before they could reach the house of their late uncle <span class="SpellE">Flaviano</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>, however, another 
brother, accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, after calling 
still<span> another brother, accused Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
(who was at the </span>river near the house with his two cousins cleaning and 
washing the tables, chairs and benches used in the wake), met and assisted 
accused Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> in carrying their brother 
accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moments later, accused Alberto <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who was then 
summoned by accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> arrived and he 
substituted accused Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> in carrying 
accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> to the 
<span class="SpellE"><em>banca</em></span> to be brought to the hospital.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Meanwhile, the other accused Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
left and proceeded inside the house of their <span>late uncle to change his 
clothes which were sputtered with blood when he lifted his wounded brother <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, September 21, 1981, pp. 37-38).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> interposed self-defense in admitting the wounding of 
the victim <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rest of the accused, 
namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Alejandro, Gregorio, Alberto and Juan all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, all put up <span class="GramE">alibi</span> as 
defense.<span>&nbsp; </span>On these points the trial court ruled 
—<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Under the facts and circumstances of the case as related by the 
accused and guided by the well rooted principles on the subject of self-defense, 
as adverted to above, and considering that, prior to the incident at bar, there 
had been bad blood between the <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> family on one 
hand, and <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, 
and the <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> family, upon the other, it is 
apparent that there was a tacit concert of design between <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and the deceased 
<span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> to settle 
their differences by force as may be gathered from the fact that when the 
deceased asked <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
what the latter was looking at him for, the former, or <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> answered whatever 
<span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> liked to 
happen even to the extent of make something out of it which, in effect, was a 
defiance and a challenge to fight in which case it is immaterial who began the 
aggression, it being a mere incident of the struggle which cannot be the basis 
of self-defense as claimed by the accused.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, when 
the accused agreed to fight <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, aggression is <span class="GramE">a mere incident 
because the accused voluntarily exposed himself to the consequences of a fight 
with his opponent and because the intention of the contending parties can not be 
other than to mutually injure</span> each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>The first attack 
which may come from either is but an incident of the same fight and it cannot in 
any manner be considered an unlawful aggression or unexpected aggression.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is already a well-settled rule, firmly established in many decisions 
interpretative of Article II of the Revised Penal Code that, after the accused 
accepts a challenge, thereby placing himself in an unlawful status and one of 
force, the prior aggression of his opponent, which as it was not unexpected, 
could not catch him off his guard, excludes the condition of lawful defense, for 
the challenge by itself excludes the classification of self-defense that, 
totally or partially exempts from liability (<em>U.S. vs. Cortez</em>, 36 Phil. 
337).<span>&nbsp; </span>There being no unlawful aggression, there can be no self- 
defense, either complete or incomplete.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"The second element of self-defense — </span>reasonable 
necessity of the means employed to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression — 
has not been proved.<span>&nbsp; </span>The intimation of the accused that after the 
deceased fell down when hit by a hollow block he threw at him, <span>the 
deceased picked up a hollow block and tried to throw it at him, and it was at 
that instance that he (<span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>) stabbed the deceased 
twice at the stomach and below the left nipple.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is unbelievable 
and strange that, after falling on the ground when hit with hollow block at the 
head thrown by the accused, that the deceased was still able to pick up a hollow 
block and tried to hit with it against the accused.<span>&nbsp; </span>But even 
conceding, without admitting, that the deceased was able to pick up a hollow 
block, it is still clear that when the deceased fell on the ground when 
</span><span>hit </span><span>with hollow block thrown at him by the accused, it 
was no longer necessary to stab twice the deceased as the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> life was in no real and imminent danger from the 
deceased who was already so weak and had no more sufficient strength to confront 
and assault the accused, as the latter presented the court to believe.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The theory of self-defense is based on the necessity on the part of the 
accused to prevent or repel the unlawful aggression, and when the danger or risk 
on his part has disappeared the stabbing should have stopped.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considering that the deceased was stabbed after the latter was prostrate 
on the ground to the extent of killing him without the necessity of doing it for 
self-defense, the accused is responsible for the death of the 
deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"And, if it is true that accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> held the knife of 
the deceased in self-defense, it is strange that he lost the knife </span>in his 
flight with the evident intention of hiding vital evidence involved in the 
incident."</blockquote>

same must be established by clear and positive evidence, free </span>from doubt 
and bias and that purely oral evidence presented to prove it cannot prevail over 
positive evidence showing the presence of the accused at the scene of the crime 
and his participation in the commission thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the instant 
case the identification of accused Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and 
Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who hit <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> at the head with hollow block in the afternoon 
of October 12, 1980 at <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Street, Sta. Lucia, 
<span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, had been 
established by worthy and credible witnesses.<span>&nbsp; </span>As announced by the 
Supreme Court in a long line of unbroken decisions (<em>People vs. Mansueto</em> 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Jamero</em></span><em>, et al.</em>, G.R. L-19852, July 
29, 1968, 24 SCRA 206 and related cases) for alibi to prosper, it is not enough 
to prove that the accused was somewhere else when the crime was committed, but 
must, likewise, demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have 
been at the scene of the commission of the crime complained of.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considering that there is no evidence of record that it was physically 
impossible for accused Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, - who was only about few meters, in the case of 
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, and more than three kilometers, in the 
case of Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, away <span>from the scene of the 
crime to be at the scene of the commission of the crime at <span class="SpellE">Ilang-Ilang</span> Street, Sta. Lucia, <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, — the alibi of 
both accused did not meet this standard.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"The information alleges conspiracy and </span>the qualifying 
circumstance of treachery, taking advantage of superior strength and with 
evident premeditation.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"Upon the evidence as a whole proven by the prosecution, the 
circumstance of treachery appears to be sufficiently proven.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
suddenness of the attack as shown by the fact that the arms of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> were twisted by 
accused Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> around the neck of 
the victim which left the victim no opportunity whatsoever to defend himself 
when accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
hit the victim with a hollow block at the head, causing the latter to fall down 
slowly and, once the victim was on the ground, <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and 
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> stabbed <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> several times at 
the stomach and breast with bladed weapons, and at the same time Juan <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> and Francisco 
<span class="SpellE">Viray</span> hit <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> with hollow block which landed at the head of the 
victim, all these show treachery.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The qualifying circumstance of superior strength cannot be taken 
into account in this case for the reason that the circumstance of taking 
advantage of superior strength is inherent in, and comprehended by the 
circumstance of treachery.<span>&nbsp; </span>When treachery is taken into account as 
a qualifying circumstance in murder, it is improper again to consider, in 
addition to that circumstance, the generic aggravating circumstance of abuse of 
superior strength since the latter is necessarily included in the 
former.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation has not been 
proven and cannot be considered in this case.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in 
the record to suggest the idea that the accused had conceived of the thought to 
kill the deceased and had sufficient time thereafter to reflect upon the 
consequences of their act as to allow their conscience to overcome the 
resolution of their will if they desire to <span class="SpellE">harken</span> to 
their warnings.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Conspiracy alleged in the Information has been proven.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This means that the acts of the conspirators are the acts of all.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>For conspiracy to exist it is not necessary that two or more persons met 
together and entered into an explicit or formal agreement for an unlawful 
scheme; or that they directly, verbally or in writing, stated what the unlawful 
scheme was to be, and of the plans or means by which the unlawful combination 
was to be made effective.<span>&nbsp; </span>It can be inferred and proven by the 
acts of the accused themselves when said acts point to a joint purpose and 
design, concerted action, and united <span>in its execution.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, 
when the accused by their acts aimed at the same object, one performing one part 
and another performing another part so as to complete it, with a view to the 
attainment of the same object, and their acts, though apparently independent 
were in fact concerted and cooperative indicating closeness </span><span>of 
</span><span>personal association, concerted action and concurrence of 
sentiments, as in the instant case, — the court is justified in concluding that 
all the accused were engaged in a conspiracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>It appearing that 
all the accused took part in inflicting injuries to the deceased which all prove 
to be fatal, all the accused are guilty of murder as principal by direct 
participation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Proceeding from the fact that the six (6) stab 
wounds and head injuries inflicted upon the victim, were all mortal and fatal, — 
according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Suñga</span>, Municipal Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, who performed 
the autopsy upon the body of <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span>, — the question as to who among the accused 
inflicted which wounds and how many, is of no legal relevance since each is 
responsible for the acts of the other as his co-principals and 
co-conspirators.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error committed by the trial court.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Appellants assail the trial court in giving weight to the testimonies of 
witnesses <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> and her son Charlie on the ground that being the 
victim's relatives their testimonies are biased and devoid of merit.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Such contentions hold no water.</p>
<p class="BODY">The testimonies of said witnesses are clear and persuasive and 
corroborative of each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>The presence of these eyewitnesses 
was acknowledged by accused <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>The stabbing incident happened 
in broad daylight making the identification of the appellants easy and 
certain.<span>&nbsp; </span>That they were relatives of the victim <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> does not perforce 
impair their credibility on their positive identification of the assailants and 
how the crime took place.<span>&nbsp; </span>These witnesses actually saw the 
appellants stab and also hit the victim on the head with a hollow block.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The corroborative testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> who made an autopsy on the victim is to the 
effect that all the stab wounds were fatal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Failure on the part of 
the witnesses to point specifically the parts of the body which were hit was due 
to the <span>series of sudden acts of stabbing and in no way affects their 
credibility.<span>&nbsp; </span>Appellants argue that the testimony </span>of <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> that she 
tried to pacify appellant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> after the 
latter had stabbed <span class="SpellE">Roseller</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayanan</span> is allegedly contrary to her later testimony that 
she attempted to pacify appellant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> 
before the latter hit the victim on the chest.<span>&nbsp; </span>We fail to see the 
inconsistency in this.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is possible that this witness tried to 
pacify appellant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> after the latter had 
hit the victim on the stomach but before hit<span>ting again on the 
chest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The testimony of witness Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, who was only 11 years old at the time he 
testified in court, that it was his mother who brought the victim to the 
hospital is not inconsistent with his mother's testimony that the neighbors who 
responded to <span class="SpellE">Consolacion's</span> shout for help were the 
ones who took him to the hospital since these neighbors not only helped in 
placing the victim on board a tricycle but also in bringing the victim to the 
hospital along with <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>The fact that the prosecution presented 
only one hollow block (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span></span><span> "B") 
does not negate the fact that the appellants were each holding a hollow block to 
hit the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "B" was presented to show that indeed 
there were such hollow blocks at the scene of the incident used in killing the 
victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Witness Charlie <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> then 
only a young boy remained resolute on the material points of his testimony that 
after appellant Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> had stabbed the 
victim, it was appellant <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> who hit the victim on the head with a hollow 
block.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Appellants deny conspiracy as found by the trial 
court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Their denial of conspiracy is belied by the 
following:<span>&nbsp; </span>appellants are members of one family; the attack was 
done by them suddenly and simultaneously; all the appellants took part in 
inflicting injuries on the deceased which all proved to be fatal; after the 
attack and seeing the victim lying prostrate on the ground dying, they left the 
scene of the crime at the same time in response to the command of <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> to leave the victim 
as he was already dead anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In rejecting treachery, appellants maintain that the killing 
of the deceased was frontal and therefore he was not deprived of the opportunity 
to defend himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such contention is untenable.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
records reveal that before the victim was stabbed and hit several times with 
hollow blocks on the head, his arms were twisted, rendering him helpless to 
defend himself or repel the initial assault.<span>&nbsp; </span>This mode of attack 
was deliberately and consciously resorted to by the appellants to insure the 
commission of the crime without </span><span>risk </span><span>to the latter 
arising from the defense that the victim might put up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As to self-defense and alibi interposed by the appellants 
the ruling laid down by the trial court as aforementioned is well-taken as it is 
fully substantiated by the records of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
