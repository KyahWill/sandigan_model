VS. HONORATO JUDICO AND NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before Us is a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> to review the
decision of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC, for brevity) dated
September 9, 1985 reversing the decision of Labor Arbiter Vito J. <span class="SpellE">Minoria</span>, dated June 9, 1983, by 1) ordering petitioner
insurance company, Great Pacific Life Assurance Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>, for brevity) to recognize private respondent <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span> <span class="SpellE">Judico</span>, as its regular
employee as defined under Art. 281 of the Labor Code and 2) remanding the case
to its origin for the determination of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Judico's</span>
money claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case show that <span class="SpellE">Honorato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Judico</span> filed a complaint for illegal dismissal
against <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>duly organized insurance firm,
before the NLRC Regional Arbitration Branch No. VII, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said complaint prayed for award of money
claims consisting of separation pay, unpaid salary and 13th month pay, refund
of cash bond, moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the NLRC when a decision was rendered by
the Labor Arbiter dismissing the complaint on the ground that the
employer-employee relations did not exist between the parties but ordered <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> to pay complainant the sum of P1,000.00 by reason
of Christian Charity.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, said decision was reversed by the NLRC ruling that complainant
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>a regular employee as defined
under Art. 281 of the Labor Code and declaring the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> questioning the legality of the payment of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>complainant
moot and academic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, for the
purpose of revoking the <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond of said
company it ruled that the Labor Arbiter erred in awarding P1,000.00 to
complainant in the absence of any legal or factual basis to support its
payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="GramE">company</span> moved to reconsider,
which was denied, hence this petition for review raising four legal issues to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether the relationship between insurance
agents and their principal, the insurance company, is that of agent and
principal to be governed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the
Insurance Code and the Civil Code provisions on agency, or one of employer-employee,
to be governed by the Labor Code.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>II<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether</span> insurance agents are entitled
to the employee benefits prescribed by the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>III. Whether the
public respondent NLRC has jurisdiction to take cognizance of a controversy
between insurance agent and the insurance company, arising from their agency
relations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IV. Whether the
public respondent acted correctly in setting aside the decision of Labor
Arbiter Vito J. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Minoria</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and in ordering the case remanded to <span class="GramE">said</span> Labor Arbiter for further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 159, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The crux of these issues boil down to the
question of whether or not employer-employee relationship existed between
petitioner and private respondent.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admits that on <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="6">June
 9, 1976</st1:date>, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Judico</span>
entered into an agreement of agency with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
to become a debit agent attached to the industrial life agency in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner defines <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>debit agent as "an insurance
agent selling/servicing industrial life plans and policy holders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Industrial life plans are those whose
premiums are payable either daily, weekly or monthly and which are collectible
by the debit agents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span>the home
or any place designated by the policy holder" (p. 156, <span class="SpellE">Roll<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">o</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Such admission is in
line with the findings of public respondent that as such debit agent, private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Judico</span> had definite work assignments
including but not limited to collection of premiums <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">from policy holders and selling insurance to prospective clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public respondent NLRC also found out that
complainant </span>was initially paid P200.00 as allowance for thirteen (13)
weeks regardless of production and later a certain percentage denominated as
sales reserve of his total collections but not lesser than P200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in September 1981, complainant was
promoted to the position of Zone Supervisor and was given additional
(supervisor's) allowance fixed at P110.00 per week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the third week of November 1981, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">he was </span>reverted to his former position
as debit agent but, for unknown reasons, not paid so-called weekly sales
reserve of at least P200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1982</st1:date>, complainant was
dismissed by way of termination of his agency contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the findings of the NLRC that private
respondent is an employee of the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner argues that <span class="SpellE">Judico's</span> compensation
was not based on any fixed number of hours he was required to devote to the
service of petitioner company but rather it was the production or result of his
efforts or his work that was being compensated and that the so-called allowance
for the first thirteen weeks that <span class="SpellE">Judico</span> worked as
debit agent, cannot be construed as salary but as a subsidy or a way of
assistance for transportation and meal expenses of a new debit agent during the
initial period of his training which was fixed for thirteen (13) weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise, petitioner contends that <span class="SpellE">Judico's</span> compensation, in the form of commissions and
bonuses, was based on actual production, (insurance plans sold and premium
collections).</p>

<p class="BODY">Said contentions of petitioner are strongly rejected by private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He maintains that he
received a definite amount as his wage known as "sales reserve" the
failure to maintain the same would bring him back to a beginner's employment
with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>fixed
weekly wage of P200.00 regardless of production.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned a definite place in the
office to work on when he is not in the field; and in addition to canvassing
and making regular reports, he was burdened with the job of collection and to make
regular weekly report thereto for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which
an anemic performance would mean a dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He earned out of his faithful and productive service, a promotion to
Zone </span>Supervisor with additional supervisor's allowance, (a definite or
fixed amount of P110.00) that he was dismissed primarily because of anemic
performance and not because of the termination of the contract of agency
substantiate the fact that he was indeed an employee of the petitioner and not
an insurance agent in the ordinary meaning of the term.</p>

<p class="BODY">That private respondent <span class="SpellE">Judico</span> was an agent
of the petitioner is unquestionable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>We have held in Investment Planning Corp, vs. SSS, 21 SCRA 294, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">an </span>insurance
company may have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">two classes of agents
who sell its insurance policies:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
salaried employees who keep definite hours and work under the control and
supervision of the company; and (2) registered representatives who work on
commission basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agents who belong
to the second category are not required to report for work at anytime, they do
not have to devote their time exclusively to or work solely for the company
since the time and the effort they spend in their work depend entirely upon
their own will and initiative; they are not required to account for their time
nor </span>submit a report <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>their
activities; they shoulder their own selling expenses as well as <span class="SpellE">trasportation</span>; and they are paid their commission based on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>certain
percentage of their sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One salient
point in the determination of employer-employee relationship which cannot be e<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a</span>sily ignored is the fact that the compensation
that these agents on commission received is not paid by the insurance company
but by the investor (or the person insured).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After determining the commission earned by an agent on his sales the
agent directly deducts it from the amount he received from the investor or the
person insured and turns over to the insurance company the amount invested
after such deduction is made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The test
therefore is whether the "employer" controls or has reserved the
right to control the "employee" not only as to the result of the work
to be done but also as to the means and methods by which the same is to be
accomplished.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the aforementioned test to the case at bar, We can
readily see that the element of control by the petitioner on <span class="SpellE">Judico</span> was very much present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Judico</span> received a definite minimum amount per week <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>his wage
known as "sales reserve" wherein the failure to maintain the same
would bring him back to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>beginner's employment with a fixed weekly wage of P200.00 for thirteen
weeks regardless of production.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
assigned a definite place in the office to work on when he is not in the field;
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>addition
to his canvassing work he was burdened with the job of collection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In both cases he was required to make regular
report to the company regarding <span class="GramE">this duties</span>, and for
which an anemic performance would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">mean
a dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely faithful and
productive service earned him a promotion to Zone Supervisor with additional
supervisor's allowance, a definite amount of P110.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">aside </span>from the regular P200.00 weekly "allowance".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, his contract of services with
petitioner is <span class="GramE">not for a piece of work nor</span> for a
definite period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, an
ordinary commission insurance agent works at his own volition or at his own
leisure without fear of dismissal from the company and short of committing acts
detrimental to the business interest of the company <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">or </span>against the latter, whether he produces or not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>of no moment as his salary is based
on <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his </span>production, his anemic
performance or even dead result does not become a ground for dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whereas, in private respondent's case, the
undisputed facts show that he was controlled by petitioner insurance company
not only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to the kind of work;
the amount of results, the kind of performance but also the power of
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, private
respondent, by nature of his position and work, had been a regular employee of
petitioner and is therefore entitled to the protection of the law and could not
just be terminated without valid and justifiable cause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
