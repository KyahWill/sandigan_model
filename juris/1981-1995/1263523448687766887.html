This case commenced on December 27, 1971 in the Municipal Court of 
Lopez, Quezon where a criminal complaint was filed against herein 
private respondent Edgardo Caballas for Serious Physical Injuries 
allegedly committed as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "That on or about the 21st day of December, 1971, at about 7:00 
o'clock in the evening at Magsaysay District, municipality of Lopez, 
Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this 
Honorable Court, the abovenamed accused, with deliberate intent, did 
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and 
stab one Ernesto Sandoval with unidentified knife, thus causing upon the
 latter physical injuries to wit:  1. Wound, stabbed, 1 cm. long, 
penetrating and perforating abdominal cavity, 1 cm. to right side of the
 Xyphoid process, non-involvement of the internal organs; 2. Wound, 
stabbed, 3 cm. long, penetrating and perforating posterior abdominal 
wall, cutting the terminal portion of the 10th rib, along the posterior 
axillary line, left which physical injuries will require medical 
treatment for a period of more than thirty (30) days and will 
incapacitate the said Ernesto Sandoval from the performance of his 
customary labors for the same period of time."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Upon arraignment on February 5, 1972, the accused Caballas pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  Before the presentation of evidence, the private prosecutor on 
February 23, 1972 filed an "Urgent Motion to Amend the Complaint" to 
charge the offense of Frustrated Murder, contending that a perusal of 
the affidavits of the witnesses for the prosecution patently shows that 
in the commission of the act complained of, the accused had the manifest
 intention to kill the offended party.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  The defense, on the other hand, in its Memorandum argued that since 
the accused had already entered his plea, the Court could no longer 
entertain the Motion for amendment of the complaint, the intended 
amendment being a substantial one for a grave offense with a higher 
penalty, citing Section 13, Rule 110 of the Revised Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The Motion was denied in an Order of the Municipal Court dated April 6, 1972 stating that:
  </p><blockquote>
    <p> "Of course the law just pointed out, the facts of this case as 
well as the ground raised by the prosecution (that of not having charged
 in the complaint the proper offense) do not absolutely rule out the 
legal propriety of allowing amendment of the complaint so as to charge 
the proper offense.  Reason, however, exists for a denial of the motion.
  In the first place all that is before the Court for its appreciation 
at this stage of the proceedings is the same evidence disclosed during 
the preliminary examination of this case and during that examination the
 investigating officer had before him a complaint for Serious Physical 
Injuries and was limited in his task to determining whether or not the 
evidence presented supports a reasonable ground to believe that the 
offense charged has been committed as alleged in the complaint. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
"In the absence of a clear showing that there is no merit in the charge 
being investigated because the filing of the complaint for a graver 
offense is warranted by the evidence or unless what was found by the 
investigating officer to have been committed is manifestly different 
from the offense charged there would be no lawful sanction to the 
investigating officer's making a declaration that the complaint be 
amended to charge what may be the proper offense."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
The case, thereafter, proceeded to trial.  Both parties rested their evidence and the case was submitted for decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  No decision on the merits was rendered, however, for in an Order dated
 November 29, 1972, the Municipal Court ruled as follows:
</p><p>
"While considering the evidence of this case the court realized that the
 evidence on the injuries sustained by the accused and the circumstances
 surrounding the infliction thereof overwhelmingly point to the 
conclusion that the intention of the assailant was to inflict more than 
just injuries.  Hence, the court is restricted by what it considers a 
legal obstacle to the validity of whatever judgment it renders, because 
whether it be one of acquittal or conviction - it shall have so ordered 
on a case outside its jurisdiction.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The evidence is positive and uncontradicted that the person who 
inflicted the stab wounds on Ernesto Sandoval had evidently not by 
accident but by design, walked with the victim from a certain point on 
Real Street up to some 400 meters therefrom which is another spot on a 
quite unfrequented side street; that it was in that spot where the 
victim was stabbed four times, two of which hit the victim - one, on the
 abdominal region and another 'penetrating and perforating the posterior
 abdominal wall, cutting the terminal portion of the 10th rib'; that 
this was at about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of December 1971, at which
 time it must have been dark already; that the victim was alone, and 
that the attack was sudden and treacherous. </p>
  <p> "It has also been shown that the knife used by the assailant 
measures about 6 inches in length; that the victim was not able to walk 
by himself after having been stabbed but that he had to be carried to 
the hospital and that while there, the victim almost lost consciousness.
  By the medical certificate issued by a physician of the hospital 
(Magsaysay Memorial Hospital, Lopez, Quezon) the duration of treatment 
has been placed at 30 days. </p>
  <p> "The Court believes that the foregoing evidence would support <em>prima facie</em>
 a complaint for the crime of frustrated murder and, as stated, prevents
 it from rendering judgment in this case.  It cannot even rule that the 
parties have waived the question of jurisdiction having proceeded with 
the trial of the case up to its termination as this would be legally 
erroneous. </p>
  <p> "The proceedings in the case, however, may not be considered to 
have been rendered useless because by it more than by a mere preliminary
 investigation, the court has arrived at a better supported finding that
 the proper complaint should have been for frustrated murder; that the 
crime of frustrated murder has been committed and that there is reason 
to believe that the accused Edgardo Caballas might have been the one who
 had committed the same. </p>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, this case is hereby dismissed to 
give way to the filing of a complaint for frustrated murder.  Since the 
proceedings from the preliminary examination up to the conclusion of the
 trial hereof has amounted to a compliance with the requirements of a 
preliminary investigation first and second stage, let the records hereof
 be forwarded to the Court of First Instance at Calauaq, Quezon, under 
the jurisdiction of which court the case for frustrated murder pertains,
 through the office of the Provincial Fiscal so that the latter may act 
on this case and file the corresponding complaint as above recommended."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In compliance with the foregoing Order, the Pro­vincial Fiscal of Quezon
 on June 6, 1973 filed with the respondent Court, the Court of First 
Instance of Quezon, Branch IV, an Information for frustrated murder 
against the same accused Edgardo Caballas, which alleges:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 21st day of December, 1971, in the 
Municipality of Lopez, Province of Quezon, Philippines, and within the 
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, Edgardo 
Caballas, armed with a knife, with intent to kill and with evident 
premeditation and treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
 feloniously attack, assault and stab with the said knife one ERNESTO 
SANDOVAL, thereby inflicting upon the latter the following injuries, to 
wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> “1.  Wound, stabbed, 1 cm. long, penetrating and perforating 
abdominal cavity, 1 cm. to right side of the xyphoid process, 
non-involvement of the internal organs. </p>
    <p> “2.  Wound, stabbed, 3 cm. long, penetrating and perforating 
posterior abdominal wall, cutting the ter­minal portion of the 10th rib,
 along the posterior axillary line, left. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
thus performing all the acts of execution which should have produced the
 crime of mur­der as a consequence, but which nevertheless did not 
produce it by reason of causes independent of his will, that is, by the 
timely and able medical attendance rendered to said Ernesto Sandoval 
which prevented his death."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
On October 22, 1973, the accused moved to quash the above-quoted 
Information on the ground of double jeopardy.  The Motion was granted by
 respondent Court ruling that the "Information for Frustrated Murder is 
essentially barred by the rules on double jeopardy as defined in Rule 
117, Section 9 of the Revised Rules of Court," for the reason that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x accused Edgardo Caballas had been placed in full jeopardy 
for the crime of Serious Physical Injuries under the Complaint marked as
 Exhibit '1' previously filed before the Municipal Court of Lopez, 
Quezon which was dismissed and otherwise terminated by the Presiding 
Judge of said Court after the accused had actually been arraigned and 
after the evidence by the prosecution and the defense have all been 
submitted to the Court and at a time when the parties have submitted the
 case for decision.  Such being the case a new prosecution of the 
accused Edgardo Caballas under the present information for Frustrated 
Murder which necessarily includes the crime of Serious Physical Injuries
 as held by the Supreme Court in a long line of decisions, would 
inevitably place the accused Edgardo Caballas in second jeopardy for an 
offense for which he had been previously jeopar­dized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing Order is now sought to be reviewed by the instant Petition
 filed by the Office of the Solicitor General.  The sole issue raised is
 whether or not the dismissal by the Municipal Court of Lopez, Quezon, 
of the complaint for serious physical injuries against the accused 
Edgardo Caballas is a dismissal which bars the filing of the information
 for frustrated murder in the Court of First Instance against the same 
accused on the ground of double jeopardy.
</p><p>
The principle, founded upon reason, justice and conscience, that <em>nemo debet bis puniri pro uno delicto</em> is embodied in the Philippine Constitution as one of the basic rights of the citizens.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  It is ordained in the Bill of Rights, Article IV, of the 1973 Constitution that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 22.  No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment 
for the same offense.  If an act is punished by a law and an ordinance, <em>conviction or acquittal</em> under either shall constitute a bar to another prosecution for the same act." (Italics supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The same provision is found in Article III, Section 1 (20) of the 
Constitution of 1935.  This constitutional mandate is restated in Rule 
117 of the Revised Rules of Court, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 9.  Former conviction or acquittal or former jeopardy.  - When a defendant shall have been <em>convicted or acquitted, or the  case against him dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the defendant</em>,
 by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a valid complaint or 
information or other formal charge sufficient in form and substance to 
sustain a conviction, and after the defendant had pleaded to the charge,
 the conviction or acquittal of the defendant or the dismissal of the 
case shall be a bar to another prosecution for the offense charged, or 
for any attempt to commit the same or frustration thereof, or for any 
offense which necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the 
offense charged in the former com­plaint or information." (Italics 
supplied.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Commenting on the double jeopardy protection embodied in the Rules of 
Court, Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, in his book "The Bill of 
Rights", makes the following significant commentary and We quote:  "It 
is to be noted that the Rules of Court in providing for a motion to 
quash, did extend further the reach of the double jeopardy protection.  
If the literal language of the constitutional provision were followed, 
either a previous acquittal or conviction is necessary before such a 
plea would lie.  As already noted, the Rules adopted an expansive view 
with the mention of the termination or dismissal of the prosecution 
without the express consent of the defendant, a stage short of either 
acquittal or conviction.  In specifying the grounds of a motion to 
quash, it was explicitly set forth therein that even prior to such a 
disposition of the case as above indicated, once jeopardy has attached, a
 motion to quash would lie.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the mind of the Court, the resolution of the instant Petition depends
 on the correct and proper interpretation and application of the phrase 
"dismissed or otherwise terminated without the express consent of the 
defendant" in Section 9, Rule 117, Rules of Court.
</p><p>
The Solicitor General, in his Memorandum for the Petitioner, contends 
that the aforementioned provision contemplates a dismissal which finally
 terminates and definitely disposes of a case, not a provisional or 
conditional dismissal such as that ordered by the Municipal Court in the
 case at bar.  The Government counsel argues that while the Municipal 
Court dismissed the complaint for serious physical injuries, the very 
Order of dismissal shows that it was to be without prejudice, "to give 
way to the filing of a complaint for frustrated murder" in the Court of 
First Instance.  Such a dismissal, it is submitted, is not within the 
purview of the double jeopardy provision hereinabove cited.  The 
Solicitor General concludes that the Order of the Court of First 
Instance in question granting the Motion to quash filed by the defense 
is erroneous, invalid, and a nullity, for it deprived the State of its 
day in court and its duty to prosecute the accused Edgardo Caballas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>
On the other hand, the thrust of private respondent's arguments is that 
the literal language of the subject provision should be made to prevail,
 i.e., it is the absence of the express consent of the defendant to the 
dismissal or termination of the original criminal case which bars a 
subsequent prosecution, and wanting such express consent, jeopardy 
immediately and irrevocably attaches regardless of the nature or 
character of the dismissal or termination of the case.  Private 
respondent contends that if a criminal case is dismissed otherwise than 
upon the merits at any stage before judgment without the express consent
 of the defendant, assuming that all the other requisites of Section 9, 
Rule 117 are present, the dismissal of the case shall be definite and a 
bar to another prosecution for the same offense.  Thus, it is argued 
that although the Municipal Court dismissed the first case for serious 
physical injuries "to give way to the filing of a complaint for 
frustrated murder" in the Court of First Instance, said dismissal was 
nevertheless definite and unconditional in law because it was ordered 
without the express consent of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
A review of jurisprudence defining double jeopardy is necessary to resolve the legal issue.
</p><p>
In the case of <em>Jaca vs. Blanco</em>, 86 Phil. 452 (1950), this Court held that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x the dismissal contemplated in the above-quoted section of 
the rule (referring to Section 9, Rule 113 of the old Rules of Court, 
now Section 9, Rule 117 of the Revised Rules of Court) is a definite or 
unconditional dismissal which terminates the case, and not a dismissal 
without prejudice as in the present case.  In the absence of any 
statutory provision to the contrary, we find no reason why the court may
 not, in the interest of justice, dismiss a criminal case provisionally,
 i.e., without prejudice to reinstating it before the order becomes 
final or to the subsequent filing of a new information for the same 
offense." (Page 454.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <em>Jaca</em> ruling was reiterated in <em>People vs. Manlapas, et al.</em>, L-17993, August 24, 1962, 5 SCRA 883, 887; <em>Republic vs. Agoncillo, et al.,</em> L-27257, August 31, 1971, 40 SCRA 579, 587; and <em>People vs. Hon. Surtida, et al.,</em> L-24420, January 26, 1972, 43 SCRA 29, 37.  Moreover, as stated in the aforementioned case of <em>Republic vs. Agon­cillo, et al. </em>(<em>supra</em>, p. 588):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x the authoritative pronouncement in the x x x case of People <em>vs.</em>
 Obsania (L-24447, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1249), with Justice Castro as 
ponente, had made clear beyond doubt that for dismissal to be a bar 
under the jeopardy clause of the Constitution, it must have the effect 
of an acquittal.  Thus:  'The appealed order of dismissal in this case 
now under consideration did not terminate the action on the merits, 
whereas in Cloribel and in the other related cases the dismissal 
amounted to an acquittal because the failure to prosecute pre­supposed 
that the Government did not have a case against the accused, who in the 
first place, is presumed innocent.' "
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There can be no question, as indeed it is quite clear, that in the case 
at bar, the Order of dismissal issued by the Municipal Court did not 
actually terminate or put an end to the prosecution against herein 
private respondent for the felonious act he was alleged to have 
committed.  On the contrary, the dispositive portion of said Order 
expressly directed that the records of the case be forwarded to the 
Court of First Instance so that the Office of the Provincial Fiscal 
could file a complaint for frustrated murder.
</p><p>
Private respondent, however, insists that the dismissal must be 
considered in legal contemplation as a judgment of acquittal, calling 
attention to the state­ment of the Municipal Court in its dismissal 
Order that "there is reason to believe that the accused Edgardo Caballas
 <em>might </em>have been the one who committed the same" (Italics 
supplied by private respondent).  This declaration, according to private
 respondent, gives rise to the inference that the evidence presented by 
the prosecution as to the identity of the offender fell short of proof 
beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore, he, as the accused, was entitled
 as a matter of right to a judgment of acquittal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  The inference is baseless and contrary to the express language of the 
subject Order.  It is evident from a perusal of the Order of dismissal 
that the Municipal Court found private respondent guilty of the crime of
 frustrated murder but refrained from rendering a judgment of conviction
 on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over the offense proved by the 
evidence presented.  It was precisely on the basis of this finding of 
guilt that the Municipal Court directed that a complaint for frustrated 
murder be filed against private respondent in the Court of First 
Instance.
</p><p>
In a number of cases, this Court has held a dismissal equivalent to an 
acquittal on the merits, and consequently, a bar to a subsequent 
prosecution for the same offense or an offense which necessarily 
includes or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former
 complaint, but in said cases, the dismissal had been predicated either 
on the failure of the pro­secution to prove the guilt of the accused 
beyond rea­sonable doubt,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  or on the right of the accused to a speedy trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>
  In the instant case, the right of private respondent as an accused to a
 speedy trial had never been invoked.  Nor did the Municipal Court find 
that the prosecution failed to prove the guilt of private respondent 
beyond reasonable doubt for in fact said Court in effect stated that 
private respondent was guilty, not only of the crime charged of serious 
physical injuries, but of the graver offense of frustrated murder.  
There is, therefore, no reason why the dismissal Order of the Municipal 
Court should be deemed as a judgment of acquittal of the charge for 
serious physical injuries.
</p><p>
The fundamental question then in the case at bar is:  Was the dismissal 
Order terminating the case before respondent Judge legal and valid?  The
 answer is No.  We hold and rule that respondent Judge erred in 
dismissing the case for serious physical injuries "to give way to the 
filing of a complaint for frustrated murder." For it is the duty of the 
respondent Judge to render the decision as the evidence presented 
warrant under the information as filed for serious physical injuries, 
and not dismiss the case on his idea or belief that there was evidence 
of intent to kill the intended victim.  The Judge committed grave abuse 
of discretion amounting to excess of juris­diction thereby rendering his
 Order of November 29, 1972 null and void.
</p><p>
In the case of People <em>vs.</em> Cabero, 61 Phil. 121, the trial court
 dismissed the complaint or information on the ground that the facts 
alleged in the information filed in the case do not constitute perjury 
or a violation of the provisions of Article 183 of the Revised Penal 
Code.  The Solicitor General appealed from the Order of dismissal.  The 
Supreme Court, in setting aside the Order appealed from and declared of 
no value, the case remanded to the court of origin for an orderly 
determination of the case in the manner provided by law, said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Although not within the express language, there are many known 
exceptions to the jeopardy rule that have from time to time been 
declared by the court.  Had the occasion arisen, it is just as 
reasonable to suppose that an exception to the rule would have been 
declared from an unlawful action of the court as it would for the 
existence of an exception in case of the insanity of the judge.  The 
accused is no more harmed in the one case than in the other. </p>
  <p> Even if following the Ylagan case we should ultimately hold that 
the accused was placed in jeopardy by her plea we must hold that the 
proceedings have not been terminated, as the action of the trial court 
was without authority and therefore null and void."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Since the order of dismissal was without authority and, therefore, null 
and void, the proceedings before the Municipal Court have not been 
lawfully terminated.  Accordingly, there is no second proceeding to 
speak of and no double jeopardy.  A continuation of the proceedings 
against the accused for serious physical injuries is in order for as the
 Supreme Court said in Flores, Jr. <em>vs.</em> Enrile, 115 SCRA 236:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The constitutional mandate against putting a person twice in 
jeopardy of pu­nishment for the same offense is to protect the accused 
from going through a trial a second time.  But, since the first 
proceedings has not yet been terminated, other is no second proceeding 
to speak of, and, therefore, no double jeopardy."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby 
DISMISSED.  The Order of respondent Judge dated October 25, 1973 
quashing the information for frustrated murder is hereby AFFIRMED.  The 
case is, however, REMANDED to the Municipal Trial Court of Lopez, Quezon
 for the proper and orderly decision on the charge for serious physical 
injuries.  Costs de oficio.

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
MAKASIAR, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
There is double jeopardy.
</p><p>
The records show that the accused Edgardo Caballas was charged in the 
defunct Municipal Court of Lopez, Quezon on December 27, 1971 for 
serious physical injuries (p. 27, rec.).  Upon arraignment on February 
5, 1972, the accused pleaded not guilty (p. 35, CFI rec.).  After trial 
on the merits, the case was submitted for decision.  No decision was 
rendered by the Municipal Trial Court judge.  Instead, an order dated 
November 29, 1972 was issued, the perti­nent portions of which are as 
follows:
</p><p>
"The Court believes that the foregoing evidence would support <em>prima facie</em> a complaint for the crime of frustrated murder, and, as stated, prevents it from entering judgment in this case.  xx xx
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, this case is hereby dismissed to 
give way to the filing of a complaint for frustrated murder.  xx xx" 
(pp. 87-89, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On June 6, 1973, an information for frustrated murder was filed in the 
Court of First Instance of Quezon, Branch IV, in compliance with the 
foregoing order (pp. 4 5, rec.).  A motion to quash on the ground of 
double jeopardy was acted upon favorably by the respondent judge in 
favor of the accused.
</p><p>
This Court has held that there is double jeopardy only when all the 
following requisites obtain in the original prosecution:  (a) a valid 
complaint or information; (b) a competent court; (c) the defendant had 
pleaded to the charge; and (d) the defendant was acquitted, or 
convicted, or the case against him was dismissed or otherwise terminated
 without his express consent (Almeda <em>vs.</em> Villaluz, 66 SCRA 46; People <em>vs.</em>
 Obsania, L-24447, June 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 1249, 1254).  If the above 
requisites have been shown to exist in the former prosecution, a 
subsequent action for the same offense would be barred (see Rule 117, 
Sec. 9) on the ground of double jeopardy.
</p><p>
The facts of the case show that the accused was charged with serious 
physical injuries upon a valid indictment, before a competent court and 
he entered a plea of not guilty upon arraignment.
</p><p>
The second question for our consideration is whether or not the first 
jeopardy has terminated.  The majority opinion rules that the dismissal 
is "provisional" in character and therefore, no double jeopardy could be
 appreciated in favor of the accused.  This view finds support in the 
case of Jaca <em>vs.</em> Blanco (86 Phil. 452) and reiterated in the subsequent cases of People <em>vs.</em> Manlapas, et al. (5 SCRA 883), Republic <em>vs.</em> Agoncillo (40 SCRA 579), and People <em>vs.</em> Surtida, et al. (43 SCRA 29).
</p><p>
The facts of the above-mentioned cases are not analogous to the present case.
</p><p>
In Jaca <em>vs.</em> Blanco, <em>supra</em>, the case was called for trial but the fiscal did not appear.  The court then and there dismissed the case <em>without prejudice</em>.
  Four minutes after the order of dismissal, the private prosecutor 
arrived, followed a little later by the City Fiscal together with the 
witnesses for the prosecution.  They explained to the court that their 
tardiness was due to traffic problems.  Satisfied with the explanation, 
the order of dismissal was set aside and the case was reset for trial.  
The High Court held that "in the absence of any statutory provision to 
the contrary, there is no reason why the court may not, in the interest 
of justice, dismiss a criminal case provisionally, i.e., without 
prejudice to re-instating it before the order becomes final or to the 
sub­sequent filing of a new information for the same offense."
</p><p>
In People <em>vs.</em> Manlapas, et al., <em>supra</em>, the defendants 
were charged with attempted rape with robbery before the Justice of the 
Peace Court of Baleno, Masbate.  Having pleaded not guilty to the charge
 and having waived their right to the preliminary investigation, on 
motion of the accused, the court forwarded the record of the case to the
 court of first instance.  The fiscal moved that the case be returned to
 the court of origin for further proceedings on the ground that the 
complaint was not signed by the offended woman.  The case was returned 
as prayed for and a new complaint for attempted rape with robbery was 
subscribed by the offended woman, after which the record was again 
forwarded to the court of first instance, where the fiscal filed the 
corresponding information.  The defendants entered a plea of not guilty.
  The court, finding that no preliminary investigation was conducted by 
the justice of the peace on the amended complaint, <em>motu proprio</em>, dismissed the case "without prejudice to the refiling of the same in the proper court."
</p><p>
Another complaint subscribed by the offended party was filed before the 
Justice of the Peace Court.  The accused waived their right to the 
second stage of the preliminary investigation and the case was forwarded
 to the court of first instance, where the fiscal filed the 
corresponding information.  Thereafter, the court dismissed the case on 
the ground of double jeopardy upon motion of the accused.
</p><p>
The order of dismissal was reversed on appeal by this Court.  Thus, We held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The stand taken by the Court of First Instance when it dismissed the case <em>motu proprio</em>
 'without prejudice to the refiling of the same in the proper court' on 
the wrong premise that the amended complaint was given due course by the
 justice of the peace court without first conducting a preliminary 
investigation, and when the same court granted the motion to quash on 
the ground of double jeopardy after the case was refiled, is erroneous 
because the right to a preliminary investigation, being waivable, does 
not argue against the validity of the proceedings, the most that could 
have been done being to remand the case in order that such investigation
 could be conducted.  The second dismissal is unwarranted, because the 
first dismissal was expressly provided to be without prejudice to the 
refiling of the case in the proper court. </p>
  <p>
    xx                  xx                     xx
  </p>
  <p> "The dismissal by a competent court <em>motu proprio</em> of a 
valid information, after the accused has pleaded not guilty, does not 
bar further prosecution for the same offense under Section 9, Rule 113 
(now Sec. 9, Rule 117) of the Rules of Court, if such dismissal was made
 without prejudice to the refilling of the case in the court" (People <em>vs.</em> Manlapas, et al., <em>supra</em>, 883-­884). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Republic <em>vs.</em> Agoncillo, et al. (40 SCRA 579), this Court, 
speaking through then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice Enrique M. 
Fernando, held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xx It appeared that in the previous case, the lower court judge, taking note that the <em>Solicitor entrusted with the prosecution needed additional time</em>
 for a more thorough study of the case, took such a step, the parties 
thus being chargeable with knowledge that a new action could thereafter 
be filed.  Such dismissal, being <em>without prejudice</em>, the lower 
court in the present suit instituted afterwards ought not to have 
sustained the claim of twice being put in jeopardy.  xx xx" (Italics 
supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In People <em>vs.</em> Surtida, <em>supra</em>, the case was 
"provisionally dismissed" by the trial judge because the Provincial 
Fiscal was not able to attend the hearing.  It was later found out that 
the absence was justified.  WE held that no double jeopardy can be 
pleaded where the dismissal of the criminal prosecution was 
"provisional" and a subsequent prosecu­tion for the same offense can be 
done.
</p><p>
In the cases relied on in the majority opinion, the State has not yet 
presented its evidence when the case was dismissed "without prejudice". 
 The "dismissal without prejudice" in the aforementioned cases merely 
provided for the resurrection of the action to afford the prosecution 
the right to present its side.  The rationale is to afford procedural 
due process to the prosecution in accordance with the maxim <em>Qui aliquid statuerit parte inaudita altera, aequum licet dexerit, haud aequum facerit </em>(He
 who decides anything, one party being unheard, though he should decide 
right, does wrong).  A trial court cannot dismiss outright a case if it 
will lead to the deprivation of due process for the State.
</p><p>
Procedural due process is a fundamental right under the Constitution.  In the case of People <em>vs.</em> Navarro (63 SCRA 265), We held that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xx The State is entitled to due process in criminal cases, that 
is, it must be given the opportunity to present its evi­dence in support
 of the charge.  The Court has always accorded this right to the 
prosecution, and where the right had been denied, had promptly annulled 
the offending court action.  We have heretofore held that a purely 
capricious dismissal of an information deprives the State of fair 
opportunity to prosecute and convict; it denies the prosecution of its 
day in court.  For this reason, it is a dismissal (in reality an 
acquittal) without due process, and, therefore, null and void. </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "Such dismissal is invalid for lack of a fundamental prerequisite,
 that is, due process, and, consequently, will not constitute a proper 
basis for the claim of double jeopardy."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above ruling was consistently adhered to in the case of People <em>vs.</em>
 Pablo (98 SCRA 289) where We held that there is no double jeopardy in a
 case where the order of dismissal or acquittal was made with grave 
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
</p><p>
A denial of due process as in a purely capricious dismissal of an 
information deprives the State of its day in court, and the fair 
opportunity to prosecute and convict (People <em>vs.</em> Gomez, 20 SCRA
 293).  Grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction 
nullifies the proceedings including the order of dismissal itself.  
There could be no double jeopardy to speak of because the requisite of a
 competent court would be lacking.
</p><p>
Denial of a constitutional right -- due process --­ousts the court of jurisdiction.
</p><p>
In the case at hand, however, the trial had already terminated.  Both 
parties had already rested their evidence.  Worse, the case was already 
submitted for decision.  It is crystal clear that the People were not 
deprived of their day in court.
</p><p>
The "dismissal" of the case by the erroneous order of the trial judge 
was a dismissal or termination of the case without the express consent 
of the accused.  The addition of such words "without prejudice," 
"provisionally," or "definitely" to an order of dismissal is a mere 
surplusage if the legal effect under the law is otherwise (Gandicela <em>vs.</em> Lutero, 88 Phil. 299).
</p><p>
The last question for consideration is whether or not the second indictment for frus­trated murder can be considered a <em>same offense </em>as the first offense of serious physical injuries.
</p><p>
Under the present Rules, there is identity between the two offenses not 
only when the second offense is exactly the same as the first, but also 
when the second offense is an attempt to commit the first or a 
frustration thereof, or when it necessarily includes or is necessarily 
included in the offense charged in the first complaint or information 
(Rule 117, Sec. 9, Rules of Court).
</p><p>
The test for determining whether or not a prosecution for one crime 
constitutes an obstacle to a subsequent action for another crime upon 
the same facts is to inquire whether the facts alleged in the second 
information, if proven, would be sufficient to support the former 
information of which the accused may be acquitted or convicted (People <em>vs.</em> Martinez, 55 Phil. 10).
</p><p>
In other words, <em>the evidence to support the second information 
should have been already existing when the first information or 
complaint was filed.</em>
</p><p>
In the instant case, there can be no denial of the fact that the 
evidence for the second prosecution for frustrated murder already 
existed at the time of the filing of the first complaint for serious 
physical injuries.  Moreover, the offense of serious physical injuries 
is necessarily included in the crime of frustrated murder.
</p><p>
Neither can the theory of supervening facts be made applicable here.  
The doctrine of supervening facts, enunciated in the case of Melo <em>vs.</em> People (85 Phil. 769) and reiterated in the case of People <em>vs.</em> Manolong (85 Phil. 829) has no appli­cability with the facts on record.
</p><p>
In accordance with the principle that a charge bars another which 
necessarily includes or is necessarily included in the former, it has 
been held that:  "As the Government cannot begin with the highest, and 
then go down step by step, bringing the man into jeopardy for every 
dereliction included therein, neither can it begin with the 'lowest and 
ascent to the highest with precisely the same result'" (People <em>vs.</em> Cox, 107 Mich. 435, 438, cited in U.S. <em>vs.</em> Lim Suco, 11 Phil. 484 and People <em>vs.</em> Tarok, 73 Phil. 260).
</p><p>
In the case of Dionaldo <em>vs.</em> Dacuycuy (108 SCRA 736, Oct. 30, 
1981), an amendment of the information to change the crime charged from 
homicide to the more serious offense of murder after the accused had 
pleaded not guilty, was not allowed on the basis of double jeopardy.  
Thus, this Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is admitted that the provision which is relevant to the 
problem is Rule 110, Sec. 13 of the Rules of Court which stipulates: </p>
  <p> "'Section 13.  -- <em>­Amendment </em>-- The information or complaint may be amended, in substance or form, without leave of court, at any <em>time
 before the defendant pleads; and thereafter and during the trial as to 
all matters of form, by leave and at the discretion of the court, when 
the same can be done without prejudice to the rights of the defendant</em>. </p>
  <p> "'<em>If it appears at  any time before judg­ment that a mistake 
has been made in charging the proper offense, the court may dismiss the 
original complaint or information and order the filing of a new one 
charging the proper offense, provided the defendant would not be placed 
thereby in double jeopardy, </em>and may also require the witnesses to give bail for their appearance at the trial.' </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "<em>To amend the information so as to change the crime charged 
from homicide to the more serious offense of murder after the petitioner
 had pleaded not guilty to the former is indubitably proscribed by the 
first paragraph of the abovequoted provision.  For certainly a change 
from homicide to murder is not a matter of form; it is one of substance 
with very serious conse­quences</em>. </p>
  <p> "<em>But can the amendment be justified under the second 
paragraph?  The answer is, No.  For the provision speaks not of 
amendment but of dismissal of the information.</em>  In other words, the
 provision contemplates the filing of a substitute, not an amended 
information.  But, it may be asked, can not the information for homicide
 against the peti­tioner be dismissed since no judgment has yet been 
rendered and another information for murder be filed?  <em>The answer, again, is No. </em>FOR
 THE PETITIONER HAVING PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO HOMICIDE, TO DISMISS THE 
CHARGE AGAINST HIM SO AS TO FILE ANOTHER CHARGE FOR MURDER WILL PLACE 
HIM THEREBY IN DOUBLE JEOPARDY" (Dionaldo <em>vs.</em> Dacuycuy, <em>supra</em>, 738; Italics supplied).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is apparent that the municipal court judge was of the opinion that 
the evidence supports a case for the more serious offense of frustrated 
murder, instead of serious physical injuries as charged in the 
complaint.  However, the dismissal of the case for serious physical 
injuries when the case was submitted for decision after the conclusion 
of the trial to give way to the filing of a complaint for frustrated 
murder (pp. 87-89, rec.) was a dismissal without the express consent of 
the accused.  The second information for frustrated murder placed the 
accused in double jeopardy.  The action of the municipal court judge 
cannot even find justification under <em>Section 12, Rule 119</em> of the Rules of Court.  Said section provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 12.  -- <em>When mistake has been made in charging the proper offense</em>
 -- When it appears at any time after trial has begun and before 
judgment is taken, that a mistake has been made in charging the proper 
offense, <em>and the defendant cannot be convicted of the offense charged</em>,
 nor of any other offense necessarily included there­in, the defendant 
must not be discharged, if there appears to be a good cause to detain 
him in custody, but the court must commit him to answer for the proper 
offense, and may also require the witnesses to give bail for their 
appearance at the trial" (Sec. 12, Rule 119). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 12, Rule 119 cannot apply for the simple reason that the accused
 in the instant case could have been convicted for the offense of 
serious physical injuries in the first indictment.
</p><p>
NEMO BIS PUNITUR AUT VEXATUR PRO DELICTO (No one is to be twice punished or vexed for the same fault or offense).
</p><p>
The dismissal of the second information by respondent Judge Mogol is 
valid and should be sustained.  Hence, this petition should be 
dismissed.
