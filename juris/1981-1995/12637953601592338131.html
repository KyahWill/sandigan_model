				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review on <i>certiorari</i> the decision
and order of the then Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals, in
AC-G.R. No. 68505 which awarded a total amount of P907,220.66 as damages,
including attorney's fees, in favor of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is a registered general partnership engaged in the
construction and repair of vessels with <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span>
facilities at <span class="SpellE">Recodo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> while the private
respondent is a domestic corporation engaged in the coastwise shipping industry
operating for that purpose the vessel M/S <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in December, 1974, the private respondent allegedly
contracted with the petitioner the annual <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span>
and repair of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the ground that the petitioner did not
complete and execute all the work <span class="GramE">necessary</span>, essential
and indispensable to rendering the vessel seaworthy resulting in its
deterioration and total loss, the private respondent filed a complaint against
the petitioner for specific performance and damages with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner denied that there was a perfected contract to
repair <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J between the two parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove its case against the petitioner, the private respondent
tried to establish the following facts:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> As
the need arose, the plaintiff had its vessels <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span>
for repairs at the dockyard <span class="GramE">of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the</span> defendant-appellant in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This business relationship started in 1960's
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1980</st1:date>, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
procedure was for these vessels to be <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> and
repaired and after each job, a statement of account would be sent to the
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, which remitted payments to the
defendant-appellant in varying amounts (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although Exhibit 9 consolidates the accounts
pertaining to the <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> J and the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, in point of fact, statements were separately
prepared for said vessels.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because the business relationship between the parties herein
had continued for over 10 years, the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
enjoyed credit facilities from the defendant-appellant and the defendant
performed repair work on the plaintiff's vessel without need of a formal
written contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the strength of
this relationship, the plaintiff, sometime in December, 1974 brought the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J to the defendant-appellant's dockyard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant-appellant asked for a deposit
of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> but even without having received <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this amount that it had requested, the </span>defendant-appellant
<span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> the vessel on <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1974</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1980</st1:date>, p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sum of P15,000.00 was received by the
defendant on December 28, 1974 for which it issued two receipts, one for
P5,000.00 and the other for P10,000.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"A" and "B").</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"With this payment, the defendant commenced work on the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J by removing the rudders, pulled out tail shafts
with propellers, etc., removed bottom hull <span class="SpellE">plankings</span>
in way of inspecting ribs, and replaced same with new <span class="SpellE">plankings</span>,
etc. (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., ibid, pp. 112, 126, 134, 135)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"The plaintiff, even
before the </span><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J was <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span>,
also shipped various lumber materials to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to the defendant-appellant, through Luis Canto, in accordance with instructions
from, and based on specifications of the defendant (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">D, E, F, G, and all <span class="SpellE">submarkings</span>, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. </span><st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 14, 1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, pp. 25-30,
pp. 31-34).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"For some excuse or other, the defendant did not continue the
job on the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it undocked the vessel on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1975</st1:date> and left it exposed
to the elements where it remained until it became a total loss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This suit was therefore filed to call the
defendant-appellant to account for its failure to comply with its obligation to
repair the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> vessel which failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">resulted in damages to the plaintiff- <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>." (pp. 36-37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the petitioner denied responsibility for the
total loss of the vessel M/S <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J and stated
the facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">Its</span> business name is VARADERO DE

the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">VARADERO DE RECODO was <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was </span><span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> on <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="12">December
 27, 1974</st1:date>, after plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> paid
P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, representing partial payment of its old
accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conformably with the written
application filed by plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> with the
Coast Guard, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, inspector Anton <span class="SpellE">Casimero</span>, inspected the vessel <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J
on <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Present during the inspection were Messrs.
Ricardo Tong and Joaquin Tong, representatives of defendant-appellant and Mr.
Luis Canto, representative of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While admittedly the man of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, Mr. Luis Canto had no
authority to enter into a contract with defendant-appellant for the repair of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
of the extensive repair to be done on the vessel, defendant-appellant prepared
a written contract for the signature of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
authorized representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said
written contract, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was to have
deposited with defendant-appellant the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
among others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Luis Canto, man of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, was informed on several
occasions by defendant-appellant to get in touch with his employer in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the purpose being was (sic) for plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
representative to see for himself the extent of the deterioration of the vessel
and to sign the written contract prepared by defendant-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No authorized representative of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> came to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It sent, however, several telegrams to
defendant-appellant demanding, among others, that defendant-appellant repair
the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, there being an earlier agreement
between defendant-appellant and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Protacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juliano</span>, authorized representative of plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, defendant-appellant advised plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to send its authorized representative to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to see for himself the extent of the deterioration of the vessel <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, and insisted, among others, that it had no
contract with plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the repair of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
addition thereto, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> never bothered
to secure the JOB ORDER from the Coast Guard, it being its duty to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vessel was undocked on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1975</st1:date>, and the following
day, defendant-appellant sent plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> a
Statement of Account in the amount of P13<span class="GramE">,134.95</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of this amount P9<span class="GramE">,800.00</span>
represented expenses for dock rental and for the docking and undocking of the
vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The balance of the amount
represented expenses for labor and materials used in closing the open sections
of the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without these latter
expenses, the vessel <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J could not have been
REFLOATED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J
was not repaired and it is now a total loss." <span class="GramE">(pp. 2-4,
Appellant's Brief).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lower court ruled in favor of the private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

</span>It based its ruling on the following circumstances:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) The previous transactions and business
relationship between the two parties showed that they never executed written
contracts for the repair of vessels owned by the private respondent; 2) The
procedure for necessary repairs of the private respondent's vessels consisted
only in the <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span> of the vessel at the
petitioner's shipyard to be repaired by the latter after which the bill would
be sent to the former for the payment; 3) In the case of the contract to repair
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, this vessel was accepted by the
petitioner and it was <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> on December 27, 1974;
4) A day after, or on December 28, 1974, the private respondent paid P15,000.00
in the form of two (2) checks as initial deposit for the repair of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J; 5) There was a job order from the Coast Guard
as evidenced by the application for <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span>
(Exhibit C) and the admitted inspection of the vessel by the Coast Guard in the
presence of Mr. Joaquin Tong, a managing partner of the <span class="SpellE">Varadero</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Recodo</span>, the business name of the petitioner; and
6) The petitioner actually commenced the repair of the vessel when it removed
the rudders and pulled out the tail shafts and did other things.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that the "jurisdiction of this Court in

the private respondent's vessels were all oral and that the procedure consisted
merely in the vessels being <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> at the
petitioner's shipyard and after repair the petitioner would just send the bill
to the private respondent, does not necessarily result in a conclusive
presumption that all subsequent contracts between the parties of similar or
allied nature should also be oral and the procedure be the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the records reveals that there are
circumstances overlooked by the appellate court which support the petitioner's
contentions that -- 1) there was no perfected contract between the parties to
repair <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, and 2) the proximate cause of the
total loss of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J was the abandonment of the
vessel by the private respondent.</p>

inspector, Anton <span class="SpellE">Casimero</span>, in the presence of Mr.
Luis Canto, the private respondent's representative, and Mr. Joaquin Tong,

deteriorated that in order to repair it, all the original ribs of the boat and

<p class="BODY">These undisputed facts give credence to the petitioner's

</span>the P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was partial settlement of
previous accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking into
consideration the petitioner's previous experiences together with the private
respondent's allegations, it is equally likely that the P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
paid by the latter on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="12">December <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">28, </span>1974</st1:date> was only a
condition precedent to the acceptance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J
for <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span> and not a <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span>
for its repair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
petitioner in its contentions:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> That the payment of P15,000 on December 28, 1974 could
not have possibly been for the repairs of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J
is confirmed no <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">less </span>than by the
very findings of the trial court when it stated that 'the procedure that was
followed was for the vessels of plaintiff (herein private respondent) to be <span class="SpellE">drydocked</span> and repaired and after (sic) job, the statements
of account will be sent to plaintiff and in turn, the plaintiff will remit
payment to the defendant (herein petitioner) in varying amounts' (p. 182,
R.A.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Following this reasoning, and
concededly since the work on the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J had not
yet even commenced, then the P15,000 payment on December 28, 1974 could only
pertain to the partial settlement of private respondent's previous unpaid
accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that the
two receipts marked as Exhibits A and B issued on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="12">December <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">28, </span>1974</st1:date>
for P15<span class="GramE">,000</span> made no specific mention that these were
in payment for the repairs of the <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>As</u> <u>a</u> <u>matter</u> <u>of</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><u>fact,</u> <u>private</u> <u>respondent</u>
<u>admits</u> <u>that</u> <u>no</u> <u>such</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>downpayment</u></span>
<u>had</u> <u>been</u> <u>required</u> <u>for</u> <u>past</u> <u>repairs</u> <u>with</u>
<u>the</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><u>shipyard.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's submission is further strengthened when we
consider that no estimate of the expenses for repairs to be incurred had as yet
been made on the vessel <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J on December 28,
1974 (one day after the vessel was admitted for <span class="SpellE">drydocking</span>)
and petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">would have no basis for
requesting an </span>immediate <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that it was only on <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1975</st1:date> when a Coast Guard
inspector conducted an ocular inspection of the vessel in the presence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Luis Canto, private respondent's
representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Logically, it was only
at that time (January 2, 1975) that the shipyard was appraised of the work to
be done on the vessel and for this reason, said petitioner demanded for a
P50,000 <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span>, not P15,000 as claimed by private
respondent." (p. 24, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

January 17, January 20, and January 28, 1975 sent by the petitioner to the
private respondent, however, indicate that the former had not accepted the
repair of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span>-J, the reason being that the
