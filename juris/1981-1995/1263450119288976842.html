<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by the Court of Appeals, are:</p>

<blockquote>"Before <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="4">April 30,
 1974</st1:date>, private respondents were the owners of certain construction
equipment and being in need of financing, they went to the Investors' Finance
Corporation (FNCB Finance) with their equipment as collateral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the appropriate documents which were executed,
it was made to appear that FNCB was the owner of the equipments and that
private respondents were merely leasing them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consideration for the lease, private respondents were to pay
monthly amortization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that on April
30, 1974, petitioner FNCB Finance and respondent <span class="SpellE">Richmann</span>
Tractors, Inc. executed a 'Lease Agreement' (Annex "A", Petition)
covering various properties described in the Lease Schedules attached to the
Lease Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As security for the
payment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Richmann's</span> obligations under
the Lease Agreement, respondent Ricardo B. <span class="SpellE">Pajarillaga</span>
and Ella P. <span class="SpellE">Pajarillaga</span> (respondent spouses) executed
a Continuing Guaranty dated April 30, 1974 (Annex "B", Petition).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On May 20, 1976, respondent <span class="SpellE">Richmann</span>
also applied for and was granted credit and financing facilities by petitioner
in the amount of P977,034.88, payable in 24 equal monthly installments
commencing on June 20, 1976 and every month thereafter until fully paid, as
evidence by the Non-Negotiable Promissory Note (Annex "C", Petition)
executed by said respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payment
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Richmann's</span> obligations under said
Promissory Note is secured by a Continuing Guaranty dated July 31, 1974 (Annex
"D", Petition) executed by respondent spouses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Private respondents defaulted in their respective obligations
under the Lease Agreement, Non-Negotiable Promissory Note and the two (2) Deeds
of Continuing Guaranty aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon their failure to pay said defaulted obligations notwithstanding
petitioner FNCB Finance's demands, the latter filed a complaint (Annex
"E", Petition) for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> and sum of
money, on <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>,
against said respondents, which case was docketed as Civil Case No. 29671.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1978</st1:date>,
Branch XXI issued a writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> for the seizure
of the properties covered by the Lease Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, private respondents executed with
Petitioner FNCB Finance a Compromise Agreement dated June, 1978 (Annex
"F", Petition) which was, in turn, filed with Branch XXI on <st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1978</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Acting upon the said Compromise Agreement, Branch XXI issued
a Decision oh <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1978</st1:date>
(Annex "G", Petition) approving the compromise agreement and
enjoining the parties thereto to faithfully comply with the terms and
conditions thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Private respondents breached their obligations under the
Compromise Agreement whereupon petitioner FNCB Finance, thru counsel, filed an
Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion for Execution (Annex "H",
Petition) on December 11, 1978, which was granted by Branch XXI, as shown by
the Order dated January 4, 1978 (Annex "I", Petition) issued by Judge
Pineda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same Order, Judge Pineda
directed the issuance of a writ of execution and ordered petitioner Sheriff to
enforce said writ thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1979</st1:date>, the writ of execution
(Annex "J", Petition) was issued.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners contend
that there is no parallel­ism and no congruence between the <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span>
case and the instant case because "In the instant </span>case, <span style="">the complaint filed by petitioner FNCB <span class="SpellE">Fiannce</span> in Civil Case No. 29671 <u>has not yet been finally

<span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, as in fact the writ of execution was still in

herein filed their complaint for annulment of judgment with Branch V of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondents submit
that Civil Case No. Q-29671, entitled "Investors' Finance Corporation,
etc. et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Richmann</span> Tractors, Inc., et al."
was already terminated when Civil Case No. Q-26754 was filed before Branch V of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City) because nothing was left to be done but to
enforce the judgment therein which had become final and <span class="SpellE">execu­tory</span>
and that the Court of First Instance presided by Judge Pineda could no longer
grant the relief sought by the herein private respondents, plaintiffs in Civil
Case No. Q-26754.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The submission of the
private respondents is supported by decisions of this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is settled that a
court of first instance or a branch thereof has jurisdiction to annul a final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered by another court of
first instance or branch of the same court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span> vs. Court of Appeals</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the Supreme Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In an action to annul the judgment of a court, the
plaintiff's cause of action springs from the alleged nullity of the judgment
based on one ground or another, particularly fraud, <span style="">which fact affords the plaintiff a right to judicial interference in
his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a suit the cause of
action is entirely different from that in the action which gave rise to the
judgment sought to be annulled, for a direct attack against a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment is not incidental to, but is the main
object of, the proceeding."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">"To hold that a court or a branch
thereof has no authority or jurisdiction to annul a judgment simply because
that judgment was rendered by another branch, would, therefore practically

<p class="BODY">Judge Eduardo C. <span class="SpellE">Tutaan</span>, therefore, has
jurisdiction to take cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-26754 seeking to annul the
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered by Judge
Gregorio Pineda in Civil Case No. 29671 and to issue the order of <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1979</st1:date> temporarily
restraining the sheriff from proceeding with the execution of the judgment of
said Judge Pineda.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is contended by the petitioners that the action to annul the
judgment is premature because Civil Case No. 29671 before Judge Pineda was not
yet terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a fact that the decision of Judge Pineda in Civil Case No. 29671
had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed the sheriff was already in the process
of executing said judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Pineda
could no longer grant the relief prayed for by the private respondents in Civil
Case No. Q-26754.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

"Once a court renders a final judgment, all the issues between or among
the parties before it are deemed resolved and its judicial function as regards
any matter related to the controversy litigated comes to an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The execution of its judgment is purely a
ministerial phase of adjudication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed
the nature of its duty to <span style="">see </span>to
it that the claim of the prevailing party is fully satisfied from the
properties of the loser is generally ministerial."</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the second error assigned is not
meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the duty of the
respondent judge to proceed with the trial of Civil Case No. Q-26754 over which
he has jurisdiction.</p>
