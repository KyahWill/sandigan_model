</span>the election if held and restrain the enforcement of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">results; </span>and to hold public
respondents in contempt of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">originated
</span>with a petition filed on <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="12">December
 2, 1984</st1:date> by San <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Miguel </span>Corporation
Employees Union with the Department of Labor and Employment for the election of
its officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The last election
conducted in the union was in December 1981 when <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>, Jr. was elected president of the union for
a term of three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the required pre-election conferences, the election was
scheduled on <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, a restraining order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1984</st1:date>, issued by the
National Capital Region, Metro <span class="GramE">Manila,</span> (NCR for
brevity) suspended the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless the group of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Bandal</span>, one
of the contending parties proceeded with the election and won.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was questioned by <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> as the election was conducted in violation
of the restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NCR
sustained <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> and the <span class="SpellE">Bandal</span>
group appealed to the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR for brevity).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July
 22, 1985</st1:date>, the BLR dismissed the appeal and ordered the holding of
another election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This order became
final and so the parties were again summoned for pre-election <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conferences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, another date for the election </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">set, this time </span>on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">November 25, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, however, protracted legal debates delayed the implementation
of the BLR order for the holding of election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> raised the issue that the unit </span>should
be described as "SMCEU - PTGWO" instead of SMCEU only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After his belated motion for the
reconsideration of the <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 22, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> order of the BLR which was denied, he came
to </span>this Court by way of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for
the issuance of a restraining order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>enjoin
the holding of the election which was re-scheduled anew to <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the petition he also prayed that the
acronym PTGWO be added to SMCEU.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This court restrained the
holding of the scheduled election </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
allowed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the inclusion of PTGWO
as suffix to SMCEU.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From this Court, the case was remanded to the NCR <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
being no further legal impediment to the holding of the elections, the NCR
again called the parties for the continuance of the pre-election conference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, having a change of mind due perhaps to considerations
of union politics, <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> submitted to the Med­-Arbiter
two (2) motions dated <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1986</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1986</st1:date>,
praying for the dismissal of the petition which the petitioners filed with the
Department of Labor and Employment on <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="12">December
 2, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
insisted that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">view of the on-going collective bargaining
negotiations between the union and San Miguel Corporation, it would be in the
interest of everybody that said negotiations be concluded first before holding
the election.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The NCR accommodated <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
repeatedly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But after the signing of the
Collective Bargaining Agreement, another pre-election conference was called on <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1987</st1:date>, the Med-Arbiter issued an Order the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

Med-Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without waiting for its
resolution, petitioners filed the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> (G.R.
No. 80141) and in their petition they did not mention the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the election <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the said election protest was dismissed for lack of merit,
the petitioners elevated the same to this Court by way of another petition for <i>certiorari</i>
(G.R. No. 82183).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">both petitions </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

consolidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This mockery of judicial
proceedings should not be countenanced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="11">November
 6, 1987</st1:date>, public respondent already declared and certified the
candidates in said election garnering the highest number of votes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the duly
elected officers, committee members and board of directors of SMCEU-PTGWO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the very act of public respondent
that petitioners seek to be restrained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since the act has already been consummated, injunction or restraining
order does not lie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it does
not appear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">th</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">at</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> petitioners are entitled to the main relief sought, so there is no
legal justification for a restraining order or preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that public respondents acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when they set the local
election on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of their allegation, they state
that there was no petition for the holding of election of union officers
meeting the requirements of Book V, Rule VIII, Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the
Implementing Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and Regulations of
the Labor Code and that they were deprived of due process of law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The above contentions are
without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the
requirements as delineated in said Sections 1, 2 and 3 of the Implementing
Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code apply to election of union officers,
petitioners are in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> to invoke the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed the petition praying for the
conduct of an election to select the union officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By filing the petition, they necessarily
affirmed that the petition was sufficient in form and substance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They therefore cannot now claim that the
petition did not meet legal requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent their claim that they were denied due process, records show
that they were given their day in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their motion for Reconsideration/Appeal dated <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1978</st1:date> was duly considered by public
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that their
motion was denied does not mean that they were denied due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Supplemental Petition, petitioners pray that respondent <span class="SpellE">Pura</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer-Calleja</span> and
Med-Arbiter Fernando be held in contempt of court for proceeding to take action
on the petition for election.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="12">December
 9, 1987</st1:date>, this Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining
"respondents from proclaiming the alleged winners in the union local
election held last <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1987</st1:date>

Arbiter in the election protest filed by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the act intended to be restrained was
already "fait accompli." Accordingly, said public respondents have
