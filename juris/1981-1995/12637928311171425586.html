				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the Intermediate
Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals, in AC-G.R. No. SP-02790, which affirmed
the three orders dated <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="11">November 9,
 1983</st1:date> of Judge Pastor T. Reyes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Presid­</span>ing Judge of Branch 166 of the Regional Trial Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the National Capital Region (<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>), in Civil Case No. 35014.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On May 18, 1977,
petitioner Hacienda Benito, Inc., and private respondent Valley Resources, Inc.
entered into a "Mutual Agreement" wherein the former sold to the
latter parcels of land, roads including road rights, land covered by
installment contracts, receivables, and improvements therein in Victoria
Valley, <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for
the price of P6,300,000.00 payable in install­ments.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, May 18, 1977, Robert Phillips, husband of
petitioner Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span> Phillips acting thru his
agent, petitioner Las <span class="SpellE">Rocas</span> Tennis and Country Club,
and private respondent Valley Land Resources, Inc., entered into an
"AGREEMENT FOR THE PURCHASE OF SHARES OF STOCKS" wherein the former
sold to Valley Land Resources, Inc., 200 proprietary shares of stocks of the
Las <span class="SpellE">Rocas</span> Tennis and Country Club, Inc., for the
price of P6<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> also payable in installments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Valley Land Resources allegedly without the
knowledge and consent of the <span class="GramE">petitioners,</span> withdrew the
land titles, subject of the abovementioned "Mutual Agreement" from
the depository banks and had them cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>New titles were then issued in the name of the private respondent which
thereafter sold lots to the public.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1979, the petitioners, prompted by the failure of
the private respondent to execute the two mortgages pursuant to the agreements
filed an amended petition entitled "In the matter of the petition to
direct the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to Annotate
certain Liens and Encumbrances" before the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
Court of First Instance, Branch I (GRLO) LRC Nos. 15233, 12532, 22593 and 13131
(R-2144).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners prayed for the
annotation at the back of the titles involved of pertinent portions of the
Mutual Agreement and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"Agreement
for the purchase of shares of stocks" to serve as warning to prospective
lot buyers that said titles are encumbered, pursuant to sections 72 and 112 of
Act 496.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the said petition in his official capacity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The aforementioned
petition was granted by the court which directed the Register of Deeds to make
the annotation at the back of the transfer certificates of titles upon payment
of the corresponding fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

filed a complaint for "specific perform­ance with damages and judicial
tender of payment" against the petitioners before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch VI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case docketed as Civil Case No. 35014
alleged that the private respondent has performed all its obligations under the
two contracts, particularly the payments of its obligations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
without default, but that Magdalena Y. Phillips, as incumbent president of the
three corporations, deliberately failed and refused to comply with her
duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It asked that upon consignation

a clear error which neither the Court stenographer nor the Branch Clerk of

the release of the deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's charge that the P7,260,000.00 deposit
was released under suspicious circumstances was compounded by the fact that its
re­lease to petitioner Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span> Phillips was
done on May 18, 1983, or two days prior to the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

harbor suspicion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge Reyes, however,
exonerated himself from any involvement in the release of the P7<span class="GramE">,260,000.00</span> by stating that:</p>

at 4:30 o'clock p.m. on May 20, 1983 after the deposit had already been
withdrawn by defendants through Magdalena Y. Phillips, the Court finds this
matter regrettable and unpardonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
its face, it appears to be a deliberate act on the part of the person or person
responsible for deli­very of copies of the Order and/or the withdrawal of the
deposit to deprive plaintiff the right to resort to legal action to enjoin the
withdrawal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With­out knowing the exact
date when said Order was signed which can not be earlier than May 5, 1983 (date
of the filing of defendants' 'Comments on Compromise Agreement') nor later than
May 17, 1983 (date of departure for abroad of the Presiding Judge, he
personally delivers it to the Branch Clerk of Court for immediate release.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Presiding Judge was already out of
the country when copies of the Order were delivered to the par­ties and their
counsel as well as the time when the deposit was withdrawn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the Presiding Judge can assure
plaintiff and all concerned that should there be any irregularity or anomaly
any person or persons including any personnel of the Court who, in one way or
the other, is/are connected therewith or received some consideration or promise
thereof, the Presiding Judge upon request of plaintiff, shall take the

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, we note that a main issue<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>raised in the case pertains to a May
18, 1977 "Mutual Agreement" executed by petitioner Hacienda Benito,
Inc., and private respondent Valley Land Resources Inc., wherein the former
sold to the latter parcels of lands, roads, including road rights, land covered
by installment contracts <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">re</span>ceivables,

or not this agreement is legal and binding between the parties is one of the
issues to be resolved in Civil Case No. 35014.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, we take note of G.R. No. 50911, <u>Miguel Perez
Rubio v. Court of Appeals, et al</u>., decided by this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 50911 involves shares of stock of the petitioner herein,
Hacienda Benito which were sold by Miguel Perez Rubio to Robert O. Phillips and
Sons, Inc., (ROPSI) for P5<span class="GramE">,500,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ROPSI was not able to pay P4<span class="GramE">,250,000.00</span> of the purchase price resulting in two other
cases involving Perez Rubio, ROPSI, Spouses Robert Phillips and Magdalena Y.
Phillips, major stockholders of ROPSI and Hacienda Benito among others, which
reached this Court earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(G.R. Nos.
L-24581; L-30404) <span class="GramE">In</span> all these cases, it was clearly
shown that ROPSI tried to sell the shares of stock of Hacienda Benito without
first paying its unpaid balance to Perez Rubio.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in G</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">.</span>R. No. 50911, we ruled that Robert O.
Phillips and Sons and the Phillips spouses are to be jointly and severally
