the Solicitor General are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"In 1967, CAREBI secured a loan from petitioner DBP,
constituting a mortgage on its sugar mill-refinery in <span class="SpellE">Botolan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1977</st1:date>, and upon failure of
CAREBI to pay, DBP instituted a foreclosure sale of the property in which DBP
itself was the highest bidder (Records, Motion for Reconsideration, Annex A; Certificate
of Sale, pp. 000113-23).</p>

<p class="2Q">After the sale, CAREBI continued to manage and operate the business
until it finally ceased operation on <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">April </span>30, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same day, CAREBI laid off
respondent-employees then working in the sugar mill-refinery without, however,
paying their separation benefits.</p>

that should the net cash balance from <span class="SpellE">CAREBI's</span> operations
be less than P200,000.00 (equivalent to the management fee for eight month's
milling period at P25,000.00 per month), then such smaller balance is all that
shall be paid to CSC as management fee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
