This is an automatic review of the decision of the defunct Court of 
First Instance of Misamis Oriental in Criminal Case No. 52-M which 
imposed the death penalty.
<p>
RAFAEL SAYLAN was accused of the crime of rape in the sworn complaint of Eutropia Agno said to have been committed as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 23rd day of January, 1972, at more or less 
7:00 o'clock in the evening, at Sitio Craser, Malinao, Gingoog City, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the 
above-named accused, with deliberate intent to have sexual intercourse, 
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and criminally with the use of a
 dagger, force and intimidate Eutropia Agno y Arcay, to remove her 
pantie and to lay down on the ground and with the use of a dagger, force
 and intimidation succeeded in having sexual intercourse with Eutropia 
Agno y Arcay, a woman of good reputation and against her will. That the 
commission of the foregoing offense was attended by the aggravating 
circumstances of: abuse of superior strength, nighttime, uninhabited 
place, ignominy and <em>reiteracion</em>." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 27.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused entered a plea of "not guilty" and after trial the court rendered the following judgment:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable 
doubt of the crime of rape, penalized under Article 335 of the Revised 
Penal Code as amended by Republic Act No. 4111, and the commission of 
the offense having been attended by three aggravating without any 
mitigating circumstance, hereby sentences him to suffer the supreme 
penalty of death, to indemnify the offended party in the amount of Six 
Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00), and to pay the costs. In view of the fact 
that the offended party is a married woman, aside from the fact that she
 has not become pregnant as a result of the commission of the rape, the 
Court makes no pronouncement as to acknowledgment and support of 
offspring." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 64.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The factual version of the prosecution is summarized in the People's brief as follows:
</p><p>
"The complaining witness, Eutropia A. Agno, a married woman and a 
resident of Barrio Malinao, Gingoog City, was a classroom teacher of the
 MaliÂ­nao Elementary School (pp. 2, 3, tsn., Feb. 22, 1973).
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In the afternoon of January 23, 1971, Eutropia went to the public
 market in Gingoog City to buy foodstuffs for her family and thereafter,
 she proceeded to the store of her mother to fetch her five-year old 
daughter Nilsonita (p. 4, tsn., Id.). On their way home, Eutropia and 
Nilsonita boarded a passenger jeepney and while inside the vehicle she 
(Eutropia) noticed that the other passengers were Rudy Gonzales, a grade
 I pupil of the Malinao Elementary School, the appellant, Rafael Saylan,
 and a couple whom she did not know (pp. 5, 6, tsn., Id. ). The jeepney 
went only as far as Malinas citrus farm because the road to Barrio 
Malinao was not passable by vehicles (p. 5, tsn., Id.). It was almost 
6:30 o'clock in the evening when the jeepney arrived at the Malinas 
citrus farm and so all the passengers alighted and had to walk all the 
way to Barrio Malinao which was about three and a half kilometers away 
(p. 5, tsn., Id.). After walking some distance and upon reaching a 
junction, the couple separated from the group and took the road leading 
to their house while Eutropia's group took the opposite road (p. 9, 
tsn., Id.). The appellant, however, joined the group of Eutropia and 
when they reached the place where the road was plain, appellant who was 
then walking side by side with Eutropia suddenly pulled out a dagger 
about eight inches long and pointing it at the latter said, 'Do not 
shout, Nang, I will kill you!' (pp. 11, 12, tsn., Id. ). At this 
juncture, appellant placed his right arm around the neck of Eutropia 
with the dagger pointed at her left breast (p. 12, tsn., Id.), after 
which he dragged Eutropia at some distance. When they reached the 
junction of the trail for men and a trail for carabaos, he ordered 
everybody to stop and told the children (Nilsonita and Rudy Gonzales) to
 stay behind and threatened to kill them if they persisted in following 
them (pp. 17, 18, tsn., Id.). Thereafter, appellant again dragged 
Eutropia by her hand and brought her towards a creek near a coconut tree
 which was about five meters away from where Nilsonita and Rudy Gonzales
 were (pp. 14, 15, 16, tsn., Id.). The appellant then ordered Eutropia 
to remove her panty which she refused at first, but appellant threatened
 to kill her, so she removed her panty after which appellant ordered her
 to lie down (pp. 18, 19, tsn., Id. ). Subsequently, appellant placed 
himself on top of the victim and inserted his penis into her vagina and 
succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her by moving his buttocks 
up and down (pp. 20, 21, tsn., Id.). </p>
  <p> "After the first sexual act, appellant ordered Eutropia to stand 
up which the latter helplessly and grudgingly followed (p. 23, tsn., 
Id.). Appellant again inserted his penis into her vagina and then 
performed a push and pull movement (pp. 23, 24, 25, tsn., Id.). Not 
satisfied with the second intercourse, appellant ordered Eutropia to lie
 down again preparatory to a third intercourse (p. 26, tsn., Id.). 
Appellant again performed the sexual act with her (pp. 26, 27, tsn., 
Id.). </p>
  <p> "After the third intercourse, appellant ordered Eutropia to stand 
up and then he bent her body downwards with her hands and knees resting 
on the ground (p. 28, tsn., Id.). When the latter was already in this 
position, appellant then placed himself behind her, inserted his penis 
into her vagina and executed a push and pull movement in the dog's way 
of sexual intercourse (pp. 27, 28, tsn., Id. ). </p>
  <p> "After performing this uncommon way of sexual intercourse, 
appellant ordered Eutropia to lie down again which the latter 
reluctantly obeyed because appellant's dagger was always pointed at her 
and thereafter he had carnal knowledge of her for the fifth time (pp. 
29, 30, tsn., Id. ). </p>
  <p> "After the fifth intercourse, and after satisfying his sexual 
lust, appellant asked Eutropia if she will tell her husband what he did 
to her and the latter answered, 'I will not tell' (p., 31, tsn., Id.). 
But she only said this so that appellant would let her go home (p. 33, 
tsn., Id.). </p>
  <p> "Afterwards, Eutropia and appellant returned to the place where 
the children were left and upon arriving thereat, they found Nilsonita 
(Eutropia's daughter) asleep with Rudy seated dozing beside her (pp. 32,
 33, tsn., Id.). Nilsonita who was sleeping was carried by the appellant
 and then they all proceeded to Malinao (pp. 33, 34, tsn., Id.). </p>
  <p> "After walking some distance, Eutropia saw the house of her friend
 "Ben" and upon approaching the said house, she shouted, 'Ben, Ben, 
please give me hot water' (p. 34, tsn., Id.). Upon hearing her voice, 
Ben, who was still awake at the time, opened the door of his house and 
allowed Eutropia to come up (p. 34, tsn., Id.). Eutropia immediately 
went upstairs and went straight to the room of Ben as she was feeling 
very bad (p. 34, tsn., Id.). Appellant, who was then carrying Nilsonita,
 and Rudy Gonzales, were also allowed to go upstairs (p. 35, tsn., Id.).
 Meanwhile, Eutropia requested Ben to fetch her husband (p. 35, tsn., 
Id.). </p>
  <p> "When Eutropia woke up between 9:00 and 10:00 o'clock that 
evening, her husband was already there (p. 36, tsn., Id.). She then 
asked him whether the appellant was still around, and in reply, he told 
her that appellant had already left (p. 37, tsn., Id.). Eutropia then 
told her husband that she was raped by the appellant (p. 37, tsn., Id.).
 Upon learning of the dastardly act committed by the appellant, he 
advised his wife to submit herself to a medical examination (p. 37, 
tsn., Id.). </p>
  <p> "The following morning, the offended party was brought to the 
office of the City Health Department of Gingoog City where she was 
examined by Dr. Ireneo O. Pascual, who after conducting a thorough 
physical examination, issued a medical certificate with the following 
findings, to wit: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      '(1)   Multiparous.
    </p>
    <p>
      '(2)   Presence of viscid whitish secretions at vaginal fornix.
    </p>
    <p> '(3)   Microscopic examination of secretions reveals epithelial cells, but no spermatozoa identified.' </p>
    <p> (pp. 10, 11, 12, t.s.n., Feb. 24, 1973; Exh. "A"). </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "Rudy Gonzales, a grade I pupil of the Malinao Elementary School 
and one of the witnesses for the prosecution, testified that he met Mrs.
 Eutropia Agno in the afternoon of January 23, 1972 at the public market
 of Gingoog City buying foodstuffs for her family (pp. 2, 3, tsn., Feb. 
26, 1973). On their way back to Barrio Malinao, they boarded a passenger
 jeepney and while he was inside the vehicle, he noticed that the other 
passengers aside from Mrs. Agno, her daughter, and himself were the 
appellant and a couple whose names he did not know (p. 4, tsn., Id. ). 
The jeepney, however, could only travel up to the Malinas Citrus farm 
and so they had to walk all the way to Barrio Malinao (p. 4, tsn., Id.) 
After walking some distance and upon reaching a trail for carabaos, the 
appellant suddenly pulled a dagger and placed his arms around the neck 
of Mrs. Agno and then dragged her towards the carabao trail (pp. 4, 5, 
tsn., Id.). Meanwhile, he and Nilsonita were left behind and they fell 
asleep because it took a long time for the appellant and Mrs. Agno to 
come back for them (p. 5, tsn., Id.). When Mrs. Agno and the appellant 
returned, he was already awake while Nilsonita was still asleep and so 
appelÂ­lant had to carry her in going home to Malinao (p. 6, tsn., Id.). 
After walking some distance, Mrs. Agno saw the house of Mang Ben and 
because she was feeling bad, they all went to the house of Mang Ben 
where Mrs. Agno spent the night (p. 7, tsn., Id. ). Afterwards, he and 
the appellant left the house of Mang Ben and then they proceeded to his 
house at Malinao where both of them slept (pp. 7, 21, tsn., Id. )." (At 
pp. 2-8.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused did not deny having had sexual Intercourse with Mrs. Agno; 
in fact he admitted that he copulated with her for three successive 
times in the early evening of January 23, 1972, but he claimed that it 
was with her consent. Accordingly, he now claims that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.    THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THA THE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
 HAD BEEN COMMITTED AGAINST THE WILL AND CONSENT OF THE COMPLAINANT. </p>
  <p> "II.   THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THAT AGGRAVATING 
CIRCUMSTANCES HAD ACCOMPANIED THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE." (Brief, p.
 5.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The appeal must fail for the reasons stated hereunder.
</p><p>
This is a typical rape case. Only the participants could directly 
testify on the alleged sexual abuse and the accused alleges consent on 
the part of the complainant. The question of credibility arises and 
under the circumstances We have to rely heavily on the determination 
made by the trial judge who observed the demeanor of the witnesses while
 before Us is only the cold transcript of what they said.
</p><p>
We accept the conclusions and findings of fact of the trial court that 
the complainant was in fact raped by the appellant. There is no fact or 
circumstance in the record which will justify a different action.
</p><p>
The claim of the appellant that the sexual intercourse was mutually 
agreed is utterly incredible. If it were true that Mrs. Agno consented 
to have coitus with the appellant, her conduct thereafter defies 
understanding because it is contrary to reason and it has not been shown
 that Mrs. Agno, a school teacher, was bereft of common sense. For if it
 was true that the sexual act was indeed mutually desired and performed 
why did she complain not only to her husband but also to the 
authorities? An affair such as that claimed by the appellant is carried 
out in a discreet manner. On the other hand, the version of the 
complainant has indicia of credibility. For her version bared her shame 
to a small community and her exposure was necessary only because she had
 to reveal the truth. No, We simply cannot believe the appellant's 
version.
</p><p>
We have said above that the findings and conclusions of the trial court 
are entitled to great respect. In finding the appellant guilty, this is 
what the court a quo said in part:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The testimony of the accused is incredible. When he told his love
 to the offended party for the first time, they were only two in the 
latter's house. He had more time with her then. She refused him because 
she is married. He tried for the second time. He was again refused 
because she is married. It is unthinkable and highly improbable that on 
the evening of January 23, 1972, after only three minutes, the offended 
party would rush to accept his love and go to the extent of thanking him
 for his considering her daughter as his own, unless she was coerced, 
threatened, forced and intimated. </p>
  <p> "It is highly improbable for a school teacher with several 
children to exchange her husband only 40 years old and with a good means
 of livelihood for one whom she does not know and whom she has observed 
as doing nothing except to play basketball. It is subversive of the 
traits, character and nature of Filipino women to say that the offended 
party, a school teacher and a girl scout accepted the love of a man who 
is good for nothing and surrendered her whole body and virtue to him 
after an accidental courtship of only three minutes. The offended party 
is an unsophisticated and conservative woman, fixing her hair the old 
fashion way. She does not apply make-up on her face, and her dress is up
 to her knees. This makes the pretensions of the accused all the more 
incredible." (<em>Expediente</em>, p. 59.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The complaint alleges the following aggravating circumstances: abuse of superior strength, nocturnity, <em>despoblado</em>, ignominy, and <em>reiteracion</em>.
</p><p>
The trial court disregarded superiority because it "is inherent in the 
crime of rape or is absorbed in the element of force." It also did not 
consider nocturnity "there being no evidence that the accused purposely 
sought it to facilitate the commission of this rape." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 63.)
</p><p>
<em>Despoblado</em> was present according to the trial court because: 
"The accused dragged the offended party, at the point of a dagger, to 
the carabao trail, about 10 meters from the junction, but 40 to 50 
meters below to better attain his purpose without interference, and to 
better secure himself from detection and punishment (U.S. vs. Vitug, 17 
Phil. 1). Even the junction where the two children were left is already 
400 meters from the nearest house. While there maybe occasional 
passersby, this does not destroy its being an uninhabited place. (People
 vs. Bangug, 52 Phil. 87)." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 62.) We hold that the 
trial court for the reasons stated correctly held that the crime was 
committed in an uninhabited place.
</p><p>
The trial court held that there was ignominy because the appellant used 
not only the missionary position, i.e. male superior, female inferior, 
but also "The same position as dogs do" i.e., entry from behind. The 
appellant claims there was no ignominy because "The studies of many 
experts in the matter have shown that this 'position' is not novel and 
has repeatedly and often been resorted to by couples in the act of 
copulation." (Brief, p. 24.) This may well be if the sexual act is 
performed by consenting partners but not otherwise.
</p><p>
The trial court also held that "there is no <em>reiteracion</em> because
 one of the offenses, namely Robbery in Band, for which the accused has 
been penalized, was committed after the commission of this rape case, 
and the penalty imposed on the other offense of Frustrated Homicide, is 
lighter than the penalty for rape." (<em>Id.,</em> p. 63.)
</p><p>
Although not alleged in the complaint, the trial court stated that the 
offense was aggravated by disregard of rank because it was a fact known 
to the appellant that Mrs. Agno was a school teacher. The appellant 
claims that this circumstance cannot be assigned to him because there 
was no deliberate intent to offend or insult the rank of Mrs. Agno. The 
Solicitor General agrees with the appellant for the same reason.
</p><p>
The judgment of the trial court is in accordance with the facts and the 
law but it cannot be affirmed completely because of the lack of the 
necessary number of votes.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment under review is modified in the sense that the appellant shall suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> instead of death and the indemnity to be paid to the offended party is increased to P20,000.00. Costs against the appellant.
SO ORDERED.
