Textile Mills, <span class="SpellE">INc</span>. charged Sergio E. <span class="SpellE">Bagayba­gayan</span>, Deputy <span class="SpellE">Sheirff</span> in
the Court of First Instance of Manila, with irregular enforcement of a writ of
preli­minary attachment issued in Civil Case No. 132865 of the Court of First
Instance of Manila, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Filin­vest</span> Credit
Corp. vs. <span class="SpellE">Wearever</span> Textile Mills, Inc."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleged that the Deputy Sheriff, ac­companied by
armed companions, forcibly opened the gate of the factory compound of the
complainant by breaking and destroying the barrel bolts thereof; and that said
respondent Deputy Sheriff and his armed companions brought out and carted away
motor vehicles and office equipments which were inside the compound
notwithstanding the pre­vious understanding made between the complainant's offi­cials
and the respondent deputy sheriff that those arti­cles will be left in the
compound to be guarded by the sheriff's men.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment filed on October 24, 1980, the res­pondent deputy
sheriff specifically denied the allega­tions in the complaint and averred that
he implemented the writ of preliminary attachment in accordance with the Rules
of Court; that the complainant's officers be­came angry when the respondent
refused to suspend the enforcement of the writ while they were still contacting
<span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> officials and a general in Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>; and that there was no untoward incident whatsoever
in the enforcement of the writ of attachment.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The administrative matter was referred to Honorable Jose C. <span class="SpellE">Colayco</span>, Executive Judge of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, for investigation, report and recom­mendation in a second <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1980</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as found by investigating judge, are:</p>

<blockquote>"The salient fact that can be gleaned from the conflicting
evidence is that the respondent brought out the motor vehicles at 6:45 in the
afternoon with the assistance of men armed with long firearms after opening the
gate by force because of the refusal of the security guard to open the gate;
while the respondent claims that he was compelled to open the gate by force
because the complainant padlocked the gate to prevent him from carrying the
motor vehicles away at 3:50 in the same afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is need to examine the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bismala</span> signed his
report under oath and a copy of it was fur­nished to the <span class="SpellE">Taguig</span>
police within twenty-four (24) hours after the levy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had very little time to invent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His report gave the license-plate numbers of
the motor vehicles in which the PC constables arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent, on the other hand, waited for
more than seven (7) days before filing his return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 6, Rule 57 re­quires that the return be
filed immediately after the execution of the writ of attachment).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His version does not bear scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleges in his 'Comment' on the complaint
filed by the complainant with the Supreme Court that <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Billano</span> accused him falsely of employing force and
intimidation 'to cover up for his wrongdoings and to get even with me because I
did not succumb to his pressures and did not agree to his offer to bribe
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Colonel <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Billano</span> told respondent that <span class="SpellE">Billano</span>
is a P.C. Colonel and he knows the First Couple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Billano</span> told me
that I should not enforce the writ against complain­ant because certain highly
placed officials in the government are behind <span class="SpellE">Wearever</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Billano</span> even
offered to bribe me with the amount of P5,000.00, but I refused and I chastised
him, for which he got very embarrassed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told <span class="SpellE">Billano</span> that I am just performing my
duty as a sheriff upon court order and if he wishes to cancel the writ or
postpone enforcement, then he should go to the Court.' (pp. 7-8, record of Adm.
Matter).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was less explicit, however,
on the witness stand when he answered the question of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He testified that <span class="SpellE">Billano</span> ‘was trying to give
me some consideration in order that I will not implement’ the writ (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 24, <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1981</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he became
very vague about it under cross-examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you also mentioned
that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Billano</span> offered to give you a certain
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is that
consideration?</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘a:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I don’t know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said, can we not talk this over? Can we
not defer the implementation?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said,
well, sir, I have no discretion regarding the implementation of this writ of
attachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order emanated from the
court and I am just only bound to implement it.’ (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 94-95, <i style="">id)</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent alleges in his return, which he confirmed on
the witness stand, that a security guard of the complaint succeeded in
spiriting away two Crown Toyota cars by tricking him with a false phone
call.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to believe this because
the two <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> troopers assigned to assist him were
guarding the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Billano</span>
testified under cross-examination that after taking his lunch, the respondent
left and told him that he was going to take down the license-plate numbers of
the motor vehicles (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 102-103, <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="1">Jan. 22, 1981</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent testified that he had already
listed the motor vehicles when he was allegedly tricked (‘well, before pulling
out the units, I had already a prepared list of all the properties I was going
to pull out’ [<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. , p. 37, <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1981</st1:date>]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If he was telling the truth, his failure to mention in his return and in
his testimony the plate numbers of the vehicles allegedly taken away brands his
testimony as pure concoction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
testified that the security guards of the complainant threatened him and his
companion with bodily harm, and that one of them was arrested by the <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> troopers for concealing a bladed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is also not credible, because he
testified during his direct examination that there was no untoward or violent
incident, not even any heated argument, before he ordered the opening of the
gate (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 54-55, <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1981</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Metrocom</span> troopers also contradicted him
because they testified that they did not notice any commotion or fight during
the entire period that they were inside the compound. (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
pp. 13-14, <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1981</st1:date>;
9-10, <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1981</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the foregoing evaluation, it is believed that
the respondent agreed for a time not to move the motor vehicles until the
following morning upon the request of <span class="SpellE">Billano</span>, but <span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> prevailed upon him to transfer them and furnished
the armed PC troopers to assist him, in anticipation of the resistance by the
security guards of the complainant; and that the respondent ordered the
forcible opening of the gate when the security guards refused to open it."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the investigating judge are supported by the
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the facts found by the investigating judge, it is clear that
the respondent deputy sheriff abused his authority when he employed armed men
to assist him and forced the gate open without a court order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actuation of the deputy sheriff was
aggravated by the fact that the armed men, although presumably members of the
Philippine Constabulary, were not in uniform and were obviously employed to
intimidate the security guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recommendation of the investigating judge that the respondent
deputy sheriff be ordered to pay a fine equivalent to his salary for one (1)
month is reasonable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the respondent, Deputy Sheriff Sergio E. <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span>, is hereby found guilty of irregular en­forcement
of the writ of preliminary attachment issued in Civil Case No. 132865 of the
Court of First Instance of Manila and is hereby ordered to pay a fine
equivalent to his salary for one (1) month, with the warning that a repetition
of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.</p>
