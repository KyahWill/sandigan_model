decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals) dated
October 28, 1983 and its resolution dated December 29, 1983 in AC-G.R. CV No.
58626-27 entitled, “Filipinas Investment and Finance Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> Cuevas.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts in the instant case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1963" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> Cuevas purchased from Ace
Consolidated Inc. one unit Nissan truck and executed a promissory note in favor
of the corporation for the balance of the installment price in the amount of
P38<span class="GramE">,135.26</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
secure the payment of said promissory note, respondent Cuevas executed a
chattel mortgage on the said Nissan truck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1963</st1:date>,
respondent Cuevas purchased from the Ace Consolidated, Inc. one unit <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird car and executed a promissory note for P12<span class="GramE">,540.00</span>, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>the
balance of the purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>the payment of <span class="GramE">said</span> amount, a chattel mortgage was executed by respondent
Cuevas on the <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1963" day="9" month="12">December
 9, 1963</st1:date>, Cuevas again purchased from Ace Consolidated, Inc. one
unit <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird car, and executed a promissory
note for P12<span class="GramE">,540.00</span>, which is the balance of the
purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">To </span>secure the payment thereof, Cuevas executed a chattel
mortgage on the said <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of these promissory notes contains a
stipulation that upon failure of the debtor to pay any of the monthly
installments, the whole sum remaining unpaid will immediately become due and
payable at the option of the holder of the note (pp. 8­-18, Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This stipulation is likewise provided in the
contracts of chattel mortgage with the condition that the mortgages may be
foreclosed by the mortgagee upon failure to pay any of the installments.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of these promissory notes and chattel mortgages were subsequently
assigned by Ace Consolidated, Incorporated to Filipinas Investment and Finance
Corporation, petitioner herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1965, Cuevas filed a complaint with preliminary
injunction with the then Court of First Instance of Manila docketed as Civil
Case No. 61514 to enjoin the petitioner corporation from foreclosing the
chattel mortgage on the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> cars purchased on
installment by the respondent from Ace Consolidated, Inc., petitioner's
predecessor-in-interest, and to declare the assignment made by Ace
Consolidated, Inc., to Filipinas Investment and Finance Corporation null and
void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner corporation filed a
counterclaim seeking the possession of the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span>
cars for the purpose of extrajudicial foreclosure of the chattel mortgage or,
in the alternative, the payment of the unpaid installments and the remaining
balance on the promissory notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> filed
a complaint with the same court docketed as Civil Case No. 61651 seeking to
recover from Cuevas the sum of unpaid installments on one Nissan truck
purchased by the latter from Ace Consolidated on installment basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Cases Nos. 61514 and 61651 were consolidated and jointly
tried in the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="GramE">corporation</span> applied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for
</span>the seizure of the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird cars
from respondent Cuevas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
granted the application and the two cars were seized by the sheriff from
private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Cuevas
filed a motion for the return of the said vehicles, and for this purpose, he
gave a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
approved the bond and the vehicles were returned to respondent Cuevas on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the trial, the Court rendered a
judgment on <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1966</st1:date>,
which was modified in an order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the amended decision is quoted as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, in Civil Case No. 61514, judgment

this Court and declaring the Filipinas Investment and Finance Corporation

Cuevas and/or to execute </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the judgment for value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to petitioner's suggestions, the deputy
sheriff made a supplemental return to the writ of execution stating that the
petitioner corporation accepted the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> cars
not as a satisfaction of the writ, but to levy the same on execution under the
writ of execution in Civil Case No. 61651 of the CFI of Manila and/or to
execute on the judgment for value in view of the alleged depreciation of the
said cars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Cuevas and Citadel
Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. filed an urgent motion to declare the judgment
satisfied and to recall the </span>writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the parties were given sufficient
opportunity to make several motions, oppositions and memoranda, the trial court
issued orders declaring the judgment already satisfied and directing the clerk
of court to return the amount deposited by Cuevas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This caused the filing of a motion for
reconsideration by petitioner and opposition and the filing of memoranda by the
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1970</st1:date>, the court set aside its order
declaring the judgment satisfied and directed the reception of the evidence
concerning the value of the <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> cars.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 25, 1970, the trial court denied the motion of petitioner
corporation and ruled that the petitioner corporation had not filed any
application for damages while the case was pending before the trial court or
before appeal by respondent Cuevas <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>perfected,
or before the judgment of the trial court had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; that since the judgment of the court had long
become final, the claim of petitioner corporation against the bond of Citadel
Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. can no longer be entertained, as the court had
already lost its jurisdiction to amend the decision in the case to include the
award of damages against the re-delivery bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court stated that although <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> had alleged proofs to show the substantial deterioration of
the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> cars in support of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its claim </span>for the execution of the
judgment for value, these proofs had already been presented and made known to
the court before the latter issued its orders on <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1970</st1:date> declaring the judgment satisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the court also declared that
petitioner corporation had abandoned and waived its right to present more
concrete and acceptable evidence concerning the value of the two <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> cars, when it failed to comply with the order of the
court on <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1970</st1:date>
directing the introduction of such evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court finally concluded that the total evidence on record was
not sufficient to prove the assertion of <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> that the two cars had substantially deteriorated, and that
the judgment had in fact already been satisfied (pp. 85-103, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1971, petitioner corporation filed Civil Case No.
83110 against respondent Cuevas based on two causes of action, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>firstly, to recover the unpaid sum of
P12,450.92 plus interest, on the promissory note for P38,135.36 made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>November 21, 1963 by respondent
Cuevas in favor of Ace Consolidated, Inc.; and secondly, to collect the
remaining sum of P12,254.45 on the promissory note for P12,540.00 made on
December 9, 1963, in favor of Ace Consolidated, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1971</st1:date>, petitioner filed
a motion for the dismissal of the first cause of action in its complaint, which
motion was granted by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="9">September 27,
 1971</st1:date>, petitioner filed another complaint docketed as Civil Case No.
84625, to collect the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,450.92</span> with
interest, based on the promissory note executed on <st1:date year="1963" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1963</st1:date>, in favor of Ace Consolidated,
Incorporated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Answering the complaints in Civil Cases Nos. 83110 and 84625,
respondent Cuevas admitted the genuineness and due execution of the two
promissory notes, but asserted as affirmative defenses, that the said
promissory notes had already been litigated in Civil Cases Nos. 61514 and
61651; that the decision rendered therein had become final and had already been
executed, so that the present suits are now barred on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
and/or, that the obligations of the respondent under the two promissory notes
had long been extinguished by payment or satisfaction of prior judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1971</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order for consolidation of cases nos. 83110 and 84625
upon motion of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
consolidation and trial on the merits of both cases, the trial court rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1975</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

</span>Records disclose that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">controversy

sale, in favor of Ace Consolidated, Inc. petitioner's predecessor in interest; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">2) </span>another promissory note dated

Bluebird car subject of the sale; and 3) another promissory note dated November
9, 1963, executed by respondent Cuevas in favor of Ace Consolidated, Inc.,
petitioner's predecessor in interest, in the amount of P12,540.00 secured by a
chattel mortgage over another <span class="SpellE">Datsun</span> Bluebird car

</span>Further, <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> instituted
Civil Case No. 61651 to collect the unpaid installment price on the Nissan

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further submits that there is no substantial
distinction between a new action for a sum of money and an action for revival
of judgment; that instead of filing an action for revival of the previous
judgment in Case No. 61514, it had chosen to file new suits for sum of money
based on this same promissory notes dated November 22, 1963 and December 9,
1963, because the five-year period from the finality of the judgment in Case
No. 61514 had already elapsed, without the said judgment having been satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The foregoing contentions
