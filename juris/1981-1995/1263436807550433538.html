offended party in this case, the sum of P15,000.00 as actual damages plus
interest thereon at the legal rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of
the Information on February 22, 1988.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, sometime in October 1987,
accused-appellant Elena Verano y Abanes persuaded the three (3) private
complainants, Jose Daep, Arturo Espiel and Alfonso Abanes to accept overseas
employment as salesmen in Bahrain.  In
consideration thereof, Alfonso, Arturo and Jose were required to pay P10,000.00
each to cover the expenses for the processing of their travel papers, i.e.,
passports, visas and the cost of their plane tickets, medical examination and
recruitment fees.  Jose paid the total
amount of P15,000.00 while Arturo and Alfonso paid P10,000.00 and P7,150.00,
respectively.  They were issued separate
receipts by accused-appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> To
further convince them of her capacity to send them abroad, accused-appellant
even signed a contract of employment with her as employer and Arturo as
employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Assured that they could depart for Bahrain on 27 December 1987,
Alfonso, Jose and Arturo went to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and
waited for accused-appellant who was supposed to meet them there to deliver
their passports, visas and plane tickets.  When she failed to show up, the three (3) recruits proceeded to her
residence and there waited for her until she returned four (4) days later.  By way of explanation, they were told that
their passports and visas were still being processed but were promised they
could leave for their overseas jobs on 15 January 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the three (3) hopefuls proceeded to the NAIA but, like
before, accused-appellant failed to show up.  This time they were told that they could definitely leave on 13 February
1988.  However, on the appointed date
and time, accused-appellant failed to show up for the third time.  Jose, Arturo and Alfonso then went to the
Western Police District Headquarters to lodge their complaint.  Accused-appellant was arrested on the same
day and charged with illegal recruitment committed in large scale, and estafa,
with Jose Daep as the lone complainant in the latter case.  After trial, Elena Verano y Abanes was found
guilty in both cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Brief filed by the Public Attorney's Office,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
accused-appellant contends that the trial court gravely erred when it imposed
the penalty of life imprisonment for the large scale illegal recruitment for
the reason that it was too harsh in the light of her good faith in just wanting
to help the private complainants secure employment abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in her Supplemental Brief and Reply<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> filed
by her counsel <i>de </i><i><span style="">parte</span></i><span style="">, </span>Atty. Mariano R. de Joya, Jr.,
accused-appellant changed her position.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead of pursuing her attack on the "harshness" of the penalty
imposed, she now disputes the findings of fact.  Thus she argues that, contrary to the trial court's findings, she
never represented herself as having the capacity to contract workers for
overseas employment; that she merely introduced private complainants Jose,
Arturo and Alfonso to a certain Juliet Majestrado who was the one who claimed
to have such capacity; and, with respect to her conviction for estafa, she
argues that although she herself issued the receipts marked Exhs.
"C," "E," "EÂ­-1," "E-2" and
"H," she never profited from the money paid as it was all given to
and personally received by Juliet Majestrado.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's argument is obviously without merit in the light of
the well-settled doctrine that findings of fact made by the trial court are
final and conclusive and cannot be reviewed on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Except for a few recognized instances,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which do not apply in the case at bench, such findings are binding and will not
be reviewed by us for this Court is not a trier of facts.  The issues raised by appellant are purely
and undisputably factual, as she herself admits.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering that none of the exceptions apply, as aforesaid, we would not be
justified in reversing the judgment of conviction.  Hence, the appeal must fail.</p>
