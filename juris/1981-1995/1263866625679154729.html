</span>Case AC No. 025, lifting the writ of preliminary injunction previously

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="3">26 March 1979</st1:date>,
petitioners filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a petition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for nullification of transfer of shares and of directors’ election, with prayer
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, docketed therein as SEC
Case No. 1719.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition alleged <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that sometime in November 1976, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Nordy</span>
Diploma endorsed WOODWORKS, INC. stock certificate Nos. 151 (229 shares), 152
(281 shares), 154 (75 shares), 155 (150 shares), 156 (270 shares) and 157 (150
shares), covering a total of 1,155 shares, and deposited these certificates in
Safety Deposit Box No. 243 maintained jointly under his name and that of
private respondent Ezekiel P. <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> at the Associated
Citizens Bank branch on T.M. <span class="SpellE">Kalaw</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, Manila.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition further alleged that petitioner Diploma entrusted
the duplicate key to the deposit box to respondent <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>
-- his close business associate, friend, confidant and client for ten (10)
solid years since 1968 -- with the instruction for <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>
to have access to his box should anything happen to him, since he (Diploma) was
frequently traveling here and abroad; that sometime in November 1978,
petitioner Diploma discovered, soon after he returned from a 2-month sojourn
abroad, that the stock certificates were in <span class="SpellE">Toeg's</span>
possession and upon inquiry with the depository bank, petitioner Diploma
learned that on 16 August 1978, <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> opened the
safety deposit box; that upon learning of <span class="SpellE">Toeg's</span>
faithless act of opening the safety deposit box and stealing Diploma's share
certificates therein, which were endorsed in blank, Diploma confronted, and <span class="SpellE">Iater</span> negotiated with <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> and
some of the other respondents, who were either <span class="SpellE">Toeg's</span>
transferees or nominees, but to no avail; that on 13 February 1979, Diploma
charged <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> with theft in the Office of the City
Fiscal of Manila, docketed therein as I.S. No. 79-2740; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>his counter affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> took the position that Diploma had sold his 1,155
shares way back in February 1978 to <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>, Jacob
(James) Isaac and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bundang</span>;
that sometime in the early part of February 1979, they (petitioners) received a
secretary's certificate issued by respondent <span class="SpellE">Emigdio</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Tanjuatco</span>, Jr., certifying to the election of
directors<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

January 1979 was absolutely illegal, null and void for absence of notice to
stockholders of record, especially to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 March 1979, SEC Hearing Officer, Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span> issued a restraining order<a style="mso-footnote-id:

are not entitled thereto; further, respondents are hereby enjoined from voting
the contested shares in the annual stockholders' meeting of the corporation and

petitioners have established that respondent <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>
'acquired’ the 1,155 shares not through a sale made to him by petitioner
Diploma or by any legitimate transfer of ownership thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, petitioners have
demonstrated that respondent <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> stole the aforesaid
shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The verdict of the City Fiscal
of Manila rendered in the criminal case (I.S. No. 79-4740) filed by petitioner

and Jacob (James) Isaac, involving the same shares in controversy, ascribed to
the existence of a prima facie case of theft against said respondents and, as a
result of which, an information, docketed as Criminal Case No. 46459, was filed
before the Court of First Instance of Manila (See petitioners' Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Manifestation).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the City Fiscal of Manila believed that there exist a
prima facie case of theft precludes any stigma of doubt as to the right of
petitioners to the injunctive relief."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="8">20 August 1979</st1:date>,
private respondents appealed the order of the Hearing Officer dated <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="5">31 May 1979</st1:date> to the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 September 1979, while their appeal was pending with the SEC

<i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, with prayer for the issuance of a
restraining order, to annul and set aside the orders of the Hearing Officer
dated 31 May 1979 and 23 July 1979 and to enjoin the therein respondents (now
petitioners) from continuing with the proceedings in SEC Case No. 1719,
docketed herein as G.R. No. 51435.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="11">9 November 1979</st1:date>, the Court dismissed
the petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the private respondents filed with the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
a Manifestation and Motion<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

dated <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="3">19 March 1980</st1:date> of the
Minister of Justice, then Hon. Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, which
reversed the findings of the City Fiscal of Manila in I.S. No. 79-4740,
entitled "Diploma vs. <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>, et al." and
directed the fiscal to move for the dismissal of the criminal case for theft
against therein respondents (also herein respondents) for lack of <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents prayed
that the incident pending before the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> be
resolved immediately with the lifting of the preliminary injunction earlier
issued by the Hearing Officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the petitioners had filed their comment<a style="mso-footnote-id:

on the aforesaid manifestation and motion, the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> issued
on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">21 April 1980</st1:date> an order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the pertinent and <span class="SpellE">dispositve</span> portion of which reads
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Reading the appealed Order, the decisive factor in the
issuance of the writ of injunction apparently was the resolution of the City
Fiscal<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>of Manila in I.S. No. 79-4740
finding <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case of theft against respondents therein,
the same herein appellants Ezekiel F. <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bundang</span> and Jacob (James)
Isaac.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This finding, however, was lately
reversed by the Minister of Justice in his letter-directive to the City Fiscal
of Manila (See Annex 1, appellants' Manifestation and Motion). This being the
case, the appealed Order should be reversed, the very foundation upon which the
writ of preliminary injunction was issued had ceased to exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed Order is hereby reversed and,
accordingly, the writ of preliminary injunction is hereby lifted and
dissolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents-appellants may
now proceed to perform their functions as officers elected on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1979</st1:date> elections.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let the records of the case be remanded to the Hearing
Officer for trial on the merits.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioners interposed the present petition, claiming that
respondent SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> acted without jurisdiction and with grave
abuse of discretion in issuing the questioned order (21 April 1980), and that
there is no appeal nor any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law other than this present petition.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the SEC acted without jurisdiction and
with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the questioned order because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) it reversed a previous ruling of this
Court in G.R. No. L-51435, and violated the law of the case which had already
been established; (b) it effectively transferred more than 40% ownership of a
corporation engaged in exploiting Philippine natural resources from a Filipino
to a disqualified alien; (c) it effectively pre-judged the case on the merits,
disturbed the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> and placed private respondents in an
undue advantage over the petitioners; (d) it was based on evidence not adduced
before the SEC but on evidence adduced before the Manila City Fiscal and on
considerations of proof appropriate for a criminal case and not for an
administrative litigation; and (e) it legitimized a special stockholders'
meeting for the election of corporate directors despite the absence of notice
to all stockholders as required by the corporate by-laws.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' contention that the dismissal by this Court of
the private respondents' earlier petition for <i>certiorari</i> in G.R. No. 51435
questioning the orders of the SEC hearing officer in SEC Case No. 1719, dated
31 May 1979 and 23 July 1979, constitutes the "law of the case" which
precluded the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> from ruling again on the same issue of
whether petitioners were entitled to a writ of preliminary injunction, is
untenable.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">“’Law of the case' has been defined as the opinion delivered on a
former appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More specifically, it
means that whatever is once irrevocably established, as the controlling legal
rule or decision between the same parties in the same case continues to be the
law of the case, whether correct on general principles or not, so long as the
facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be facts of the case
before the court.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">In this </span>connection,
it is well to recall that in G.R. No. 51435, the petitioners therein, who are
now the private respondents in this case, contended that the SEC, thru its
hearing officer, acted without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in
issuing the disputed orders on the ground that the petition in SEC Case No.
1719, although denominated as a Petition for Nullification of Transfer of
Shares and of Directors' Election was in reality an action for <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> which is not cognizable by the Supreme
Court or by the Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court, however, simply dismissed the
petition for lack of merit in a minute resolution of <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="11">9 November 1979</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">without </span>explaining the reasons on which it was predicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may
be </span>stated that in dismissing the petition, the Court merely resolved the
point in issue, i.e., the regularity of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the
</span>issuance of the questioned orders and held that the same were issued
with jurisdiction and without grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be emphasized however that the
Court in dismissing the petition did <u>not</u> make any ruling <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>merits</u> of the petition as to establish a controlling legal rule which
had to be subsequently followed by the parties in the same case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, no "law of the case" may be
said to have been laid down in G.R. No. 51432.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Jarantilla</u></span><u> vs. Court of
Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the facts were as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner therein Edgar <span class="SpellE">Jarantilla</span> was charged
before the City Court of Iloilo for serious physical injuries thru reckless
imprudence in Criminal Case No. 47207.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was acquitted in said criminal case "on reasonable
doubt".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the therein
private respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Kuan</span> Sing filed a separate
civil action for damages against the petitioner with the Court of First Instance
of Iloilo, Branch IV, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 9976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting upon the petitioner's motion to
dismiss, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> denied the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, petitioner filed in this Court a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>, assailing the
trial court's order denying his motion to dismiss, docketed herein as G.R. No.
40992.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court dismissed the petition
for lack of merit in a resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="7">23
 July 1975</st1:date>, and denied the motion for reconsideration for the same
reason in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="10">28
 October 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court below rendered judgment in favor of the
private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Court
of Appeals affirmed the decision of the lower court except as to the award of
moral damages which it reduced from P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to
P18,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration
was denied by the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, petitioner filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with
this Court docketed herein as G.R. No. 80194.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raised a collateral issue by faulting the respondent Court
of Appeals for refusing to resolve an assignment of error in his appeal
therein, said respondent court holding that the main issue had been passed upon
by this Court in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-40992.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was petitioner's position that the
aforementioned two (2) resolutions of the Court in said case, the first
dismissing the petition and the second denying the motion for reconsideration,
did not constitute the "law of the case" which would control the
subsequent proceedings in the controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>resolving</u> this collateral issue, this Court held:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The 'doctrine of the law of the case' has no application at
the aforesaid posture of the proceedings when the two resolutions were handed
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it may be true that G.R. No.
L-40992 may have involved some of the issues which were thereafter submitted
for resolution on the merits by the two lower courts, the proceedings involved
there was for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> assailing an
interlocutory order of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, specifically, its order
denying therein defendant's motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This court, without rendering a specific opinion or explanation as to
the legal and factual bases on which its two resolutions were predicated,
simply dismissed the special civil action for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may very well be that such resolution was
premised on the fact that the Court, at that stage and on the basis of the
facts then presented, did not consider that the denial order of the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, no rationale for such resolutions
having been expounded on the merits of that action, no law of the case may be
said to have been laid down in G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-40992 to justify
the respondent court's refusal to consider petitioner's claim that his former
acquittal barred the separate action."</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The herein petitioners also contend that the issuance of the
questioned SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution constitutes a pre-judgment of

<p class="BODY">The issuance of the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> questioned order

In issuing the writ of preliminary injunction, the Hearing Officer in SEC Case
No. 1719 did not maintain the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> but restored the corpo­rate
situation preceding the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>, i.e., the corporate situation
before the stockholders' meeting held on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="1">22 January 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lifting by the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> of the writ of preliminary
