				<BR><STRONG>MEDIALDEA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court seeking the annulment of the order of the respondent Deputy
Minister of Labor dated June 19, 1979 in Case No. R04-11-10474-77-T, entitled
"EDMUND YAP, Complainant, versus ASSOCIATED CITIZENS BANK, Respondent,"
which upheld <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>termination of
employment of petitioner and ordered the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">payment
of separation </span>pay to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Edmund Yap was employed by respondent bank from <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1967</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1977</st1:date> as Assistant Vice-President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned as branch <span class="GramE">manager</span>
of the <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> branch of the former Associated Banking
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="1">January
 13, 1977</st1:date> signed by respondent's Executive Vice-President,
petitioner was informed that his employment as Assistant Vice-President had
been terminated effective <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1976</st1:date> on the ground that he was not elected by the Board of
Directors to his position as Assistant Vice-President and for other reasons
including redundancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Executive
Vice-President also expressed in behalf of the bank his sincere appreciation
for petitioner's stay with the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> termination letter reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>”<st1:date year="1977" day="13" month="1">13
 January 1977</st1:date></blockquote>

Vice-President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this, and other

Executive Vice-President"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The effective date of termination of petitioner's employment<b> </b>was
later moved to <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the
Department of Labor against respondent bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case was set for hearing and notice thereof was served on the
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1977</st1:date>, petitioner
submitted his position paper in support of his complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondent bank filed its
position paper on <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1978</st1:date>,
the Regional Director issued an Order, which stated in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Incident to the merging of Associated Banking Corporation and
Citizens Bank and Trust Company a resolution was adopted by the Board of
Directors declaring all corporate position(s) to be vacant including the
position held by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> Yap, as Assistant
Vice-President of the Associated Citizens Bank.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant is a managerial employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As (such) he can be
dismissed even without a prior clearance from this Office.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">we </span>find that sufficient grounds exist to warrant the dismissal of
complainant.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this case is hereby dismissed for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED" (p. 26, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the aforementioned order, petitioner <st1:place>Yap</st1:place>
appealed to the Secretary of Labor alleging that the dismissal was without just
cause and praying that he be reinstated without loss of seniority rights, and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the time of dismissal up to reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On June 19, 1979, the
then Deputy Minister of Labor, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, issued an order which partially reversed the
appealed order of the Regional Director and which stated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It is apparent that one of the reasons or causes for terminating
the services of complainant was due to redundancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, complainant is entitled
to termination pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section 9 (a),
Rule I, Book VI of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code
provides that a regular employee shall be entitled to termination pay
equivalent to at least one month salary or to one month salary for every year
of service, whichever is higher, a fraction of at least six (6) months being
considered as one whole year in case of termination of his employment due to
the installation of labor-saving device or redundancy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the whole, we find for the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant having served for ten (10) years
at the rate of P1<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>, he is entitled P14,000.00 as
separation pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed Order is hereby set aside, and new
judgment is entered, ordering respondent to pay complainant P14<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as separation pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 36-37, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>issues
to be resolved in the instant case are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>1) whether or not the dismissal of petitioner was for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a j</span>ust and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">valid </span>cause; and 2) whether or not petitioner was deprived of
his constitutional right to due process in the proceedings before the Regional
office of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first issue, petitioner submits that he had been
illegally dismissed by respondent bank; that the ground of redundancy for which
he was dismissed was false because respondent Bank immediately created (3) new
positions of assistant vice-president after petitioner's dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also alleges that he was dismissed
retroactively, without prior notice or hearing and without the required
clearance from the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The free will of management to conduct its own business affairs
to achieve its purpose cannot be denied (Abbot Laboratories v. NLRC, G.R. No.
76959, October 12, 1987, 154 SCRA 713).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even as the law is solicitous of the welfare of employees, it must also
protect the right of an employer to exercise what are clearly management
prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, management is not
precluded from undertaking <span class="GramE">a reorganization</span> within the
company or entering into mergers with other companies to meet the demands of
the enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such cases, the
company has the prerogative to abolish managerial and confidential positions or
create new ones as the necessity for them requires.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <st1:place>Yap</st1:place> is the Assistant
Vice-President of respondent bank and at the same time the Branch Manager of
the bank's <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt that he is a managerial
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records show that Associated
Banking Corporation entered into a merger with Citizens Bank and Trust Company,
which resulted in the creation of respondent Associated Citizens Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the Board of Directors
adopted a resolution declaring all corporate positions vacant including the
position held by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
latter was not subsequently re-appointed by the Board of Directors to the same
position of Assistant Vice-President, he was notified by the bank that his
services are terminated on grounds of non-reelection and redundancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whatever was the reason behind petitioner's
non-reelection by the Board of Directors is beyond the interference of this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is worthy to mention however,
that petitioner had been previously found guilty by the bank for extending an
overdraft without an authority in the amount of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to a certain <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> King, an act constituting breach of
trust imposed upon him by the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although he was merely suspended <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for
</span>such act, management has the prerogative now not to re-appoint him to
its new set of officers in view of the changes being undertaken by the bank
pursuant to the merger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To choose who to
appoint or re-appoint as its<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> officers </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">managers is part of the bank's inherent right </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">control and manage effectively its operations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>
v.</span> People's Bank and Trust Company, No. L-43835, <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1981</st1:date>, 103 SCRA 599, which substantially
contains similar set of facts, <span class="GramE">We</span> held:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> was not employed for a fixed
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He held his position of
department manager at the pleasure of the bank's board of directors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He occupied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>managerial position and his stay therein depended on his
retention of the trust and confidence of the management and whether there was
any need for his services.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although some vindictive motivation might have impelled the
abolition of his position, yet it is undeniable that the bank's board of
directors possessed the power to remove him and to determine whether the
interest of the bank justified the existence of his department.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As already noted above, the facts of this case do not warrant
the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Bondoc's</span> right to security of
tenure was <span class="SpellE">oppresively</span> abridged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew all along that his tenure as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a</span> department manager rested in the
discretion of the bank's board of directors and that at anytime his services
might be dispensed with or his position might be abolished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention concerning the alleged retroactive
termination of his employment is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the termination letter stated <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1976</st1:date> as the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the termination of his employment, petitioner was actually dismissed on <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1977</st1:date> as found by public
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the clearance requirement imposed by the
Termination Pay Law, a law earlier in force, it is correct to reiterate
established rulings that as part of the procedural due process, a clearance
required under the old law for the dismissal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of an employee should be obtained </span>prior to the operative act of
termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">this </span>rule was not without
exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One exception is set forth
in Policy Instructions No. 8 issued by the then Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy dispenses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">with </span>the clearance requirement in cases where managerial
employees are to be dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Policy
instructions No. 8, in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>part,
reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The employer is not required to obtain a previous written clearance
to terminate managerial employees in order to enable him to manage
effectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, managerial employees may also not be
terminated without just cause although there are causes valid for terminating
managerial employees other than those applicable to the rank-and-file.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For instance, elective company officials may
lose their jobs as president, executive vice-president or vice-president, etc.
because the stockholders or the board of directors, for one reason or another
did not reelect them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>General <span class="GramE">managers</span>, department managers, etc. whose powers and
functions are central to the effective operation of the company may be
terminated for lack of confidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This policy is essential to the effective pursuit of
enterprise to effective management."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>findings
of facts of the Deputy Minister of Labor on the propriety of the dismissal of
petitioner are binding upon this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Findings of administrative agencies which have acquired expertise
because their jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally
accorded not only respect but even finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Judicial review by the Supreme Court on labor cases does not go so far
as to evaluate the sufficiency of the evidence upon which the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>proper labor officer or office based
his or its determination but are limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave
abuse of discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(Special </span>Events

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, petitioner submits that he was deprived
of his right to due process during the proceedings before the Regional Director
when the latter failed to conduct an actual hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also contends that the position papers
submitted by the parties to the Regional Director were not sufficient bases for
the latter's findings that the dismissal of petitioner was valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above contentions of petitioner must fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records show that petitioner was accorded
ample opportunity to fully present his side of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, petitioner filed his position
paper while respondent filed its own later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the order of the Regional Director was appealed, petitioner filed
his memorandum on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he had
sufficient opportunity to inform the labor officers concerned of his side of
the controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that there is no denial of due process where
although the labor officer or tribunal dispensed with the actual hearing or
trial on the merits, the parties were heard through their position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The procedure by which issues are resolved
based on position papers, affidavits and other documentary evidence is
recognized as not <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of procedural due process
(B. Sta. Rita &amp; Company, Inc. v. Arroyo and NLRC, G.R. No. 80452, December
20, 1988, 168 SCRA 581).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is based
on the principle that technical rules of evidence are not binding in labor
cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the law presumes
regularity in the performance of labor officials’ functions in issuing the
orders.</p>
