<p class="BODY">After this, the co-owners signed a partition agreement,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

exclusive ownership and possession of their respective individual shares in
accordance with the subdivision plan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The former co-owners evidently overlooked the fact that, by
reason of the subdivision, Lot 860-B of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Dila</span> came to include the entire frontage of what used to be
Lot 860 along <span class="SpellE">Parada</span> Road, and thus effectively
isolated from said road the other lots, i.e., Lots 860-A and 860-C of Cornelia <span class="SpellE">Dila</span>, and Lot 860-D of the children of <span class="SpellE">Anacleta</span>
Dila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Anyway, Cornelia sold <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 860-A (2,204 sq.

1971, the <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Sisters sold the land to <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> J.

<p class="BODY">Some months later, in March, 1972, after having set up a piggery
on his newly acquired property, Ramos had his lawyer write to <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> Francisco -- ­owner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as above mentioned, of the adjoining lot, Lot 266 -- to ask for a right
of way through the latter's land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Negotiations thereafter had however failed to bring about a satisfactory
arrangement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Francisco's proposal for an
exchange of land at the rate of one (1) square meter from him to three (3)
square meters from Ramos, as was supposedly the custom in the locality, was
unacceptable to Ramos.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">5</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Later that year, 1972, Ramos succeeded, through the intercession
of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Tongco</span> of Valenzuela, in obtaining a three-meter
wide passageway through <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 860-B of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span>
Dila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ten-foot high concrete wall on his lot, this was in August, 1973, and thereby
closed the very right of way granted to him across Lot 860-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems that what he wished was to have a
right of passage precisely through Francisco's land, considering this to be
more convenient to him, and he did not bother to keep quiet about his
determination to bring suit, if necessary, to get what he wanted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Francisco learned of Ramos' intention and reacted by replacing
the barbed-wire fence on his lot along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Parada</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> with a stone wall,
also in August, 1973.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">8</span></span></a> Shortly
thereafter, Francisco was served with summons and a copy of the complaint in
Civil Case No. 66-V-73 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
instituted by Ramos,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">9</span></span></a> as well
as a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction directing him to remove his stone

<p class="BODY">Francisco moved to dissolve the mandatory injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court appointed a commissioner who
conducted an ocular inspection of the lots in question, Lots 860-A, 860-B and
266 and submitted a report of his findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of the commissioner's report, the Court issued another

<p class="BODY">What clearly the appealed Decision overlooked or failed to accord
the significance due it is the fact already adverted to and which has never
been disputed that respondent Ramos, having already been granted access to the
public road (<span class="SpellE">Parada</span> Road) through the other adjoining
Lot 860-B owned by <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Dila</span>
-- and this; at the time he was negotiating with petitioner for the similar
easement over the latter's Lot 266 that he now claims -- inexplicably gave up
that right of access by walling off his property from the passageway thus
established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, also <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>, is that said passageway was 2.76 meters
wide, or wide enough to accommodate a truck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The surveyor who at the instance of petitioner made a survey of the
premises on September 13, 1973, shortly after Ramos had filed his complaint,
verified the existence of said passageway from the presence of tire marks found
on the scene and indicated on the sketch plan he prepared the path that it took
from said respondent's Lot 860-A through Lot 860-B to <span class="SpellE">Parada</span>
Road.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">4</span></span></a> That there was such a passageway was also confirmed
by another witness, <span class="SpellE">Parada</span> Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> Francisco, one of those who had earlier tried to
bring petitioner and respondent to an agreement about the proposed right of way
through the property of the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
witness declared, as already stated, that after the negotiations had been
stalled by the failure of the parties to agree on the terms of a proposed land
exchange that would have given Ramos access to <span class="SpellE">Parada</span>
Road, said respondent had been able to obtain right of passage to the same
public road over a 3-meter wide portion of Lot 860-B owned by <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Dila</span> through the
intercession of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Tongco</span> of Valenzuela.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">1</span></span></a> The presence of the tire marks indicating that the
portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 860-B where they were found had been used
as a passageway was also brought to the attention of the Trial Court at the
ocular inspection conducted, with the parties present or duly represented, on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1974</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The evidence is,
therefore, persuasively to the effect that the private respondent had been
granted an adequate access to the public highway (</span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Parada</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">) through the adjacent estate of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span> <span class="SpellE">Dila</span> even as he was
trying to negotiate a satisfactory agreement with petitioner Francisco for
another passageway through the latter's property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If at the time he filed suit against the
petitioner, such access (through the property of <span class="SpellE">Epifania</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dila</span>) could no longer be used, it was because he
himself had closed it off by erecting a stone wall on his lot at the point
where the passageway began for no reason to which the record can attest except
to demonstrate the isolation of his property alleged in his complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the law makes it amply clear that an
owner cannot, as respondent has done, by his own act isolate his property from
a public highway and then claim an easement of way through an adjacent
estate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third of the cited
requisites:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the claimant of a right

thereby vitiated his claim to such an easement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It will not do to assert that use of the passageway through Lot 860-B
was difficult or inconvenient, the evidence being to the contrary and that it
was wide enough to be traversable by even a truck, and also because it has been
held that mere inconvenience attending the use of an existing right of way does
not justify a claim for a similar easement in an alternative location.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>" * * the petitioner contends that since the respondent
company constructed the concrete wall blocking his ingress and egress via the <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> Avenue, the nearest, most convenient and
adequate road to and from a public highway, he has been constrained to use as
his 'temporary' way the adjoining lots belonging to different persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said way is allegedly 'bumpy and impassable
especially during rainy seasons because of flood waters, mud and tall '<span class="SpellE">talahib</span>' grasses thereon.' Moreover, according to the
petitioner, the road right of way which the private respondents referred to as
the petitioner's alternative right of way to <span class="SpellE">Sucat</span>
Road is not an existing road but has remained a proposed road as indicated in
the subdivision plan of the <span class="SpellE">Sobrina</span> Rodriguez <span class="SpellE">Lombos</span> Subdivision.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

Subdivision indicated as Lot 4133-G-12 in its subdivision plan for the buyers
of its lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that said lot is
still undeveloped and causes inconvenience to the petitioner when he uses it to
reach the public highway does not bring him within the ambit of the legal

maintained through the years regarding an easement of a right of way, that
