Petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>of the decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  of the respondent Court of Appeals (now the Intermediate Appellate 
Court) issued on March 22, 1982 in CA-G. R. No. SP-12923 entitled "Bruno
 Bumanglag, et al., petitioners, versus Hon. Hermenegildo A. Prieto, Sr.
 etc., et al., respondents," as well as of its resolution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  denying petitioners’ motion for reconsideration.
<p>
Records show that the herein petitioners had filed Civil Case No. 256 
before the then Court of First Instance of Isabela, Branch IV, for the 
recovery of possession and ownership of four parcels of land at Bagnos, 
Aurora, Isabela, with damages, against Glicerio Domingo, married to 
Salud Espiritu.  After due hearing, the lower court rendered judgment on
 July 29, 1981 declaring the petitioners as the absolute owners of the 
land in suit and ordering, <em>inter alia</em>, the defendants and the 
tenants they instituted to vacate and deliver the possession of the 
subject land to the petitioners, as the plaintiffs below.
</p><p>
On August 14, 1981, the lower court, on motion of the petitioners duly 
opposed by the defendants, issued an Order declaring the above-judgment 
immediately executory pending appeal.  In said order, however, the 
execution of the decision as against the tenants was stayed "until the 
principal case is finally decided by the Appellate Court should the 
defendants decide to appeal."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
On August 21, 1981, the herein private respondents who are claiming to 
be the legitimate tenants of the four parcels of land subject of Civil 
Case No. 256, filed a special civil action of <em>certiorari </em>with 
the respondent appellate court to annul and set aside the decision of 
the lower court in so far as it ordered them to vacate and deliver to 
the petitioners the possession of the litigated property, on the ground 
that the assailed judgment is null and void for having been rendered 
without jurisdiction, they being not parties to the case.  They 
complained that from the time the above-mentioned decision of the lower 
court dated July 29, 1981 was ren­dered, the herein petitioners have 
been harassing and molesting them, telling them to vacate the premised 
of the land in suit.
</p><p>
On March 22, 1982, the respondent court rendered the herein questioned 
decision setting aside that portion of the judgment of the lower court 
adverse to the herein private respondents upon a finding that the 
latter, not being parties to Civil Case No. 256 and therefore not given 
the opportunity to be heard, cannot be ordered to vacate the premises of
 the disputed land, otherwise, their constitutional right to due process
 would thereby be infringed.  Unable to obtain a reconsideration, the 
present petition was filed.
</p><p>
Whether the respondent appellate court acted with grave abuse of 
discretion in declaring as null and void and in setting aside the 
judgment of the lower court in so far as it orders the herein private 
respondents to vacate and deliver the possession of their landholdings 
to the herein petitioners, is a question which need not be resolved in 
this petition for review, in view of the express manifestation and 
assurance of the petitioners that private respondents will not be 
removed as tenants of the disputed land.  As petitioners themselves 
alleged, such issue has been rendered moot and academic.
</p><p>
Petitioners, however, pray that private respondents be directed to 
deliver to them the landowner's share of the produce of the subject 
parcels of land pursuant to the decision of the lower court declaring 
them as owners thereof.  Considering, however, that the defendants in 
Civil Case No. 256 has appealed the judgment of the lower court, which 
appeal is pending before the now Intermediate Appellate Court, docketed 
as CA-G. R. No. 70195-R, and considering further that the records do not
 show whether the Order of the lower court dated August 14, 1981 
declaring its judgment immediately executory pending appeal was executed
 or not, and it appearing that the parties had entered into an 
agree­ment dated November 22, 1982 whereby it is agreed that the 
landowner's share of the harvest be deposited with Ernesto Subia, owner 
of a bonded warehouse, to wait for the final outcome of the case, the 
remedy which appears best and reasonable under the circumstances is to 
direct the parties to abide with their above-mentioned agreement.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered directing the private 
respondents, as the admitted tenants of the subject parcels of land, to 
deposit the landowner's share of their harvest with Ernesto Subia, as 
above indicated, to await the final disposition of the appeal in CA-G.R.
 No. 70195-R.
SO ORDERED.
