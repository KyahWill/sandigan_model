COURT OF APPEALS AND FILEMON P. RUIZ, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>MELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In their petition for review filed under Rule 45, petitioners
seek the review and the consequent reversal of the decision of the Court of
Appeals sustaining the dismissal by the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>their complaint against private respondent Filemon Ruiz, on
the ground of failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' cause of action as alleged in the complaint is
culled by the Court of Appeals in its Decision thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs sought to annul the sale of two (2) parcels of
land situated in Barrio Sapang, Ternate, Cavite, x x x, in favor of defendants
spouses Danilo Andra and Angela Olano, then to defendants spouses Amado Ibañez
and Esther Rafael?Ibañez, and finally to defendant Filemon P. Ruiz; and
Original Certificate of Title No. P-3746 and Transfer Certifi­cates of Title
Nos. T-242173, T-242510 and T-242645 on the ground of illegality in the
execution of the deed of sale and issuance of the certificates of title.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As gathered from the allegations of appellants' complaint,
after the sale of the parcels <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>land
in question to defendants spouses Amado O. Ibañez and Esther Rafael-Ibañez, on
May 11, 1981, Original Certificate of Title No. P-33746 was issued in their
favor upon free patent granted (Annex I, Complaint, p. 21, rec.).  Said defendants spouses transferred
ownership of the parcels of land in question to Masuwerte Rural Bank of Bacoor,
Inc., whereupon OCT NO. P-3746 was cancelled and Transfer Certificate of Title
No. T-242173 was issued in the name of the bank (Annex K, Complaint, p. 23,
rec.).  Ownership to the said parcels of
land was then re-acquired by said defendants spouses, whereupon TCT No.
T-242173 was cancelled and TCT No. T-242510 was issued in their names (Annex L,
Complaint, p. 24, rec.).  Said
defendants finally conveyed the parcels of land in question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>the appellee, whereupon TCT No.
T-242510 was cancelled and TCT No. T-242645 was issued in his name (Annex M,
Complaint, p. 71, rec.)." (pp. 76-77, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining the dismissal, respondent Court of Appeals, through
Justice Pedro A. Ramirez, ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Nothing is alleged in appellants' complaint showing that
appellee was aware of any defect in the title of the sellers of the parcels of
land in question, much less anything in their title to place him in notice
thereof.  Hence, appellee is an innocent
purchaser for value and in good faith, as correctly held by the trial
court.  Appellants, therefore, have no
cause of action against him." (pp. 78-79, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Affirmance of the respondent court's action is in order,
consistent with our previous ruling in a similar case that --</p>

<blockquote>“. . . the lower court is right in observing in the order appealed
from that there is no allegation at all in appellants' complaint that they are
purchasers in bad faith or with notice of the alleged defect in the (Torrens)
title of their vendor, with the result that the allegations of said pleading
are not sufficient to constitute a cause of action against them." (Galvez
vs. Tuazon, 10 SCRA 344 [1964], at p. 348.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, while the complaint stated that private respondent's
predecessors-in-interest succeeded in securing a Torrens title covering the
subject properties, it failed to state that private respondent was aware of any
flaw in the title or of any circumstance to put him on notice of petitioners'
claim of an adverse interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there the least hint in the complaint about private
respondent's involvement in an actionable wrong violative of petitioners'
supposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">proprietary </span>rights.  No statement is therein made of private
respondent's participation in the transfer of the subject property from the
spouses Andra and Olano to Amado Ibañez (the seller to private respondent) and
in the manner the latter secured <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>free
patent title over the same property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only possible allusion to private respondent's measure of
culpability is found in paragraph 13 of the complaint which states that
"thru strategy and scheme and in conspiracy and in connivance with the
other defendants <u>or some of them</u>, the defendants Spouses Amado Ibañez
and Esther Rafael caused to transfer, as in fact they actually conveyed and
transferred the properties covered by TCT No. T-242510 in favor of their
co-defendant Filemon P. Ruiz" (p. 33, Rollo).  The deficiency of the averment is at once apparent.  There is no specific statement that the
alleged conspiracy was intended to unlawfully deprive petitioners of their
property.  There is no submission that
private respondent knew of such unlawful intent and knowingly participated
therein.  There is no allegation that
private respondent otherwise committed an actionable wrong prejudicial to
petitioners.  Absent such averments, an
essential element of a cause of action is missing, which is an act or omission
on the part of private respondent in violation of petitioner's legal
right.  Such a complaint must succumb to
a motion to dismiss on the ground of failure to state a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">cause </span>of action (<u>Tantuico, Jr. vs. Republic</u>, 204 SCRA 428
[1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">At most the averments <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>they
are formulated merely tend to show the fact of transfer to private respondent,
but certainly fail to point to any taint or nullifying circumstance in said
transfer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The supposed assertion by private respondent of posses­sory right
as alleged in paragraph 14 of the complaint is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">but </span>an incident of his title, which petitioners admitted and the
validity of which the complaint failed to adequately challenge.  Such act, admitted hypothetically, does not
give rise to a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further demonstrating the inadequacy of the complaint is the admission
therein that private respondent's predecessor acquired a free patent title over
the subject property in <u>1981</u> (Annex I, Complaint; p. 49, Rollo).  As correctly held by respondent Court of
Appeals, the subject pieces of property were, from then on, brought under the
operation of the Land Registration Act.  The original certificate of title issued on the strength of the Free
Patent being in the nature of a certificate issued in a judicial proceeding
became indefeasible and incontrovertible upon the expiration of one (1) year
from date of issuance thereof.  Hence,
the case commenced seven years thereafter, in 1988, was filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, there being no reversible error in the decision
under review, the petition is dismissed.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
