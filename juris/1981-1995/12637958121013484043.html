				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In an Information that was filed by the Assistant Fiscal in the
then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Manaay</span>
was charged of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 18600.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said crime was allegedly committed in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 22nd day of May, 1968, in the
municipality of San Juan, pro­vince of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and
there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one
Marina <span class="SpellE">Pacaoncis</span>, against her will and consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Together with the above-quoted information another one was filed
charging the accused-appellant of a second crime of rape which was allegedly
perpetrated on the same complainant, this time on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 18601.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the appellant entered a plea of not guilty on
both charges of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Trial on the
merits ensued and, thereafter, a decision was rendered by the trial court
convicting the appellant of the crime as charged in Criminal Case No.
18600.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant was
acquitted in Criminal Case No. 18601.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositve</span> portion of the trial court's
Decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 18600, the accused is found
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and is sentenced to <u>life
imprisonment</u> and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In Criminal Case No. 18601, for failure of the prosecution to prove
his guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the accused is acquitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">of </span>the crime of rape with costs <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, the appellant interposed this appeal
alleging that the trial court committed the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF
THE COMPLAINANT WHICH WAS FRAUGHT WITH SERIOUS DOUBT, AND THEREFORE, CLEARLY
APPEARS TO BE INCREDIBLE AND UNBELIEVABLE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED AS PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE
WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SUSTAIN SUCH CONVICTION.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The opposing parties presented conflicting versions of the facts
material to the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the appealed
decision, the version of the prosecution is related as follows, which is
substantially borne by the records -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution version was established primarily through the
testimony of the complainant Marina <span class="SpellE">Pacaonsis</span>, an 18
year old girl.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified that on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1968</st1:date>, she was employed as a
maid in the household of the accused located at <st1:address><st1:street>175 P.
  Benito Street</st1:street>, <st1:city>San Juan</st1:city></st1:address>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon on <st1:date year="1968" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1968</st1:date>, while she was ironing
clothes, the accused asked her to bring a glass of water inside his room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After entering the room which was on the
second floor of the house, and handing over the glass of water, the accused suddenly
locked the room and ordered the complainant to sit on his bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complying with the order, the complainant
asked the accused why <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">she </span>was being made to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But instead of replying, the accused quickly embraced the complainant
and began to unbutton the front portion of her blouse and skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sensing that the accused was up to something
bad, the complainant par­ried his hands prompting the accused, who was then in
brief underwear, to slap her on the face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result, the complainant fell on the bed and immediately the accused
boxed her on the left and right upper arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the struggle that ensued, the accused was able to partly unbutton the
blouse of the complainant which he raised up to her shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the accused delivered a hard
blow on the pit of her stomach while she was lying on the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the pain she suffered and be­cause
of the superior force exerted by the accused, the complainant was unable to
fight back and could only shout for help to Domingo, the houseboy, who was then
the only one inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to
fear, however, Domingo failed to res­pond and the accused continued slapping
and removing the clothes of the complai­nant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At that time, the wife of the accused was attending a party together
with her children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the complainant was hit on the stomach and disrobed, except
for her bra, she began to feel dizzy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While about to faint or lose consciousness, she felt pain on her private
part when the accused in­serted his organ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the lapse of what she thought was several minutes, and after
regaining fully her consciousness, the com­plainant felt her whole body
throbbing with pain and discovered that her private part was bloody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the corner of the room, she saw the
accused trying to put on his under­wear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When the complainant stood up, got her clothes and put them on and when
she was about to leave the room, the accused talked to her briefly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He threatened to kill her if she would reveal
to anybody what happened on that fateful afternoon, Since she was too scared to
say anything, the complainant, however, simply went downstairs where she cried
her heart out and fixed her clothes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the following day, after she was raped, the accused continued to
order the complainant to do some chores in the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he never stopped threatening her as he
even went to the extent of saying that he would shoot her should she leave the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the complainant learned
later on that the accused had even asked the houseboy to keep watch over her so
that she could not leave the house without any companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite what had happened, the complainant,
however, continued working in the house of the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the complainant, she was again abused by the
accused-appellant on <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also testified on the story behind this
second alleged rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's narration of facts continues, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the following
morning, on <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1968</st1:date>,
she, then cried and com­plained to the wife of the accused reporting to her
what had occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She showed her bloody
panty to her but Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manaay</span>, who was afraid of the
accused, merely gave her a bottle of medicine to take which was bitter in
taste.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also requested the
complainant not to tell her children what had happened.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the following day, on <st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="6">June
 29, 1968</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">t</span>he
complainant asked a neighbor to get in touch with <span class="SpellE">Lita</span>,
her friend, so she could fetch her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the afternoon of that day, <span class="SpellE">Lita</span> and her sister,
together with Lorna, arrived at the house and handed to the complainant a
telegram which was to be delivered to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The telegram was a message from her parents
from the <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> asking her to come home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But when the complainant handed the telegram
to the accused, the latter tore it into pieces and said that the complainant
was just a nuisance to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused
became particularly angry when the complainant asked permission to leave and he
tried to box <span class="SpellE">Lita</span> who came to fetch her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, the com­plainant, together with <span class="SpellE">Lita</span> and her compa­nions, were able to leave the house and
on the way out, the complainant narrated to her companions, who cried with her,
the ordeal she went through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For about
one week, the complainant stayed in <span class="SpellE">Lita's</span> house
until her aunt, Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Amorante</span>, came and fetched
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since then she had lived with her
aunt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1968</st1:date>,
the complainant submitted herself to a medico-legal exami­nation at the Manila
Police Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings of Dr.
Mariano B. Lara, the Medico Legal Officer, were as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Under his first
assignment of error, the appellant assails the credibility of the complainant's
testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said testimony is alle­gedly
fraught with serious doubts and appears to be incredible and unbelievable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's arguments in support of this
position revolved around the allegation that the sexual act between him and the
complainant was voluntary rather than forced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">According to the
appellant, the complainant contradicted her­self when during her direct examination
she testified that she became "unconscious" after being rained with
body blows, while during her cross-examination she made it appear that she was
at least partly aware of what was happening to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court characterized her condition as
being "dizzy".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition,
the appellant contends that if the complainant wanted to avoid having sexual
intercourse, she could have done any of the following acts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She was then at
liberty to open the room and run out (since the door could be opened from the
inside);<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She could put-up
adequate resistance until her dress and panty were torn out because then her
condition was just 'dizzy', not unconscious;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She could have

resistance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The complainant was most
probably just at a loss as to the correct term to describe her condition during
her direct examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she
ably corrected and explained, much to our satisfaction, her earlier declaration
during her cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the dis­puted
Decision, the trial court put it this way:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is true that during her direct examination, the
complainant testified that after having been hit on the stomach she became
unconscious and regained her consciousness only after the lapse of ten (10)
minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this particular
portion of the testimony was sufficiently explained by the complainant during
her cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to her,
when she testified that she became unconscious, what she really meant was that
she became very dizzy most probably because of the traumatic experience she was
then under­going."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">With respect to the
appellant's suggestions earlier enumerated as to the possible courses of action
that the complainant should have taken, suffice it to quote some portions from

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The complainant's failure

caused by the thought of the proximity of danger with the appellant having made
serious threats of killing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed

otherwise, the sexual act must have been done with mutual consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the appellant's theory that without
these considerations, the evidence is insufficient.</p>

<p class="BODY">This view finds no basis either in law or in jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">A medical examination is not an indispensable element in the
prosecution for the crime of rape, because it all depends upon the evidence
offered and as long as such evidence convinces the court, a conviction <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is proper.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, the prosecution in this case actually submitted a medical
certificate as evidence to the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was prepared, attested to, and duly affirmed on testimony by the
medico-legal officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings
therein with regards to the condition of the complainant's sexual organ fully
corroborated the theory of the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was not possible to submit another medical certificate as to the
marks that the com­plainant sustained since she was only able to submit herself
to a medical examination on <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="9">September
 1, 1968</st1:date>, or about three months after the rape was committed, the
time she was able to leave the house of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-presentation of the torn panty of the complainant is not
fatal to the case of the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not at all indispensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
consonance with the preceding discussion, a con­viction depends upon the
persuasiveness of the totality of the evidence offered, not on a single piece
of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant was subjected to a thorough and <span class="SpellE">gruelling</span> cross-examination by two alternating defense
counsels for about two years and four months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
