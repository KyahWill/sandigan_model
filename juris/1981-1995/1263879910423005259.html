				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The private respondent's counsel has acted quite in character <span style="">up </span>to the end and even unto this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court should not
have been so forbearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent lost in a suit for damages in the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appealed to the respondent court and on
May 17, 1989, was required to file its brief within 45 days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notice was received by its counsel on May
24, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 45-day period expired on July 8, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No brief had been <span style="">filed </span>by the appellant nor had it at least moved for extension
of time to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1989, the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals issued a resolution
requiring the private respondent to show <span class="GramE">cause</span> why its
appeal should not be considered abandoned or dismissed for its failure to file
the appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was ignored
by the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1989, the petitioner filed a motion for the
dismissal of the private respondent's appeal for failure to file the
appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No action having been
taken thereon, it was reiterated on December 12, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no reaction from the private
respondent to either of the two motions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>December 11,
1989, <u><span style="">two hundred and one </span></u><u><span style="">days</span></u><span style=""> </span>from the
start of the 45-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period and after the
expiration of the 10-day period to show cause, the respondent court dismissed
the private respondent's appeal pursuant to Section 1(f), Rule 50 of the Rules
of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was only after more than a month, on January 17, 1990, that
the private respondent roused itself and filed <span style="">a </span>motion for reconsideration of the
dismissal of its appeal and for the admission of the appellant's brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its counsel alleged that an employee of
another client had taken the records of the case and had returned them only
after Christmas of 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also averred
that it could not file the appeal brief on time because of the aborted <u><span style="">coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>in December of that year and the
frequent power <span style="">interruptions in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> area, where its office was located.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An opposition was filed by the petitioner, but the motion was
granted by the respondent court on February 21, 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The resolution read in part:</p>

<blockquote>The court has no way to determine the veracity of the claim of
defendant-appellant's counsel that an employee of another client took the
records of the case from his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion filed has no affidavit attached to the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the court could take judicial notice
of the electrical power interruption at <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> <span style="">as </span>well <span style="">as </span>the occurrence of the aborted coup.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, in the interest of substantial justice, the
resolution dated December 11, 1989 dismissing the a<span style="">pp</span>eal interposed by defendant-appellant is hereby RECONSIDERED
and the Brief filed is ADMITTED and <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are <span style="">given </span>the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period of forty-five (45) days within which to file <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's own motion for reconsideration having been
denied, it has come to this Court to fault the reinstatement of the appeal with
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find at the outset, considering the ground invoked, that the
petitioner should have filed <span style="">a </span>special civil action for <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court rather than a petition for review on <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>under Rule 45.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall disregard this procedural lapse,
however, to correct the obvious flaw in the challenged resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conduct of the private respondent and its counsel reveals a
careless disregard of the Rules of Court <span style="">and,
indeed, even a contemptuous rejection of the authority of the respondent court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Required to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for
failure to file the appellant's brief,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the private respondent and its
counsel saw fit not to dignify the warning with a response.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only after the respondent court had dismissed
the appeal did it occur to them to move for reconsideration, and for reasons
too flimsy to be believed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court itself noted that the motion for
reconsideration carried no supporting affidavits to prove the grounds
alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing of how the
<u><span style="">coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>and the power interruptions prevented
the private respondent's counsel from filing the appellant's brief on
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notably, the period for the filing
of the brief began on May 24, 1989, long before the failed <span style="">November-December </span><u><span style="">coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span></span></u><span style="">.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Other law offices similarly inconvenienced by the attempted <u><span style="">coup <span class="SpellE">d'etat</span></span></u><span style=""> </span>and the power interruptions have not
been similarly remiss as the private respondent's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of them have pleaded for more time to
meet 15-day or 30-day deadlines and have been accommodated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is different <span style="">in </span>the case at bar, where the private respondent's counsel had
delayed for more than four months and had not even asked for an <span style="">extension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Given
</span>this inexcusable delay, the respondent court should not have been so
tolerant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
no less than the appellant, <span style="">was </span>entitled to speedy justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether deliberate or not, the non-filing of the appellant's brief <span style="">on time </span>had
the effect of postponing action on the judgment the petitioner had already won
in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reinstating the
appeal, the respondent court allowed itself to emasculate the policy of
expeditious judicial action mandated by the Constitution itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has to be noted that the irresponsibility of the private
respondent's counsel did not stop at the respondent court but has marred even
the proceedings in this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In our resolution
dated June 20, 1990, we required the private respondent to file <span style="">a </span>Comment on the petition within ten
days from notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No such Comment was
filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same counsel was required in
the resolution dated January 23, 1991, to show <span class="GramE">cause</span>
why it should not be disciplined for failure to submit its Comment, and to
comply with the Court's resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
has completely ignored that warning as if this Court did not deserve its
attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">We will not countenance such disrespect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All lawyers are expected to recognize the
authority of the Supreme Court and obey its lawful processes and orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the failure of the private respondent to
submit its Comment, we have dispensed with and resolved this petition on the
basis of the pleadings and other available documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, for its intransigence and <span style="">as a </span>warning
to other lawyers who may be similarly disposed, the law office of Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Palabyab</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llorin</span> and Associates
is hereby fined <span style="">in </span>the amount of One Thousand Pesos, to be <span style="">paid to the Cashier of the Court within ten days from notice of this
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any further disrespect or
disobedience of this Court by the said law firm shall be dealt with more
severely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not show if the private respondent <span style="">condoned </span>or
contributed to its counsel's negligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it did not and feels it has reason to complain, it may file
administrative charges against such counsel with the Integrated Bar of the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Procedural rules are not to be disdained as mere technicalities
that may be ignored at will to suit the convenience of a party.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adjective law <span style="">is </span>important in insuring the
effective enforcement of substantive rights through the orderly and speedy
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These rules
are not intended to hamper litigants or complicate litigation but, indeed, to
provide for <span style="">a
</span>system under which suitors may be heard in the correct form and manner
and at the prescribed time in <span style="">a </span>peaceful confrontation before a judge
whose authority they <span style="">acknowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other alternative is the settlement of
their conflict through the barrel of a gun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the resolution of
the respondent court reinstating the appeal in CA-GR CV No. 20225 is SET ASIDE,
with costs against the private respondent.</p>
