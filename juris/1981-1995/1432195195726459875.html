				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In the Court of First Instance of Batangas, Branch V, at Lipa City, an amended information for robbery with rape was filed against Wilfredo L. Reglos, Anastacio L. Brozo and Antonio B. Fullon. The amended information was docketed as Criminal Case No. 92 and reads: <blockquote> <p>"That on or about the 27th day of August, 1975, in Sabang, Lipa City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together, acting in common accord, and mutually aiding one another, by means of force, violence and intimidation, upon the person of Iris Mindanao, and without the knowledge and consent of the owner thereof, with intent of gain, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, rob, and carry away one (1) wrist watch, one (1) ring with seven stones and one (1) umbrella, with a total value of P320.00, belonging to said Iris Mindanao, and the same accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have carnal knowledge of the offended party, who was at that time deprived of reason."</p> </blockquote> <p>After trial, the court held that "robbery was not proved." However, it "arrived at an inescapable conclusion, that the prosecution had proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and the three accused: WILFREDO REGLOS, ANASTACIO BROZO, and ANTONIO FULLON, are individually GUILTY OF RAPE." The court rendered the following judgment:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, each of the said accused, shall suffer an indeterminate sentence of from TEN (10) YEARS, TWO (2) MONTHS and TWENTY (20) DAYS of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum, to SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS and FOUR (4) MONTHS of <em>reclusion temporal</em> as maximum, with the accessories of the law, and to pay the costs. They shall further jointly pay Iris Mindanao or her assigns, the amount of P12,000.00 as damages."</p> </blockquote> <p>Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code defines rape and provides for its punishment. The lowest penalty for rape is <em>reclusion perpetua</em> which is also known as life imprisonment. Accordingly, it passes understanding why the trial court imposed an indeterminate sentence on each of the accused when the Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4102, as amended by Act No. 4225) stipulates that it shall not apply, <em>inter alia,</em> to persons convicted of offenses punished with life imprisonment. (Sec. 2.) And the error of the trial court was compounded when the Solicitor General stated in the People's brief that, "IN VIEW HEREOF, <em>the penalty imposed being in accordance with law</em> and the evidence, affirmance thereof is respectfully recommended, with costs." (On Page 21. Italics supplied.)</p> <p>Reglos and Brozo did not appeal their conviction. Their decision has inured to their benefit because although the penalty meted to them is erroneous, it is not void for the trial court had jurisdiction to impose it.</p> <p>As to Fullon, he filed a notice that he was appealing the decision to the Court of Appeals. Under the circumstances the designation of the Court of Appeals as the appellate court was correct. Thereafter, Judge Demetrio M. Batario, Jr. who penned the decision issued this amazing order:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The Record on Appeal having been duly certified by the Deputy Clerk of Court pursuant to Supreme Court Administrative Circular #2 as amended, and finding it to be in order, the same is hereby approved."</p> </blockquote> <p>We have searched for the Record on Appeal but Our efforts have been in vain. There is, however, no cause to get excited because after all is said and done a Record on Appeal is not called for in criminal cases. What Circular No. 2, as amended by Circular No. 4 which was issued on August 21, 1978, requires is the elevation of the <em>expediente,</em> the folio of exhibits and the transcript of stenographic notes.</p> <p>It turned out, however, that the transcript of the notes taken by stenographer Honesto Reyes was not elevated to the Court of Appeals. The missing transcript was for the trial held on October 13, 1976. On June 9, 1980, the Court of Appeals ordered Reyes to submit the transcript. But Reyes could not comply because he had died. Accordingly, on August 27, 1980, the Court of Appeals ordered a re-taking of the testimony of Florante Reyles and Iris Mindanao who testified on October 13, 1976. The testimony of Florante Reyles was re-taken on February 2, 1981, but Iris Mindanao was no longer able to testify because her mental condition had deteriorated. At the conclusion of the hearing on February 2, 1981, the trial court made the following statement:</p> <blockquote> <p>"COURT:</p> <p>Considering that the testimony of Iris Mindanao could be produced plus the new testimony of Dr. F.P. Reyles, these documents are ordered attached to the record of Crim. Case No. V-92 for transmission to the Court of Appeals."</p> </blockquote> <p>Included in the records is a partial transcript of the hearing held on October 13, 1976, consisting of the direct and cross examination of Florante Reyles (whose testimony was re-taken on February 2, 1981) consisting of 54 pages and a portion of the direct examination of Iris Mindanao covering pages 59 to 81. Presumably stenographer Reyes was the one who prepared the transcript but could not finish it because of his death. At any rate, with the transcripts on hand, especially that covering the lengthy cross-examination of Iris Mindanao on November 11, 1976, consisting of 190 pages, We believe that justice can be administered in this case.</p> <p>In a situation such as the one recounted above, We urge the Court of Appeals to detail the facts for the information of all concerned. As it is, the Court of Appeals said nothing about the situation.</p> <p>On June 28, 1982, Fullon filed in the Court of Appeals a motion wherein he stated, among other things:</p> <blockquote> <p>"1. That the undersigned accused-appellant is already incarcerated for more than seven (7) years, to date, and he is at present detained at the Camp Sampaguita, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila;</p> <p>"2. That the undersigned accused-appellant is not granted the rights and privileges, which are given to insular prisoners, for reasons that he is still classified as detention prisoner;</p> <p>"3. That he is withdrawing his appeal, for reason that he wanted to avail of all the rights and privileges, granted under the law, to prisoners, and in order to have a peace of mind." (Rollo, p. 36.)</p> </blockquote> <p>It does not appear that the motion was submitted to the 8th Division of the Court of Appeals. On the contrary, it seems that motion was not submitted for at the bottom of the motion is the handwritten: <em>"Note. Out of time. Draft of decision approved June 1982."</em> But it was only on July 30, 1982, that the 8th Division with Sison, PV (<em>as ponente</em>), Victoriano and Colayco, <em>JJ</em>. promulgated the decision. The first and second paragraphs of the decision reads:</p> <blockquote> <p>"For raping a mentally ill woman in Lipa City on August 27, 1975 the three (3) accused in this case were sentenced to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>. Only one accused has appealed. The two others are already serving their sentence.</p> <p>"Indicted and tried of the complex offense of robbery with rape upon a plea of not guilty and, after trial, convicted of rape, Wilfredo Reglos, Anastacio Brozo and Antonio Fullon were sentenced each to suffer an indeterminate penalty from 10 years, 2 months and 20 days of <em>prision mayor</em> to 17 years and 4 months of <em>reclusion temporal,</em> with the accessories of the law, to jointly indemnify their victim, Iris Mindanao or her assigns, in the sum of P12,000.00 as damages, and to pay the costs." (Rollo, p. 56.)</p> </blockquote> <p>It is at once obvious that there is no congruence between the two paragraphs of the decision but three pairs of eyes failed to notice the mistake.</p> <p>Fullon has reason to despair. If his motion to withdraw the appeal had been acted by the Court of Appeals, he would have benefitted from the wrong but nonetheless valid indeterminate sentence. But alas, the Court of Appeals found him guilty of rape and pronounced the following:</p> <blockquote> <p>"WHEREFORE, the decision of conviction should be as it is hereby affirmed in all its parts. The imposable penalty, however, should be <em>reclusion perpetua,</em> pursuant to Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 2632, enacted June 18, 1960, and Republic Act No. 4111, enacted June 20, 1964, raising the penalty for rape to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> to death, even in the presence of mitigating and aggravating circumstances (People <em>vs</em>. Arizala y Flores, G.R. No. 59713, March 15, 1982), <em>reclusion perpetua</em> being an indivisible penalty.</p> <p>"Despite our factual findings, let the records of the case be forthwith forwarded to the Honorable Supreme Court, for proper disposition in accordance with laws and authorities (Sec. 17, par. No. 4, sub-par. No. (4), Judiciary Act of 1948; Rule 124, Sec. 12, New Rules of Court; People <em>vs</em>. Daniel, L-40330, and People <em>vs</em>. Ramos, L-49818)." (Rollo, p. 68.)</p> </blockquote> <p>And so on September 1, 1982, We accepted the case.</p> <p>The People's version of the facts is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"At about six o'clock in the morning of August 27, 1975, the victim Iris Mindanao left her home in Barangay Talahiban, San Juan, Batangas, for the purpose of going to church in Lipa City. (tsn, p. 61, Oct. 13, 1976) After praying awhile inside the church at Lipa City, the victim went to a bakery nearby to take a snack, and because she did not have the necessary money to pay for what she took she left her watch with the store owner. (tsn, p. 96, Nov 11, 1976) Thereafter she walked towards the place where the jeepneys going to San Juan usually parked with the intention of going home. (tsn, p. 84, Nov. 11, 1976) While walking, accused Antonio Fullon (appellant), who was driving a passenger tricycle, offered her a ride which she accepted. (p. 85, <em>id</em>.) Instead of conducting her to the place where she intended to go, appellant went cruising around the city of Lipa for more than three (3) hours (tsn, p. 20, July 25, 1977). In one instance appellant stopped his tricycle at the Lipa City Park and initiated amorous advances towards the victim. The latter rebuffed accused by scratching him (tsn, p. 24, July 25, 1977), causing upon his arms some nail scratches injury. Frustrated, accused proceeded with the victim to the poblacion of Lipa (p.25, <em>id</em>.). Upon passing a drugstore, accused stopped his tricycle and bought a bottle of merthiolate. He applied it to his fingernail scratches inflicted by the victim. Thereafter, they proceeded and at this instant, accused's tricycle had a flat-tire and so he called upon Anastacio Brozo, another tricycle driver to accommodate them.</p> <p>"Appellant together with Anastacio Brozo and Wilfredo Reglos brought the victim to a secluded place in Barrio Sabang, Lipa City, where they took turns in forcibly deflowering her." (Brief, pp. 5-6.)</p> </blockquote> <p>Iris Mindanao's testimony in her direct examination concerning the rape is brief and simple. She said that she was 20 years old, single and a resident of Barrio Talahiban, San Juan, Batangas. In the morning of August 27, 1975, she left her house at about 6:00 o'clock in the morning for Lipa City to hear mass at the cathedral which is near the Lipa City Colleges. On that occasion, Antonio Fullon, Anastacio Brozo and Wilfredo Reglos "took advantage" of her.

Ilagan, Jr. who represented appellant Fullon, Iris testified that she reached Lipa City at about 9:30 a.m., prayed at the cathedral for a few minutes and then rode on a tricycle driven by Antonio Fullon so that she could board a jeepney elsewhere to return to San Juan. Instead of going to her destination, Fullon took her "round and round" Lipa City and then to a sugar plantation in Barrio Sabang.

Calderon, a resident physician at the Lipa City Hospital, testified for the prosecution. His testimony as summarized by the trial court is as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"Dr. Wilbrodo Calderon, physician and medico-legal officer of Lipa City Hospital, in substance testified: 'I remember having physically examined accused: (with Medical Certificates Exh. "H", "G" &amp; "I" respectively for) Reglos, Brozo and Fullon on August 28, 1975 at about 11:00 P.M., and also Iris Mindanao (Exh. "F" &amp; "F-1", dated Aug. 27, 1975) allegedly rape. I performed upon her complete examination including genitalia with vaginal smear, and issued medical certificate Exh. "F" showing: ABRASION - forehead, cheeks, chin, arm bilateral-multiple linear abrasions; forearm, left linear abrasions; thigh right; INTERNAL EXAMINATION - Hymen complete laceration with fresh bleeding; Vagina - easily admits one finger admits 2 fingers with slight difficulty. Examining finger with fresh blood; Vaginal smear taken duplicate copy attached; CONDITION OF PATIENT ON DATE ATTENDED: conscious, loquacious, at times incoherent. PATIENT - admitted. (SGD.).' 'Hymen - complete laceration with fresh bleeding could have been caused by sexual intercourse. The vagina-smear Exh. "F-1" by microscopic examination shows sperms within the vagina. Iris told me somebody sexually assaulted her. From her wounds, it could be assumed that force and violence were employed upon her. Medical Certificates show for: Brozo - 'No evidence of external injury'; Reglos 'Abrasion periorbital area, right; Finger nail like scratch nuchal area; Linear abrasions left arm lateral aspect; Multiple finger nail like scratches, forearm, right and left; Abrasion thigh 3 inches above knee'; Fullon - 'Finger nail like scratches on: infrascapular area, medial aspect right arm, multiple right forearm; lateral, forearm, left.' Inasmuch as I did not find any injury on Brozo, I became quite inquisitive and asked how did it happen, and the two told me that the two of them were holding Iris Mindanao while Brozo was having sexual intercourse.' The doctor answered: 'Yes, Sir' to the question 'Would you say doctor that they admitted, that they raped the girl?' Fullon's four wounds show finger nail like scratches in the scapular area as well as the other scratches could have been caused possibly by struggle of a woman trying to extricate herself from the hold of a man. I did not ask Fullon and Reglos why they had those injuries. On cross-examination by Fullon's counsel, the doctor disclosed: 'One of them which I could not remember his name, was the one who told me that the two of them were holding (Iris) while Brozo was on top of Miss Iris Mindanao. I was the one who obtained the vaginal smear and it was the medical technologist who made the microscopic examination (with report) using code. On further cross-examination by Reglos' counsel he added: 'The hymen of Iris Mindanao was a complete laceration. The sperms in her vagina could only come from a man. I found fresh blood in the vaginal area which is not caused by menstruation.'" (Decision, pp. 4-6.)</p> </blockquote> <p>The defense of Fullon is that he had no sexual intercourse with Iris Mindanao.</p> <p>Testifying on direct examination, Fullon said that he was 24 years old, married, driver and a resident of Lipa City. On August 26, 1975, at about 11:30 a.m. Iris Mindanao boarded his tricycle. He was told to drive to Marauoy.

(Brief, p. 9.)</p> <p>In most rape cases, only the complainant is able or willing to give direct evidence. The case at bar is no exception. However, the uncorroborated testimony of the victim is entitled to great weight and is sufficient to convict if it meets the test of credibility.</p> <p>We are of the opinion that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals correctly appreciated the evidence as proving the case for the prosecution. There is no doubt that Iris Mindanao was raped on August 27, 1975. Iris said so and the acceptance by Brozo and Reglos of their conviction by not appealing is an affirmation of such fact. It only remains to be determined whether or not Fullon also raped the complainant.</p> <p>The testimony of Iris regarding the rape on her by Fullon is simple, direct and convincing. It must prevail over the general denial of the appellant. The assignment of credibility by the trial court must be respected because it had the advantage of observing the witnesses and there is nothing in the record which would justify a deviation from the rule.</p> <p>The appellant claims that the testimony of Iris "a confirmed schizophrenic is highly illogical." True it is that Dr. Florante P. Reyles, a physician at the Mental Hospital, testified that Iris had been confined at said hospital since 1971, and re-admitted in 1975. She was suffering from schizophrenia which, according to Dr. Reyles, is a mental disease characterized by loss of orientation; the individual becomes alien to reality. It is also called split or dual personality.</p> <p>Iris was given a pass by the hospital on April 26, 1976, and advised to return for a monthly check-up. On January 3, 1977, she was again re-admitted to the hospital for relapse of schizophrenia. It can thus be said that on August 27, 1975, when Iris was raped she was not fully mentally sound and it can be assumed that she was in the same condition when she testified on October 13, 1976, and November 11, 1976. Nonetheless, according to Dr. Reyles when he was cross-examined by the appellant's counsel:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"ATTY. ILAGAN:</td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%"><div align="center">Q</div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">So, if a rape incident occured while this patient is psychotic, she can not recall later on that incident because she was psychotic during that time that the incident transpired?</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="top"><div align="center">A</div></td> <td><div align="justify">She can, because even a psychotic person can cite an experience.

But why should they? They were not prosecution witnessess; they were the co-accused of the appellant; and if they had implicated the appellant they would have implicated themselves also.</p> <p>The trial court found that only one crime of rape was committed. The three accused, as co-conspirators, are guilty of three rapes. They helped one another in raping the victim. (See People <em>vs</em>. Babasa, L-38072, May 17, 1980, 97 SCRA 672, also involving the rape of a tricycle passenger by the driver and his two confederates.) Hence, the appellant should be sentenced to three <em>reclusion perpetuas</em>.</p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the judgment of the trial court is affirmed with the sole modification that the appellant shall suffer the penalty of three <em>reclusion perpetuas</em>. No special pronouncement as to costs.</p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p> <p><em>Makasiar (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De Castro</em> and <em>Escolin, JJ.,</em> concur.</p></div>
