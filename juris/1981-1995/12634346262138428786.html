				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition seeks to annul and set aside as having been
issued with grave abuse of discretion the order issued by the Commission on
Elections (COMELEC) <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated June 2, 1992 which directed the
Provincial Board of Canvassers of Northern Samar not to reconvene unless
instructed by the Commission, and its resolution dated June 13, 1992, insofar
as it ordered a recount of ballots for precincts 7 and 16 of the Municipality
of Silvino Lobos in Northern Samar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material facts of this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner and private respondent were candidates for the congressional
seat of the second district of Northern Samar during the recently-concluded May
11, 1992 elections.  Following the
elections, petitioner Ong garnered 24,272 votes while private respondent Lucero
obtained 24,068 votes or a difference of 204 votes as determined by the
Provincial Board of Canvassers of Northern Samar.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 25, 1992, private respondent filed a petition with the
COMELEC for the suspension of the proclamation of petitioner and for a recount
in precinct 13 since there was a failure of election occasioned by the
snatching of ballot boxes with prayer for the holding of special elections
pursuant to Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881)
and for a recount of precincts 7 and 16 pursuant to Section 234 of said code as
the election returns from said precincts were either missing or not
legible.  Private respondent also sought
the recount of 52 precincts in order to correct "manifest errors"
pursuant to Section 15 of Republic Act No. 7166<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> in
view of the disqualification of Alice Lucero, another candidate, thus leaving
him as the only candidate with that surname.  Private respondent alleged that the said three (3) precincts had a total
number of 433 registered votes, whose determination would materially affect the
result of the elections (SPA Case No. 92-282).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> On
June 2, 1992, a day before the reconvening of the Provincial Board of
Canvassers, the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc </u>ordered the said board to stop
the canvassing of votes, considering "the pendency of a pre-proclamation
controversy before the COMELEC."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

on the use of the phrase "pre-proclamation controversy” in its resolution
dated June 2, 1992 considering that he alleged only violations of Sections 6,
233 and 236 of the Omnibus Election Code and that under Section 15 of Republic
Act No. 7166, pre-proclamation cases are not allowed against candidates for the
House of Representatives.  Subsequently,
petitioner moved to lift the suspension order on June 8, 1992.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to its questioned resolution dated June 13, 1992, the
chairman and members of the COMELEC convened <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> on June 22,
1992.  On the same day, it constituted a
Special Board of Election Inspectors (BEI), a Special Municipal Board of
Canvassers (MBC) for precinct 16 and a Special Provincial Board of Canvassers

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1992, upon orders of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">COMELEC </span>the Special BEI recounted the votes from precinct 16 as
contained in an election return showing the following results:  Lucero - 43 and Ong - 2.  On the same day, the special MBC canvassed

special BEI likewise canvassed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">COMELEC's
copy </span>of the election return from precinct 7 with Ong winning 61 votes
and Lucero gaining 29 votes.  The
canvass of the election return from precinct 7 was made after the special MBC

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On June 25, 1992, this
Court acting on the instant petition filed five days earlier, resolved to grant
petitioner's prayer for a temporary restraining order and ordered the COMELEC
to cease and desist from implementing its questioned order dated June 2, 1992
and its resolution dated June 13, 1992 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Immediately upon receipt

ceased to conduct any proceeding on SPA Case No. 92-282 advising through

of Region VIII and the Provincial Board of Canvassers of Northern Samar
regarding the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the issuance of a temporary restraining order,
petitioner on July 6, 1992, filed with the Special PBC for Northern Samar an

Thereafter on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">July 8, 1992, </span>petitioner
filed with the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> an equitable petition to review
and to annul/set aside the recount made on June 23, 1992 of precinct 16 of the
Municipality of Silvino Lobos, Northern Samar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> on the ground that the
COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">banc</span></u>
committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing its order dated June 2, 1992 and
its resolution dated June 13, 1992 which ordered the chairman of the PBC of
Northern Samar not to reconvene the board and granted a recount of the ballots
in precincts 7 and 16 of the Municipality of Silvino Lobos, Northern Samar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also disputes the validity of the questioned order and
resolution as they were issued by the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc,</u> not by a
division, thereby violating Section 3, subdivision c Article IX of the 1987
Constitution.  For his part, private
respondent in his memorandum, argues that the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">banc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span>had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">jurisdiction to
issue the questioned order and resolution because one of his prayers was for
the calling of special elections in precinct 13 in the Municipality of Silvino
Lobos.  Private respondent concludes
that since at least one issue in SPA Case No. 92-282 falls within the
jurisdiction of the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc,</u> it was properly heard and decided
by it rather than by one of its divisions.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In defending the
COMELEC's position, the Solicitor General contends that since this is a case of
incomplete canvass, the COMELEC in ordering a recount, is authorized to act
upon the same to determine the true will of the electorate.  The Solicitor General also states that the
COMELEC erred in using the phrase "considering the pendency of a
pre-proclamation controversy" as contained in its order dated June 2,
1992; that such usage of the phrase was "caused by COMELEC'S excusable
negligence having in mind the numerous election-related cases pending before
it, </span>brought about by the synchronized national and local elections.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Solicitor General
likewise argues that this petition deserves to be dismissed for being moot and
academic because the June 13, 1992 resolution which granted private
respondent's prayer for a recount in precincts 7 and 16 had already been
implemented before the Temporary Restraining Order was served on the COMELEC.  It is to be noted that the recounting of
ballots from precinct 16 by the special BEI and the canvassing of election
returns made by the special MBC were consummated on June 23, 1992.  On the other hand, the canvassing of the
election returns from precinct 7 was made on June 24, 1992 or one day before
the COMELEC received the Temporary Restraining Order issued by this Court on
June 25, 1992 at 4:50 p.m.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We shall<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>resolve the issues

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">While we agree with
petitioner with regard to the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc's</u> power to rule on
the question of holding special elections for precinct 13 as clearly provided
by Section 4 of Republic Act </span>No. 7166,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> we
rule that the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">banc</span></u>
gravely abused its jurisdiction when it ordered a recount in precincts 7 and 16
because these are matters which should have been first referred to its
division, thus contravening Section 3, subdivision c of Article IX of the 1987
Constitution which expressly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.  The Commission on Elections may sit en banc or in two divisions,
and shall promulgate its rules of procedure in order to expedite disposition of
election cas<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">es, </span>including
pre-proclamation controversies.  <u>All</u>
<u>such</u> <u>election</u> <u>cases</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>heard</u> <u>and</u>
<u>decided</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>division,</u> <u>provided</u> <u>that</u> <u>motions</u>
<u>for</u> <u>reconsideration</u> <u>of</u> <u>decision</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u>
<u>decided</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By now it is well-settled that election cases which include
pre-proclamation controversies must first be heard and decided by a division of
the Commission.  The Commission <u>en</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">banc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>does not have the authority to hear
and decide it in the first instance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the order dated June 22, 1992 was issued after the
testimony of the election registrar of Severino Lobos was heard, but that is
not the main point.  The facts leading
to the issuance of the June 13, 1992 resolution did not follow the procedure laid
down in the Omnibus Election Code.  Considering that private respondent alleged that the election returns of
precinct 16 were missing, thus invoking Section 233 of the Omnibus Election
Code (Batas Pambansa Blg. 881) as amended, the Board of Canvassers should have
first obtained "such missing election returns from the board of election
inspectors concerned, or if said returns have been lost or destroyed, the Board
of Canvasser, upon prior authority of the Commission, may use any of the
authentic copies of said election returns or a certified copy of said election
returns issued by the Commission." With regard to the ambiguity of
election returns from precinct 7, the Board of Canvassers should have followed
the procedure set forth in Section 234 (Material Defects in the Election
Returns) of the Omnibus Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC indiscriminately issued the order of recount even
before the remedies under the law as stated in Sections 233 and 234 of the
Omnibus Election Code have been complied with.  We agree with petitioner that Section 233 of the Omnibus Election Code
does not authorize a recount.  Indeed,
nowhere in Section 233 is there any mention of a recount of ballots.  Instead, the remedy under said Section is a
referral to other authentic copies of election returns issued by the
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears stressing that under Sections 234, 235 and 236 of the
Omnibus Election Code, an order for a recount shall be issued only as a last
resort and only if the Commission is satisfied that the identity and integrity
of the ballots have not been violated.  So restrictive is the authority to recount that under Section 237, once
the integrity of ballots is violated, the Commission shall not order a recount
but shall seal and secure the ballot box.</p>

<p class="BODY">Had the members of the Board of Canvassers been more meticulous
in their duties, they would have examined and referred to other copies of the
election returns prior to issuing an order of recount.  Unlike in precinct 16 where the COMELEC
erroneously ordered a recount, the COMELEC upon discovery that it had in its
possession a copy of the election returns of precinct 7, issued Resolution
92-1815 dated June 23, 1992 which correctly directed the special MBC of Silvino
Lobos to canvass instead the COMELEC's copy of election returns - an authentic
copy of the election returns of said precinct.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the allegations of private respondent as contained
in his petition for the suspension of the proclamation of the winner of the
second district of Northern Samar evidently involves pre-proclamation issues,
specifically on the preparation of election returns.  Aside from his petition, private respondent alleged violations of
Sections 233 and 236 of the Omnibus Election Code as contained in his urgent
motion for clarification,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> which
are indubitably pre-proclamation matters.  Thus, the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">banc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>though it did not have the power to
issue the order dated June 2, 1992, was correct in classifying the issue at
hand as a pre-proclamation controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">As defined by Section 241 of the Omnibus Election Code:</p>

<blockquote>"A pre-proclamation controversy refers
to any question pertaining to or affecting the proceedings of the board of
canvassers which may be raised by any candidate or any registered political
party or coalition of political parties before the board or directly with the
Commission, <u>or</u> <u>any</u> <u>matter</u> <u>raised</u> <u>under</u> <u>Sections</u>
<u>233,</u> <u>234,</u> <u>235</u> <u>and</u> <u>236</u> <u>in</u> <u>relation</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>preparation,</u> <u>transmission,</u> <u>receipt,</u> <u>custody</u>
<u>and</u> <u>appreciation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>election</u> <u>returns</u>."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition, Section 243 states:  "<u>Issues</u> <u>that</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>raised</u> <u>in</u>
<u>pre-proclamation</u> <u>controversy</u>.  The following shall be proper issues that may be issued in a
pre-proclamation controversy:</p>

<p class="2Q">(a)  Illegal composition or
proceedings of the board of canvassers;</p>

<p class="2Q">(b)  The canvassed election
returns are incomplete, contain material defects, appear to be tampered with or
falsified, or contain discrepancies in the same returns or in other authentic
copies thereof as mentioned in <u>Sections</u> <u>233,</u> <u>234</u>, <u>234</u>
<u>and</u> <u>236</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>Code</u>; (Underscoring
supplied)</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY">Consequently, since for purposes of elections, no
pre-proclamation case is allowed against, among others, a candidate of the
House of Representatives as stated in Section 15 of Republic Act No. 7166,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion when it issued its June 2, 1992 order
suspending the proclamation of the winner of the congressional seat of the
second district of Northern Samar and in ordering a recount of precincts 7 and
16 through a resolution dated June 13, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's reliance on the <u>Lim</u> <u>v.</u> <u>COMELEC</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
case, where we held that not all pre-proclamation issues are barred by Section
15 of Republic Act No. 7166, must similarly fail because in that case,
petitioner Lim questioned the illegal composition of the Municipal Board of
Canvassers and the irregular appointment of the Board of Election Inspectors, a
pre-proclamation ground which evidently has no connection with the preparation,
transmission, receipt, custody and appreciation of election returns.  As such, we ruled that the illegal
composition of the Board of Canvassers under Section 243 of the Omnibus
Election Code may still be raised under Section 15 of Republic Act No. 7166,
before either the Board of Canvassers or the COMELEC, in accordance with
Section 19 of Republic Act No. 7166.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, private respondent insists that, notwithstanding the fact
that Section 15 of Republic Act No. 7166 prohibits the filing of a
pre-proclamation case against a candidate of the House of Representatives, nonetheless,
the same Section allows the correction of "manifest errors" in the
certificate of canvass or election returns.  In the instant case, he points out that a recount should be allowed in
52 precincts for the non-crediting of "Lucero" as a result of the
disqualification of Alice Lucero from the congressional race.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such contention again hardly deserves serious consideration for
this has already been passed upon by the COMELEC when it held that the act of
the Board of Inspectors in declaring some votes as stray involves the
appreciation of ballots which is a proper subject for an election protest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the last issue, we opine that just because there has been a
recount of precinct 16 and a canvass of election returns from precinct 7 prior
to receipt of the Temporary Restraining Order by the COMELEC on June 25, 1992,
it does not mean that this petition is already moot and academic.  Private respondent must realize that when
petitioner filed his petition seeking to annul the June 2, 1992 order and the
June 13, 1992 resolution as having been issued with grave abuse of discretion,
petitioner's corresponding prayer for a temporary restraining order necessarily
sought to preserve the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">status</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">quo</span></u> between the parties before the issuance of the said
questioned order and resolution.  Petitioner could not have sought the preservation of the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>at the time the Temporary Restraining
Order was received by the COMELEC on June 25, 1992 for that would have rendered
nugatory petitioner's interest in reconvening the regular Provincial Board of
Canvassers and prevented a recount, thus skirting the procedure laid down in
the Omnibus Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">As with a preliminary injunction, a Temporary Restraining Order
seeks to preserve the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> until the merits of the case can
be heard.  To be precise, a restraining
order is an order to maintain the subject of controversy in <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>
until the hearing of an application for a temporary injunction can be
held.  It seeks to suspend proceedings
until there can be an opportunity to inquire into the feasibility of issuing an
injunction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>Status</u> <u>quo</u> is defined as the last actual peaceable uncontested
status which preceded the pending case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case at bar, had COMELEC not issued its erroneous order of June 2, 1992 and
its resolution dated June 13, 1992, this petition would not have been filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that supervening events have transpired after the
issuance of the June 2, 1992 order does not make such order a <u>fait</u> <u>accompli</u>
since the same constitutes a continuing prohibition on the regular Provincial
Board of Canvassers of Northern Samar from reconvening until further orders
from the COMELEC.  As such, petitioner
is justified in seeking a writ of preliminary injunction under Section 3,
paragraph 1 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is GRANTED
and a writ of preliminary injunction is hereby ISSUED directing the COMELEC to
CEASE and DESIST from implementing its order of June 2, 1992 and its resolution
dated June 13, 1992 and the same are hereby declared NULLIFIED.  Consequently, the election returns based on
the recounted ballots from precinct 16 are hereby DISCARDED and in lieu
thereof, authentic returns from said precinct should instead be made the basis
for the canvassing.  The Provincial Board
of Canvassers of Northern Samar is hereby directed to PROCEED WITH DISPATCH in
the canvassing of ballots until completed and to PROCLAIM the duly elected
winner of the congressional seat for the Second District of Northern Samar.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FELICIANO,<i> J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result reached by my distinguished colleague Mme.
Justice Romero, and rest this concurrence on the ground, explicitly relied upon
by her, that the questions dealt with by public respondent Commission on
Elections in its Order of 2 June 1992 and its Resolution dated 13 June 1992 are
pre-proclamation controversies which controversies were, however, disallowed in
respect of the 11 May 1992 elections for, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, members of
the House of Representatives by Section 15 of R.A. No. 7166.  At the same time, I respectfully dissent
from the opinion of the majority to the extent that such opinion rests upon the
majority resolution in <u>Sarmiento v. Comelec</u>, G.R. No. 105628 and other
companion cases all promulgated on 6 August 1992, upon the grounds elaborated
in my dissenting opinion in <u>Sarmiento</u> and related cases.  It appears to me that there is no real need
to rely upon the <u>Sarmiento</u> case considering that the other ground relied
upon by Romero, <u>J</u>. is quite adequate to sustain the conclusion arrived
at.</p>
