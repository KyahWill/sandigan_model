				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is not unusual in rape cases for the accused to claim that he
and the complainant are sweethearts and that their carnal conversation was not
a violent intrusion but a consensual act of love.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a defense was pleaded in the case at
bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, however, a rather
intriguing variation of this defense in this case that makes the herein
accused-appellant, if he is to be believed, a distinctive lover, indeed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We shall come to that later.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant was at the time of the alleged offense <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>26-year old widower who was working <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>driver for the bishop of the Philippine
Independent Church, of which the complainant was a member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Susan <span class="SpellE">Sabuero</span> was
then seventeen years old and a third year high school student in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, where the rape was supposedly committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This incident happened, according to the prosecution, on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1974</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mencape</span>, in <span class="SpellE">Sugbongcogon</span>, of the said province.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span>
had earlier fetched Rosita <span class="SpellE">Sabuero</span> to see one Mother <span class="SpellE">Roning</span> <span class="SpellE">Llegis</span>, a superior of the
church, and Susan had come along in the belief that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">too was </span>needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> was driving the bishop's jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving at their destination, Rosita
alighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Susan could not follow,
however, because <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> abruptly closed the door of
the jeep and sped away with her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As recounted by Susan, <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> told
her they had to get something from the convent but when she saw they were going
the wrong way she shouted for help and tried to jump off the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> pulled her
down, tearing the back of her dress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
then drove to a secluded bushy place where he started forcing his attentions on
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she resisted at first and
slapped him when he began kissing her but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">became
</span>frightened when he threatened her life with a dagger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt its cold steel on her arm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the end, although she tried her best to
foil his attempts, he succeeded in violating her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She recovered from a fainting spell to find
her maidenhood bleeding and painful and still <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">bared after the just-accomplished penetration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She sat up and started crying and <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> comforted her, assuring her he would marry
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he warned her not to tell
anybody about the incident or he would kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They thereafter drove back and on the way met
Rosita and two of <span class="SpellE">Mancilla's</span> friends, who all rode in
the back of the jeep.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Susan said nothing as they drove to the convent, where they
alighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She walked fast to her house
nearby with her panty clutched in her hand and immediately reported the assault
upon her to her family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mother and
Rosita forthwith brought her to her uncle, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Gailaman</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>municipal councilor, who
accompanied them to the police chief, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borres</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On his
advice, she submitted to a medical examination, which was performed the same
night by Dr. Leon <span class="SpellE">Llanto</span>, Jr., who found fresh lacerations
in the girl's hymen and semen in her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the examination, Susan returned to the office of <span class="SpellE">Borres</span>, who took down her statement, which she completed
and signed the following day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of her complaint and after preliminary investigation
had been formally waived by the accused, <span class="GramE">an information</span>
for rape was filed against Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> on <st1:date year="1976" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Following the trial, Judge <span class="SpellE">Eulalio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span> of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental rendered a
decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1976</st1:date>,
finding the accused guilty and sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
plus civil indemnity in the sum of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
color:windowtext">P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and the costs.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> It is this decision we </span>are now asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to reverse on the ground that it is not
conformable to the established evidence and the constitutional presumption of
innocence.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier <span class="GramE">suggested,</span> the crux of <span class="SpellE">Mancilla's</span> defense is that he and Susan were sweethearts
and had mutually consented to their embrace of love.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he had driven her toward
the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">sitio</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>and started kissing her on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">way </span>but she had stopped him because
she said there was a house nearby and they might be seen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is why, he said, he drove to the
secluded spot, which was more agreeable to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There she willingly gave herself to him despite the discomfiture of
their contortions on the front seat of the jeep.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Susan denied they were lovers and did so consistently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No evidence of such relationship was ever
presented by the defense except <span class="SpellE">Mancilla's</span> own
self-serving testimony of how he had wooed and won the girl.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both parties agreed that they had met each
other for the first time only the day before, that is, <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> insisted
that Susan had gone on a swimming picnic on that date with a group that
included himself,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
but Susan's teacher, <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> <span class="SpellE">Santillan</span>,
testified that on the day and time Susan was supposed to be enjoying the
outing, she was actually taking a test in school.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
At any rate, <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> declared that it was on that
first day that he announced his love for Susan and that he reiterated this
sentiment to her in the afternoon of the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was when the girl finally accepted him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, they were already affianced when they drove in the jeep to the secluded
place where they consummated their love.</p>

<p class="BODY">To hear <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> speak, one would
suppose he is a homegrown Casanova with perhaps even a more impressive track
record than the notorious original.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
would be what is known as a fast worker with a special appeal that will make
the ladies fall in line for the privilege of swooning over him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Susan, he said, it took him
about forty minutes to win her although, concededly, he had proposed her the
day before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a girl, he
recalled, a Miss <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>, who accepted his love
after less than fifteen minutes of courtship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His wife took a little longer; three days elapsed before she confessed
that she was also smitten by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus
he declared modestly:</p>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>These
four (4) women accepted your love before your wife, you easily got them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Your love here was easily accepted before
your wife?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They liked me so much.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They accepted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">me.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Q
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">It did not even take you a day to convince them who accepted your love
each one of them?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Yes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I even courted one and she
accepted me less than fifteen (15) minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She is Miss <span class="SpellE">Cartagena</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Q
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>Among those women you courted
including your wife, you find Susan too difficult to win your love and it
almost took you forty (40) minutes to win her love?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My </span>wife, I had also a hard time
courting my wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She accepted in three
(3) days courting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>You
also found Susan difficult?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not so difficult.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not so hard because she accepted me not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span>a long time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His romance with Susan, if true, must have been as brief <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>their courtship for she was already
charging him with rape only a few hours after he claimed she accepted him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is true, as he averred, that she was
afraid he would not marry her after their sexual encounter, one may wonder why
his subsequent offers of marriage - made several times through <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>intermediaries - were repeatedly
rejected by his supposed betrothed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
His tale of Susan attending the picnic has already been established as false by
the evidence of her teacher's attendance report.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
As for his vaunted record with the girls, the trial judge, who had the
opportunity of observing him, was presumably not impressed by his looks or
style as to accept his testimony at face value.</p>

<p class="BODY">And there is still another part of his testimony that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>hard to accept, to wit, his
assertion that Susan was wearing shorts at the time of the incident and <u>nothing
underneath</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It is inconceivable that a girl wearing shorts - and a <span class="SpellE"><u>provinciana</u></span>
at that - will not wear a panty underneath unless she is a complete
wanton.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ever sophisticated city girls
are not that reckless (not that this Court pretends to be an authority on this
delicate subject).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, Susan's
torn panty was offered as an exhibit<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
to belie <span class="SpellE">Mancilla's</span> improbable declaration that when
he pulled down Susan's shorts there was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>immediately
exposed to him her lascivious invitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense put the complainant through a very rigorous
cross-examination in an attempt to enmesh her it contradictions about how the
rape <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was committed, </span>suggesting
it could not have been perpetrated if she had offered enough resistance - or at
least <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prevention - </span>considering
the cramped space where she and <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> were
supposedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">grappling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were indeed some inconsistencies in her
</span>declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are
understandable, however, if it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>considered
that one cannot expect a rape victim to remember every ugly detail of her
traumatic experience, especially so since she might in fact be trying <u>not</u>
to remember them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere circumstance
that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>testifying in the
presence of strangers on an intimate matter not usually even mentioned in
public might have caused her not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
little </span>embarrassment and confusion that rendered her narration less than
perfect.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the view of the Court, the weakest evidence presented by the
prosecution was the testimony of Rosita <span class="SpellE">Sabuero</span>,
whose conduct after <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mancilla</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>sped away in the jeep with <span class="GramE">Susan</span> is hardly understandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> was
practically a stranger to Susan, having been introduced to her only the day
before, yet Rosita did not seem disturbed when he just rode away with her niece
that night without any explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rosita did not chase them or at least demand where they were going.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she was alarmed but she nevertheless
went up <span class="SpellE">Roning's</span> house without mentioning the
incident to her and even accepted the latter's offer of peanuts which she ate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The municipal building was only a block away from <span class="SpellE">Roning's</span>
house, but it never occurred to Rosita to seek the help of the police in
looking for the apparently abducted Susan.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
And later, when <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span> and Susan reappeared, Rosita
said nothing although she noticed that her niece was unusually quiet.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But Rosita's conduct, as inexplicable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>it might be, should not detract from the truthfulness of
Susan's own direct account of <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Lucida Sans Unicode&quot;">how
she was violated by the </span>accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If Rosita was irrational, that did not make
Susan equally so; the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> reactions were hers
alone and did not reflect on the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, <span class="SpellE">Mancilla's</span> own declarations are
hardly credible either, less <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">so </span>indeed
than Rosita's.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the accused-appellant has not succeeded in refuting are the
physical fact of Susan's defilement and her sworn statement that it was he who
had forced himself on her, threatening her with a dagger all the while.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This should also explain the lack of bruises
or other marks of violence on her body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His prowess as a Don Juan, even if true, nevertheless did not work on
Susan, making it necessary to intimidate her with the weapon to gratify his
lust.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was lust, indeed, not love,
that pierced the hymeneal shield and bled it, leaving the girl in tears of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pain and revulsion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also notes the meaningful circumstance that almost
immediately after the sexual encounter, Susan reported it to her family and
thereafter lost no time in complaining to the authorities and submitting to an
embarrassing medical examination to prove her charge against <span class="SpellE">Mancilla</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
hardly the conduct of a young woman <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who
</span>has just been transported with ecstasy in the discovery of the pain and
the sweetness and the promise of a portal that is opened to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>tremblingly anticipated guest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>no doubt that the girl <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>ravished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Susan deflowered was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>girl desecrated, not a virgin <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">fulfilled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is convinced that the accused-appellant did commit the
rape upon the complainant under the circumstances narrated by the
prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For his outrage of the
maiden's virtue, he deserves the penalty imposed on him by law and the deep
disgust of all decent persons who value the chastity of women and the purity of
love.</p>
