commonly named as 'BAROG' did, then and there, willfully, unlawfully and

<p class="BODY">Upon being arraigned, Victor Asibar y Baluyot entered a plea of
guilty, while Julio Manzano y Roldan pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, mindful of the doctrines laid down by this Court
and considering the fact that there is no law prohibiting the taking of
testimony after a plea of guilty, where a grave offense is charged, reserved
its decision on the plea of guilty of Victor Asibar y Baluyot and held trial on
the merits.</p>

as the two (2) accused, following which, on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1973</st1:date>, it rendered its decision, the dispos­itive
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1. Accused Victor Asibar y Baluyot is hereby found GUILTY beyond
reasonable doubt as principal by direct participation of the crime of Robbery
with Homicide and there being proved the mitigating circumstance of plea of
guilty, offset, however, by the aggravating cir­cumstances of treachery,
recidivism and in an uninhabited place, the Court sentences him to DEATH;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

reasonable doubt as principal by cooperation of the crime of Robbery with
Homicide, with the aggravating circumstances of recidivism, treachery and in an
uninhabited place, without any mitigating circumstance to offset the same, the
Court sentences him to LIFE IMPRISONMENT.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

indemnify the heirs of the deceased Cesar Malabanan in the sum of P12,000.00
for the death of the latter; the sum of P10,000.00 by way of moral damages; the
sum of P10,000.00 by way of exemplary damages, and to return to the heirs of
Cesar Malabanan the unrecovered articles and cash money taken from the said
victim or to jointly and severally indemnify them in the amount representing
the value thereof which is P11,255.00, if they fail to do so and to pay the
costs.</blockquote>

P400.00 as counsel de oficio of both accused." <span class="GramE">(pp.

<p class="BODY">WE quote the evidence of the prosecution from the brief of the
Solicitor General, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused Victor Asibar y Baluyot was committed to the Bureau
of Prisons on November 6, 1970 after he was convicted for the crime of Homicide
by the Court of First Instance of Zambales (Exhibit 'A') (p. 12, tsn., Nov. 6,
1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While serving sentence in
Muntinglupa, he came to know accused Julio Manzano y Roldan who was serving
sentence for Theft of Large Cattle (p. 2, tsn, Nov. 9, 1972; pp. 8-9, tsn, Dec.
20, 1972; p. 22, tsn, Dec. 21, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1971</st1:date>,
accused Asibar was transferred to the Sablayan Penal Colony from where he
escaped on <st1:date year="1972" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1972</st1:date>
(pp. 11-12, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="11">Nov. 6, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, accused Julio Manzano y
Roldan was released on parole on February 25, 1971 (Exhibit 'B') (p. 14, tsn,
Nov. 6, 1972; p. 21, tsn, Dec. 21, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under the terms of his parole, he was to report to the Municipal Judge
of Puerto Galera, Oriental Mindoro where he resided (p. 15, tsn, Nov. 6, 1972)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While riding in a Bureau of Prisons' truck coming from
Sablayan going to Mamburao while still a detainee at the Sablayan Penal Colony,
Asibar met along the way his co-accused Manzano (pp. 3-4, tsn, Nov. 9, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After accused Asibar escaped in February 1972
from the Sablayan Penal Colony, he went to the house of accused Manzano at
Lusacan and stayed there (pp. 6-7, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After about a week he was asked to leave after confiding to Manzano and
his wife that he was an escapee (pp. 7-8, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Asibar was employed as a farm laborer by a certain
Bienvenido Rodriguez of Sta. Cruz, Occidental Mindoro (pp. 10-11, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1972</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While working as laborer in Sta. Cruz, accused Asibar saw the
deceased Cesar Malabanan, when he was still alive, as the latter passed by Sta.
Cruz and he was pointed out to Asibar by the latter's friends (p. 11, tsn, Dec.
20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, Asibar used to pass
along the <st1:place><st1:placename>Pola</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
bed in going to his place of work and many times he saw Cesar Malabanan pass
the same place riding in his jeep and in possession of several firearms which
he became interested to possess (p. 28, tsn, Nov. 7, 1972; pp. 11, 18, tsn,
Dec. 20, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1972</st1:date>,
the two accused waited for deceased Malabanan along the dried river bed of <st1:place><st1:placename>Pola</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> (pp. 21-24, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="11">Nov. 8, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">At about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="13"><span class="GramE">1:00 o'clock p.m.</span></st1:time><span class="GramE">, the deceased passed by (pp. 11-12, 18, tsn, </span><st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12"><span class="GramE">Dec. 20, 1972</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused Asibar was
then hiding behind a cluster of talahib grass while accused Manzano stood about
one hundred (100) yards away at an elevated place to watch for the approach of
the victim and then signal Asibar (pp. 23-24, tsn, Nov. 8, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the jeep of the victim approached,
Manzano signalled Asibar who positioned himself and got ready to shoot the
victim (pp. 26-27, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">Nov. 7, 1972</st1:date>;
pp. 13-15, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1972</st1:date>;
pp. 17-18, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the jeep of the victim was about twenty
(20) meters away from him and it stopped apparently because of engine trouble,
the victim alighted and began tinkering with something in its engine (p. 14,
tsn, Dec. 20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asibar then fired
his first shot (p. 15, tsn, Dec. 20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The victim made several steps forward in his direction but later
retreated to a distance of about ten (10) meters, apparently to return to his
jeep (p. 15, tsn, Dec. 20, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, Asibar fired a second shot and the victim
fell (p. 15, tsn, Dec. 20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
said accused was certain that the victim was already dying, he got the victim's
money from the latter's jacket in the amount of P1,000, more or less, and gave
to accused Manzano the sum of P395.00 (Exhibit 'N') as the latter's share (pp.
12-13, tsn, Dec. 20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Manzano and
Asibar likewise got from the deceased three (3) firearms, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>one (1) carbin (Exhibit 'L'), one (1) pistol
caliber 45 (Exhibit 'R'), one (1) revolver, magnum caliber 22 (Exhibit 'V'),
one (1) attache case (Exhibit 'M') (pp. 33-34, tsn, Nov. 8, 1972; pp. 10-11,
19-20, tsn, December 11, 1972; pp. 12-13, 16-17, tsn, December 20, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After accused had taken the aforesaid
articles from the victim, Asibar proceeded to a nearby forested area and at a
banana plantation where he forced open the attache case (Exhibit 'M') and got
therefrom two bundles of money and other documents (pp. 26-27, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="12">Dec. 20, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Vicente A. Hernandez, Assistant Provincial Health Officer
of Occidental Mindoro, performed the autopsy of deceased Cesar Malabanan and
issued the correspond­ing Death Certificate (Exhibit 'C', p. 7, Record),
simultaneously with the records of the autopsy (Exhibit 'P') and the
accompanying diagram to said autopsy report (Exhibit 'D-1', pp. 8-10,
Record).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found nine (9) gunshot
wounds on the deceased, three of which were on the head and six (6) on the
thorax (pp. 25-26, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="11">Nov. 6, 1972</st1:date>;
Exhibit 'D-1').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of his
autopsy of the victim he recovered three (3) pellets, one (1) from the head and
two (2) from the thorax, which he thenceforth kept in a small bottle (Exhibit
'E'; pp. 22-23, tsn, Nov. 6, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the gunshot wounds on the head were sustained by the victim, he must have been
on a stooping position while the assailant faced the victim with a distance of
more than five (5) meters between them (pp. 23-25, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="11">Nov. 6, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The six (6) gunshot wounds on the thorax of the victim were caused by
pellets and when said six (6) gunshot wounds were sustained by the victim,
assailant must have been five (5) meters behind, the 'point of entrance' being
at back of the victim (pp. 29-30, tsn, Nov. 6, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The injuries sustained by the victim on the head were fatal
and, taken independ­ently, could have caused the death of the victim (pp.
32-33, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="11">Nov. 6, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the six (6) gunshot wounds on the
thorax are also fatal and if such were the only injuries sustained by the
victim, they could have caused his death just as well (pp. 33-34, tsn, Nov. 6,
1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said injuries sustained by
the victim were caused by a Gauge 12 shotgun and during the autopsy, Dr.
Hernandez recovered about 300 cc. of blood causing severe damage on the brain
of the victim and the cause of death of victim Cesar Malabanan was hemorrhage,
internal, severe secondary to gunshot wounds, multiple (pp. 26, 28, 33, tsn,
Nov. 6, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the time of his death, the deceased Cesar Malabanan had
with him P7,000.00 to pay the wages of workers in his poultry and defray
expenses for necessary supplies and materials in the operation of the same
project, as well as three (3) firearms (Cal. 45 pistol, Cal. 30 carbine and
Cal. 22 magnum) all licensed in his name, and his attache case (pp. 19-20,
21-23, tsn, Nov. 9, 1972; p. 5, tsn, December 19, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also wore his diamond ring (Solitaire
brillante) valued at P6,500.00, a jade ring valued at P250.00, a sunglass
valued at P200.00 and a box of live ammunitions (pp. 30-31, tsn, Nov. 9, 1972;
pp. 9-11, tsn, Dec. 19,1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the
lifetime of deceased Malabanan he was employed in the License Division, Office
of the City Treasurer, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, with
the salary of P650.00 monthly (p. 18, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because of the gravity of the offense and the manner it was
perpetrated, a PC Team of investigators headed by T/Sgt. Victor Ona and Senior
NBI Agents Zacarias R. Leus and Juanito Gonzaga of the National Bureau of
Investigation were assigned to assist the local police authorities of Mamburao,
Occidental Mindoro (pp. 3-5, 43-44, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1972</st1:date>,

co-soldiers, Manzano accompanied them to the poblacion of Sta. Cruz where
Victor Asibar was arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From Asibar
were recovered two firearms, caliber 45 <span class="GramE">pistol</span>
(Exhibit 'R') with magazines and live bullets (Exhibits 'R-1' and 'R-2') and
caliber 22 revolver Magnum (Exhibit 'V') with holster (Exh. <span class="GramE">'V-1')

house of accused Manzano where they met Manzano's wife who, upon being
interrogated, refused to inform that the money was in their possession (pp. 48,
tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">Nov. 7, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, her eight year old son, who was then
present, readily pointed to the money which was hidden at their backyard inside
the trunk of a tree (pp. 46-47, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">Nov.
 7, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told the inves­tigators
that said money was given by his father (pp. 46-47, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The money (Exh.</span> 'N')
recovered which was wrapped in cellophane amounted to P395.00 in 5-peso and
20-peso bill denominations which Sgt. Ona entrusted to Fiscal Malabanan,
brother of the deceased (pp. 49-50, tsn, November 7, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the same backyard of Manzano they likewise recovered a
carbine (Exhibit 'L') underneath dried leaves and a small log (pp. 51-52, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">Nov. 7, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the accused Manzano himself who
pointed to the said hiding place (p. 52, tsn, Nov. 7, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon recovery of Exhibit 'L' (carbine) T/Sgt.
Ona confronted Manzano who admitted that it was given to him by accused Asibar
(p. 52, tsn, Nov. 7, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 'L'
was identified by Asibar to be the same carbine he got from the deceased after
he had killed him and which he subsequently gave to Manzano (pp. 51­-54, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">Nov. 7, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The serial number of said carbine, No.
7203022, tallied with the serial number appearing on the License to Possess
(Exhibit 'Q') in the name of the deceased (p. 54, tsn, Nov. 7, 1972).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both accused admitted that the articles and items recovered
and identified by them were taken by Asibar from the deceased at the crime
scene (pp. 4-5, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="11">Nov. 8, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While they were recovering said articles,
Sgt. Ona asked accused Asibar where he hid the attache case and other firearms
as well as the firearm he used in shooting the victim (p. 5, tsn, Nov. 8,
1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asibar pointed to the general

Sitio Baribuan, Barrio Barahan, Sta. Cruz, Occidental Mindoro (p. 5, tsn,

companions with both accused repaired to the place indicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After they had travelled less than half a
kilometer, they were led by Asibar to a forested area nearby where, underneath
banana leaves, Asibar himself recovered the attache case (Exhibit 'M') which he
admitted was the one he took from the deceased (pp. 6-7, 9-10, tsn, Nov. 8,
1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Ona asked Asibar for the
firearm which he used in shooting the deceased and Asibar led them to a
forested area about 700 yards from the place where the attache case was
recovered and in their presence accused Asibar re­covered the homemade shotgun
(Exhibit 'F') which he used in shooting the deceased together with twenty-one
(21) rounds of live ammunitions, Gauge 12 (Exhibits 'F-2' to 'F-22').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asibar informed them further that said shot
gun was given to him by Manzano (pp. 26-27, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1972</st1:date>; pp. 11-12, tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="11">Nov. 8, 1972</st1:date>).</blockquote>

about 10 yards away from the scene of the crime was noted as slightly bent
indicating that somebody had stepped on it (pp. 19-20, tsn, Nov. 8, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there was a foot print (pp. 18-20,
tsn, <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="11">Nov. 8, 1972</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asibar admitted during the confrontation and
re-­enactment of the crime that he stayed at the place where the talahib growth
was slightly bent and that his companion was Julio Manzano who was at an
elevated place on the other side of the river about 100 yards away opposite him
(Asibar) to watch for the arrival of the victim and to make the necessary
signal to Asibar (pp. 21-24, tsn, Nov. 8, 1972).</blockquote>

T/Sgt. Ona and his group of investigators and the NBI Agents went to the crime
scene for the second time for the re-enactment of the crime (p. 6, tsn, Nov. 9,

accused (p. 6, tsn, Nov. 9, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY">On December 11, 1978, the Clerk of Court of this Court received a

informing "the death of Prisoner JULIO MANZANO y ROLDAN, No. 10676-D,

this Court issued a resolution requiring the Solicitor General to comment on
the letter of Mr. Rosales within ten (10) days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1979</st1:date>,
Acting Solicitor General Ramon A. Barcelona and Solicitor Crescencia A.
Caparroso-Salva submitted their comment, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1. The Solicitor General was also furnished copy of the
abovementioned letter dated December 1, 1978 of the Officer-in-Charge of the
Bureau of Prisons together with a copy of the death certificate of Julio R.

respect to him should be dismissed without prejudice to the civil liability, if
any, in favor of the aggrieved parties (Supreme Court Resolution dated June 9,
1978 in People vs. Florencio Datay alias 'Lucy', L-39976; Supreme Court
Resolution dated July 25, 1978 in People vs. Valentino S. Estrella,
L-32706)."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1979</st1:date>,
this Court issued a resolution "dismissing the case against appellant
Julio R. Manzano insofar as his criminal liability is concerned, Barredo J.
voted to dismiss the case against aforesaid appellant <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>."
On the same day, judgment was entered as final and executory with respect to
said Julio R. Manzano.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, defense counsel alleged that the trial court erred
(1) in appreciating the aggravating circumstances of recidivism and uninhabited
place in imposing the supreme penalty of death on accused-appellant Victor Asibar;
(2) in not holding that accused-appellant Julio Manzano's extrajudicial
confession (Exh. J) should be rejected for having been obtained under
circumstances amounting to force and intimidation; (3) in holding that
accused-appellant Julio Manzano acted in conspiracy with accused-appellant
Victor Asibar; and (4) in not holding that accused-appellant Julio Manzano
should be acquitted for lack of proof to show any criminal participation on his
part, be it as principal, accomplice or accessory, in the commission of the
crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the case against Julio Manzano y Roldan has
already been dismissed, WE will take up the issues raised with respect to
Victor Asibar y Baluyot only, on the presence of the aggravating circumstances
of recidivism and uninhabited place.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to recidivism, the Solicitor General, in his brief,
agrees and to this WE approve that since the previous conviction of appellant
Asibar for homicide under Article 249 falls under Title VIII of the Revised
Penal Code, entitled "Crimes against Persons," and the case at bar
for Robbery with Homicide under Article 294, paragraph I of the Revised Penal
Code, falls under Title X, entitled "Crimes against Property,"
recidivism should not have been considered in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A recidivist is one who, at the time of his
trial for one crime, shall have been previously convicted by final judgment of
another crime embraced in the same title of this Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is one of the requisites of recidivism
that both the first and second offenses are embraced in the same title of the
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of an uninhabited place must be
taken into account, considering the testimony of Sgt. Laureano Descanso that
he, together with Sgt. Ona, two NBI agents, Sgt. Lamuzga and CIC Sgt. Luna,
went to the scene of the crime and found that there were no houses thereat or
that the houses were very far from the place; or that the nearest house was
more or less one (1) kilometer away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
uninhabited place is one where there are no houses at all, a place at a
considerable distance from the town, or where the houses are scattered at a
great distance from each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Reyes,
Revised Penal Code, 1974, Book I, p.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>318).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People vs.
Aguinaldo, 55 Phil. 610, it was held that where the nearest house was 400
meters distant, hidden by coconut groves, the place was considered <u>despoblado</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in People vs. Rubia, 52 Phil. 172, this
Court held that the crime was committed in an uninhabited place because it was
difficult for the offended party to receive any help, while the assailants
could easily have escaped punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime being robbery with homicide, treachery (since the
attack was sudden and victim was not given the chance to defend himself) should
be considered as a generic aggravating circumstance, and not a qualifying
one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, with the presence of two
aggravating circum­stances, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>treachery and uninhabited place, and one mitigating circumstance, which
is the plea of <span class="GramE">guilty,</span> the penalty should be imposed
in its maximum period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, for lack
of the necessary votes, the extreme penalty of death cannot be imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court with respect to
Victor Asibar y Baluyot is AFFIRMED in all respects with the sole modification
that the appellant shall suffer <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs de oficio.</span></p>
