case, which started out as an ordinary complaint for a sum of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question squarely presented to the Court
is the validity of the memorandum decision authorized under Section 40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 in the light of Article VIII, Section 14 of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioner leased his apartment in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>

representing the rental for the additional ten days of his occupancy after the
expiration of the lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
rejected this request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said the
lessee still owed him for other charges, including the electricity and water

<p class="BODY">The private respondent sued in the Metropolitan Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the

 14, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was done in a
memorandum decision reading in full as follows:</p>

He is now before us to fault the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">court, principally for sustaining the memorandum decision of the
regional trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His contention is
that it violates Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This provision reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 14.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein
clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">it is based.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>No petition for review or motion for reconsideration of a decision
of the court shall be refused due course or denied without stating the legal
basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Except for the second paragraph, which was introduced only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the present charter, Section 14 has
been i<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">n force since the Constitution of
1935.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision was recast in
affirmative terms in the 1973 Constitution but has been virtually restored to
its original form <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in the </span>Constitution
of 1987, to apply to all courts, including the municipal courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose has always been the same, <u>viz</u>.,
to inform the person reading the decision, and especially the parties, of how
it was reached by the court after consideration of the pertinent facts and
examination of the applicable laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The parties are entitled to no less than this explanation if only
to assure them that the court rendering the decision actually studied the case
before pronouncing its judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
there are more substantial reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
one thing, the losing party must be given an opportunity to analyze the
decision so that, if permitted, he may elevate what he may consider its errors
for review by a higher tribunal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
another, the decision, if well-presented and reasoned, may convince the losing
party of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">merits </span>and persuade
it to accept the verdict in good grace instead of prolonging the litigation
with a useless appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A third reason is
that decisions with a full exposition of the facts and the law on which they
are based, especially those coming from the Supreme Court, will constitute a
valuable<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> body of case law that can
serve as useful references and even as precedents in the resolution of future
controversies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Court said in
Rosales v. Court of First Instance:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

pronouncements represent the wisdom of the past.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are the voice of vanished judges talking
to the future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except where there </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Section 40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 reads <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 40.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>Form of decision in appealed cases</u>. - Every decision or final
resolution of a court in appealed cases shall clearly and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>distinctly state the findings of fact

decision or final resolution itself, or adopted by reference from those set forth
in the decision, order or resolution appealed from.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above section was applied in the Romero case, together with a
similar rule embodied in Section 18 of P.D. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">No. 946, providing that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>All cases of the Court of Agrarian Relations now pending before the
Court of Appeals shall remain in the Division to which they have been assigned,
and shall be decided within sixty (60) days from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this Decree; Provided, however, That
if the decision or order be an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
conclusion of the judgment appealed from, then the Court of Appeals may,
instead of rendering an extended opinion, indicate clearly the trial court's
findings of fact and pronouncements of law which have been adopted as basis for
the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left:.3in">In the said case, Justice Jose Y. <span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, speaking for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">a
</span>unanimous Court, declared:</p>

<blockquote>As previously stated, the decision of the Court of Agrarian
Relations consisted of thirteen pages, single space.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The above-quoted decision of the respondent
Court of Appeals consists of four pages, three of which contains verbatim the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision appealed from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining page is devoted to an
explanation of why "for judicial convenience and expediency, therefore, We
hereby adopt, by way of reference, the findings of facts and conclusions of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> spread in its decision, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>integral part of this Our decision." The said decision
may be considered as substantial compliance with the above-quoted provisions in
Section 18 of P.D. No. 946 and Section 40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
129.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, he was quick to add a tenable misgiving and to
express the following reservation:</p>

<blockquote>The authority given the appellate court to adopt by reference the
findings of fact and conclusions of law from those set forth in the appealed
decisions should be exercised with caution and prudence, because the tendency
would be to follow the line of least resistance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">by just adopting the findings and conclusions of the lower court
without thoroughly studying the appealed case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This <u>caveat</u> was necessary because, as he correctly
observed:</p>

<blockquote>It cannot be too strongly emphasized that just as important as the
intrinsic validity of a decision is the perception by the parties-litigants that
they have been accorded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>fair
opportunity to be heard by a fair and responsible magistrate before judgment is
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is this perception, coupled with a clear
conscience, which enables the members of the judiciary to discharge the awesome
responsibility of sitting in judgment on their fellowmen.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">question </span>that
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>purpose of the law in
authorizing the memorandum decision is to expedite the termination of
litigations for the benefit of the parties as well as the courts themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerned with the mounting problem of delay in the
administration of justice, the Constitution now contains a number of provisions
aimed at correcting this serious difficulty that has caused much disaffection
among the people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">16 </span>of the Bill of Rights reiterates <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the original provision in the 1973
Constitution guaranteeing to all persons "the right to a speedy
disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial or
administrative bodies." Section 14(2) of the same Article III retains the rule
that the accused shall be entitled to a trial that shall not only be public and
impartial but also </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">speedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Article </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">VIII, Section 5(3), the Supreme Court is expressly permitted to
temporarily assign a judge from one station to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">another when the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public
interest so requires, as when there is a necessity for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">less occupied judge to help a busier
colleague dispose of his cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
paragraph 5 of the same section, it is stressed that the rules of court to be
promulgated by the Supreme Court "shall provide a </span>simplified and
inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases." In Section 15
of the same article, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">maximum periods
are prescribed for the decision or resolution of cases, to wit, twenty-four
months in the case of Supreme Court and, unless reduced by the Supreme Court,
twelve months for all lower collegiate courts and three months for all other
lower courts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The courts of justice are really hard put at coping with the
tremendous number of cases in their dockets which, to make matters worse, continues
to grow by the day despite the efforts being taken to reduce it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the Supreme Court alone, an average of 400
cases is received every month as against the average of 300 cases disposed of
during the same month, leaving a difference of 100 cases monthly that is added
to some 5,000 still unresolved cases that have accumulated during the last two
decades or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>At <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">this </span>rate, the backlog will increase
by 1,200 cases every year on top of the earlier balance, much of which, despite
its age, is still viable and have still to be resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the Court spends four days
of the week for studying and deliberating on these cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>its <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and
division sessions, one can appreciate the limited time allowed its members for
the actual writing of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(This particular decision, while extended,
happens fortunately to be less complicated than many of the other cases
submitted to it, which require more time to write, not to mention the
antecedent research that may have to be made.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in the light of these practical considerations, the
memorandum decision can be welcomed indeed as an acceptable method of dealing
expeditiously with the case load of the courts of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But expediency alone, no matter how
compelling, cannot excuse non-compliance with the Constitution; or to put it
more familiarly, the end does not justify the means.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plain
that if Section 40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 is
unconstitutional, it must be struck down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, we find that a judgment was made by the
metropolitan trial court in compliance with the rule on summary procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision consisted of three typewritten
pages, single space, and stated clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on
which it was based.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a concise and
well-written decision, and a correct one to boot, for which Judge <span class="SpellE">Paciano</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Balita</span> is to be
commended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem, though, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the petitioner sees it, is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that in affirming this judgment, the regional
trial court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> rendered a mere memorandum
decision that simply adopted by reference the findings of fact and law made by
Judge <span class="SpellE">Balita</span> and then concluded, without saying more,
that "there (was) no cogent reason to disturb the same." It is
claimed that as Judge de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> did not make his own
</span>statement of the facts and the law as required by the Constitution, his
memorandum decision was a total nullity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, when the appeal was taken to the respondent court, what it
reviewed was not the memorandum decision of the regional trial court but the
decision rendered by the metropolitan trial court which, legally <span class="GramE">speaking,</span> was not before the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not really correct to say that the Court of Appeals did not
review the memorandum decision of the regional trial court which was the
subject of the petition for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
reading of its own decision will show that it dealt extensively with the
memorandum decision and discussed it at some length in the light of the
observations - and reservations - of this Court in the Romero case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in reviewing the decision of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">metropolitan trial court, the Court of
Appeals was actually reviewing the decision of the regional trial court, which
had incorporated by reference the earlier decision rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Balita</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question, of course, is whether such incorporation by
reference was a valid act that effectively elevated the decision of the
metropolitan trial court for examination by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be fair, let it be said that when Judge de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> availed himself of the convenience offered by Section
40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, he was only acting in accordance
with the ruling announced in Romero permitting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the use of the memorandum decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must also be observed that even if the respondent court appeared to
be partial to the reservation rather than the rule in the said case, it
nevertheless had the duty - which it discharged - to abide by the doctrine
announced therein by the highest tribunal of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court could not have acted
otherwise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is not hampered by such inhibitions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we may re-examine our own rulings and
modify or reverse them whenever warranted, we take a second look at the
memorandum decision and the Romero case and test them on the touchstone of the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law does not define the memorandum decision and simply
suggests that the court may adopt by reference the findings of fact and the
conclusions of law stated in the decision, order or resolution on appeal before
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No particular form <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>prescribed; the conditions for its
use are not indicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 does not even employ the term "memorandum
decision" in Section 40 or elsewhere in the rest of the statute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This phrase appears to have been introduced
in this jurisdiction not by that law but by Section 24 of the Interim Rules and
Guidelines, reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 24.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Memorandum decisions.</u></span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>– The judgment or final resolution of a court
in appealed cases may adopt by reference the findings of fact and conclusions
of law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contained in the decision or
final order appealed from.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that where the decision of the appellate court
actually reproduces the findings of fact or the conclusions of law of the court
below, it is not a memorandum decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>envisioned in the above provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The distinctive features of the memorandum
decision are, first, it is rendered by an appellate court, and second, it
incorporates by reference the findings of fact or the conclusions of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">law </span>contained
in the decision, order or ruling under review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most likely, the purpose is to affirm the decision, although it is not
impossible that the approval of the findings of fact by the lower court may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lead to a different conclusion of law by the
higher court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the reason
for allowing the incorporation by reference is evidently to avoid the cumbersome
reproduction </span>of the decision of the lower court, or portions thereof, in
the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the higher
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The idea is to avoid having to
repeat in the body of the latter decision the findings or conclusions of the
lower court since they are being approved or adopted anyway.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the memorandum decision is also allowed in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, but its form (at least) differs from
the one under consideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a
decision is rendered in that country upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>previous determination by the judge that
there is no need for a published opinion and that it will have no <span class="SpellE">precedential</span> effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The judgment is usually limited to the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>memorandum is attached containing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>brief statement of the facts and the law
involved, mainly for the information of the parties to the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">When a law is questioned before the Court, we employ the
presumption in favor of its constitutionality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As we said in Peralta v. Commission of Elections, "to justify the
nullification of a law, there must be a ‘clear and unequivocal breach of the
Constitution, not a doubtful and argumentative implication.'"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Courts will bend over backward to sustain that presumption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of doubt, it is the duty of the
judiciary to exert every effort to prevent the invalidation of the law and the
nullification of the will of the legislature that enacted it and the executive
that approved it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This norm is based on
a becoming respect that the judiciary is expected to accord the political
departments of the government which, it must be assumed in fairness, thoroughly
studied the measure under challenge and assured themselves of its
constitutionality before agreeing to enact it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has deliberated extensively on the challenge posed
against the memorandum decision as now authorized by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Taking into account the salutary purpose for
which it is allowed, and bearing in mind the above-discussed restraint we must
observe when a law is challenged before us, we have come to the conclusion that
Section<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> </span>40 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>we shall interpret it here, is not
unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is questioned about the law is the permission it gives for
the appellate court to merely adopt by reference in its own decision the
judgment of the lower court on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is easy to understand that this device may feed the suspicion feared
by Justice <span class="SpellE">Feria</span> that the court has not given the
appeal the attention it deserved and thus deprived the parties of due
process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True or not, this impression <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>likely to undermine popular faith
in the judiciary as an impartial forum which hears before it decides and bases
its decision on the established facts and the applicable law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">No less objectionable is the inconvenience
involved in having to search for the decision referred to, which, having been incorporated
by reference only, does not have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to be
attached to the memorandum decision.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court had occasion earlier
to complain about this difficulty in the case of <span class="SpellE">Gindoy</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tapucar</span>,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> where we said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> True it
is that the Court of First Instance may adopt <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">toto</span></u></span> either expressly or
impliedly the findings and conclusions of the inferior court, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as a </span>rule, such adoption would amount
to a substantial compliance with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
constitutional mandate discussed herein, but where, as in this case, the specific
arguments presented against the decision of the inferior court are of such
nature that a blanket <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of said decision
does not in fact adequately dispose of the strictures against it, it is but
proper, if only to facilitate the action to be taken by the appellate court on
the petition for review, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the concrete bases of the impugned decision
should appear on its face, instead of the appellate court having to dig into
the records to find out how the inferior court resolved the issues of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to this problem, the Solicitor General correctly points out
that it does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not exist in </span>the
case at bar because the decision of the Court of Appeals extensively quoted
from the decision of the metropolitan trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Although
only incorporated by reference in the memorandum decision of the regional trial
court, Judge <span class="SpellE">Balita's</span> decision was nevertheless
available to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
this circumstance, or even happenstance, if you will, that has validated the
memorandum decision challenged in this case and spared it from constitutional
infirmity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That same circumstance is what will move us now to lay down the
following requirement, as a condition for the proper application of Section 40
of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">memorandum decision, to be
valid, cannot incorporate the findings of fact and the conclusions of law of
the lower court only by <u>remote</u> reference, which is to say that the
challenged decision is not easily and immediately available to the </span>person
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reading the memorandum decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the incorporation by reference to be
allowed, it must provide for <u>direct</u> access to the facts and the law
being adopted, which must be contained in </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">statement <u>attached</u> to the said decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the memorandum decision
authorized under Section 40 of B.P <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 should
actually embody the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the lower court
in an annex attached to and made an indispensable part of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is expected that this requirement will allay the suspicion
that no study was made of the decision of the lower court and that its decision
was merely affirmed without a proper examination of the facts and the law on
which it was based.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>proximity</u>
at least of the annexed statement should suggest that such an examination has
been undertaken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, of course, also
understood that the decision being adopted should, to begin with, comply with
Article VIII, Section 14 as no amount of incorporation or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">adoption will rectify its violation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds it necessary to emphasize that the memorandum
decision should be sparingly used lest it become an addictive excuse for
judicial sloth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an additional
condition for its validity that this kind of decision may be resorted to only
in cases where the facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are in the
main accepted by both parties or easily determinable by the judge and there are
no doctrinal complications involved that will require an extended discussion of
the laws involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum
decision may be employed in simple litigations only, such as ordinary
collection cases, where the appeal is obviously groundless and deserves no more
than the time needed to dismiss it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Despite the convenience afforded by the memorandum decision, it
is still desirable that the appellate judge exert some effort in restating in
his own words the findings of fact of the lower court and presenting his own
interpretation of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">law </span>instead of merely parroting the language of the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> as if he cannot do any better.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There must be less intellectual indolence and more pride of authorship
in the writing of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>decision, especially if it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">comes from an appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It ill becomes an appellate judge to write his rulings with a
pair of scissors and a pot of paste as if he were a mere researcher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is an innovator, not an echo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case usually becomes progressively
simpler as it passes through the various levels of appeal and many issues
become unimportant or moot and drop along the way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate judge should prune the
cluttered record to make the issues <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">clearer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cannot usually do this by simply mimicking
the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He must use his own
perceptiveness in unraveling the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">rollo</span></span>
and his own discernment in discovering the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No less importantly, he must use his own language in laying down his
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in doing so, he should
also guard against torpidity lest his pronouncements excite </span>no more
fascination than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>technical tract on the values of horse manure as a
fertilizer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A little style will help <span class="GramE">liven</span> the opinion trapped in the tortuous lexicon of the law
with all its <span class="SpellE">whereases</span> and wherefores.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A judicial decision does not have to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>bore.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interpretation we make today will not apply retroactively to
the memorandum decision rendered by the regional trial court in the case at
bar, or to the decision of the respondent court affirming such decision on the
strength of Romero v. Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As earlier observed, there was substantial compliance with Section 40
because of the direct availability and actual review of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">decision </span>of Judge <span class="SpellE">Balita</span>
incorporated by reference in the memorandum decision of Judge de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The memorandum
decision as then understood under the Romero decision was a valid act at the
time it was rendered by Judge de la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> and produced
binding legal effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We also affirm the
finding of the respondent court that the summary judgment without a formal
trial was in accord with the Rule on Summary Procedure and that the award of
attorney's fees is not improper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Henceforth, all memorandum decisions shall comply with the requirements
herein set forth both as to the form prescribed and the occasions when they may
be rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any deviation will summon
the strict enforcement of Article VIII, Section 14 of the Constitution and
strike down the flawed judgment as a lawless disobedience.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately
<span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is so ordered.</p>
