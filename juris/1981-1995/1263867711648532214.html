of San Vicente East, <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
a married woman and mother of three.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the basis thereof, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Jorito</span> C. Peralta of <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, filed an

<blockquote>The undersigned Assistant Provincial Fiscal, upon sworn complaint
of <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> y Mercado,
accuses DOMINADOR PARINGIT y CABIDA, alias "<span class="SpellE">Ador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paringit</span>", of the crime of RAPE, committed as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">That on or about the 15th day of October, 1985, at dawn, in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Vicente East, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
New Republic of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the above-named accused entered the dwelling place of complaining
witness <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> y
Mercado and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, have carnal knowledge
of said <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> y
Mercado, against her will.</p>

<p class="2Q">Contrary to Article 335, Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded "not guilty" during arraignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>, at or about dawn, <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>, 23 years old, was
inside her hut at San Vicente East, breastfeeding her baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from her three children, she was
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that her husband, Ricardo
<span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>, was then at San Vicente West, about 500 meters
from San Vicente East, attending a funeral wake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stated that she was lying on the floor
when she saw the accused enter the hut through an opening (what appeared to be
the hut's doorway).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also declared
that she recognized him by the light of a kerosene lamp <span class="SpellE">ensconed</span>
on a can inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, she rose and
shouted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, however, embraced
her, covered her mouth, and landed two punches on her stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed that she fell down, and that
thereafter, the accused "removed my panty and he abused me."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After that, the accused allegedly told her:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"[D]o not tell Carding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Her husband.] I will come back again."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When "Carding" returned, at or about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time>, she told him that "a certain
man abused me,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and that man was <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Paringit</span>,
the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband soon proceeded
to the house of his parents, who convinced her to leave no stone unturned in
bringing the accused to justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">eight o'clock</st1:time>,
the <span class="SpellE">Pajars</span> saw the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain of San Vicente East, who accompanied them to the police station in <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> executed a
statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they saw Judge <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Ramos of the Municipal Circuit Court of <span class="SpellE">Asingan</span>, who conducted a preliminary investigation, and who
found probable cause for rape against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">She also said that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine
 o'clock</st1:time>, she sought a medical examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> testified, in turn, that
he had come from a wake at San Vicente West, when upon returning home, her wife
broke the tragic news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, together
with his wife and parents, he went to see the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain who led them to the police headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that the accused himself was
summoned by the police and was investigated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He told the court that shortly, he took his wife to the municipal health
officer for examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">He admitted having seen the accused at the wake but contended
that the latter left at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">eleven o'clock
 P.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, he (Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>) left not until <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five
 o'clock</st1:time> the following morning (<st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, he examined Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>
on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date>
(should be <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>)
at or about <st1:time minute="45" hour="8">8:45 a.m.</st1:time>, who saw her to
complain of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His report is as

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the prosecution rested.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosquita</span>, <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, and the accused himself.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosquita</span>
testified that on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date>,
he attended a wake of Alexander <span class="SpellE">Bataen</span>, a child of a
couple-friend, <st1:city><st1:place>Salvador</st1:place></st1:city> and Norma <span class="SpellE">Bataen</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated
that he stayed there until <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time>
the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he saw
the accused there, playing poker along with <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, a certain Robert Valdez and a few
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allegedly played until <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date> after which they went home together.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Malong</span> corroborated <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rosquita's</span> testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said that from <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">ten o'clock P.M.</st1:time>
of <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date> up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> the following morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He averred that he, along with the accused, <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosquita</span>, and Robert
Valdez, left together.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused himself declared that he was at the wake from about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time> on the night of <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date> until <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he bided his time playing
poker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reached the farm where he
worked at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="6">6:30 a.m.</st1:time>, where he
chanced upon the <span class="SpellE">Pajars</span> along the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allegedly ignored one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that the offended party had merely
mistaken him for another "<span class="SpellE">Ador</span>", of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Juan, San Manuel, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise contended that at the police
headquarters, <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>
denied that it was he who raped her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense having rested, the prosecution presented a rebuttal witness,
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> Alvarado, who informed the court
that he interrogated the accused about the victim's complaint, and the victim,
who admitted meeting the accused on their way to file her accusation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1988</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered judgment, declaring the accused guilty as charged,
sentencing him to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>, and ordering
him to pay P30,000.00 in moral damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused assigns two errors allegedly committed by the trial
court, first, in not acquitting him and second, in not giving weight to his
defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">He notes:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the offended
party never mentioned the word "rape" in her recital; (2) she said
that it was her husband "Carding" who "abused" her; (3) she
did not offer a tenacious resistance in the course of the alleged rape; (4)
when the accused said "Do not tell Carding, I will come back again,"
it means that they had past sexual encounters, and the last one was voluntary;
(5) she could not have positively identified the accused as the culprit for lack
of sufficient illumination; (6) she did not confront the accused when they met
on her way to lodge a complaint; (7) she merely begrudged the accused whom she
suspected of taking her money; (8) Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> himself could not positively determine whether or
not she had been raped, or had recent sexual congress; (9) he found no sperm
cells notwithstanding the fact that the victim testified that the accused
ejaculated; (10) he found no <span class="SpellE">hematoma</span> or bruises on
any part of her body; (11) his report stated that he conducted his examination
on October 14, 1985, when the tragedy occurred on October 15, 1985; and (12)
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>, the victim's husband, said that his
wife informed her of the incident on September 15, 1985, not October 15, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">He also maintains that he had successfully established his
defense of alibi by the corroboration of two witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiom in rape cases that the lone testimony of the offended
party, if credible, is sufficient to sustain a conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This is so because no decent and sensible woman will publicly admit being a
rape victim and thus run the risk of public contempt--the dire consequence of a
rape charge--unless she is, in fact, a rape victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>
testified clearly and simply that on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1985</st1:date>, at dawn, the accused entered her hut and then ravished
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, she never wavered in
her story, and the trial judge was convinced that it was a credible story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Albeit as a rule, this Court is bound by the
findings of the trial court, especially as to credibility of testimonies, we
are ourselves convinced, from a reading of the transcript of stenographic
notes, that she is indeed a credible witness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What

<p class="BODY">As we held in one case, "when a victim says that she has
been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to show that the rape has
been committed, and if her testimony meets the test of credibility, the accused
may be convicted on the basis thereof.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies the accused refers to now involve
minor details that do not negate the existence of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> never used the word "rape" in the course of
her testimony was because of the sordid nature of the tale she was about to
tell, and its embarrassing impact on the audience before her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the prosecution was constrained to
move:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Your Honor, the witness is
reluctant of [sic] answering, we move for the exclusion of the audience.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In any event, she testified that the accused "got my womanhood,"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

words that positively signify a forcible sexual encounter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her statement that it was her husband, "Carding" <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>, who victimized her has been obviously taken out of
context.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We turn specifically to her

<p class="BODY">We are not convinced either, of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
pretenses that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> never offered enough
resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she testified, the
accused struck her twice in the abdominal area, for which she dropped to the
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she lay helpless, the accused
consummated his lustful purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one
decision, this Court held that force is relative, and it need only be shown
that the accused had resorted to intimidation, sufficient to weaken another's
defenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> warning, after violating
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar's</span> honor, "[d]o not tell Carding, I
will come back again," does not denote an existing "past"
between Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> and the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in that statement that would
purvey this impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It exists only
in the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> imagination.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise believe that the victim had sufficiently identified
the accused, as the guilty party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
hut was lighted by a kerosene lamp, and we have ruled that the lighting
produced by a <span class="SpellE">gasera</span> enables one to identify
positively, persons in the dark of night.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> failed or
refused to confront the accused the morning after is nothing conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not perish claims of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> insistence that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> implicated him to get
even for an act of theft she believed the accused was earlier responsible for,
is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Court has
time and again indicated, no self-respecting Filipina, in accusing another of
rape, would risk the perpetual stigma of a scarlet letter, unless her charges
were true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unimaginable, more so
in this case, that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> would voluntarily open
herself to public ridicule only for the flimsy reason that the accused had
earlier stolen her money.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also makes capital of the inconclusiveness of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Natividad's</span> medical
report, first, that it makes no finding that the victim had been raped; second,
the doctor found the victim's sexual organ negative for sperm cells; and third,
no bruises or injuries were found on the victim's body.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, a medical finding is by itself unnecessary to show
rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
As the Court earlier declared, the lone testimony of the offended party is
sufficient, if otherwise credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
presence or absence of traces of spermatozoa is too, immaterial, since it is
penetration, however slight, and not ejaculation, that makes for rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
It is true that the victim, at the trial, alleged that the accused had seminal
discharges, and that she felt them, but quite manifestly, she was
mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the nagging fact
remains that the accused did penetrate her, and when she told the trial judge
that he did, she said all that needed to be said.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of bruise marks on her torso is not absolutely
essential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all blows leave marks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discrepancies as to dates--Dr. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
declared that he prepared his report on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1985</st1:date> while Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span>
declared that the incident happened on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1985</st1:date>--are simply due to lapses of memory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
later rectified his error.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
On the question of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Pajar's</span> misstatement, that
the event transpired on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="9">September 15,
 1985</st1:date>, we credit that also to the failure of memory, bearing in mind
that <span class="SpellE">Pajar</span> testified almost two years after the
tragedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all events, these errors do
not erase the fact that rape had been committed, whatever the date on which it
happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we can not sustain the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
objections and denials.</p>

<p class="BODY">And most of all, we can not accept his argument of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For alibi to prosper, it must be shown that
it was physically impossible for the accused to have gone to the scene of the
crime at the time it happened.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The place he claimed he was at the time, San Vicente West, attending a wake,
was only 500 meters away from the locus <span class="SpellE">criminis</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have easily slipped out of sight for
a few minutes and returned to the wake unnoticed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused has not, finally, ascribed any motive upon the
complainant why she should falsify evidence against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
