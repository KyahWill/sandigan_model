4:30 p.m. on May 21, 1986, while he was playing cards at the porch of their
house located at 4248 Imelda Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Pitogo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila, together with his friends named <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Malbano</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ric</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> and Rosalinda <span class="SpellE">Remorosa</span>, his sister, five policemen, among whom was
Policeman Henry Ortiz, came up and they asked for the whereabouts of Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> who was his friend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He accompanied the policemen to the house of Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>
which was only three houses away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the permission of Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato's</span> mother, he went
straight to the room of Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>, while the
policemen who were following him stayed at the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that moment, Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>
was wrapping marijuana with typewriting paper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he informed Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> that there were
policemen with him, the latter gathered all the marijuana and attempted to
throw it outside but he was able to grab it and he gave the same to Pat. Henry
Ortiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was brought to the
Police Headquarters while Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> was
interrogated at the jeep by Pat. Henry Ortiz and was being asked to <span style="">give </span>an amount of P3,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> told

marked as Exhibits D-1 to D-19 as the same marijuana which he grabbed from
Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> and he turned over to the policemen.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court a quo adjudged the accused guilty of the
crime charged, and sentenced him to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> plus a fine of twenty five thousand pesos.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From this disposition, the accused submits the following

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in acting with manifest and clear <span style="">bias </span>and prejudice against the accused
during the trial of the case.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span>II</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred when it considered the uncorroborated,
inconsistent and contradictory testimony of prosecution witness, Pfc. HENRY
DELA CRUZ, as the primary basis for the conviction of appellant when such
evidence is insufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of
innocence.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred when it failed to consider the testimonial
admissions of prosecution's witnesses which corroborate the testimony of the
accus<span style="">e</span>d, and sufficiently casts
[sic] serious doubts as to the truth of the alleged buy-bust operation which
led to the arrest of the accused.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred when it admitted in evidence the money bills
marked as Exhibits "B" and "B-1".</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in concluding that the unwillingness of the
persons mentioned by the accused with whom he was playing cards in his house
when the policemen came, to testify for the accused implies falsity of his
version.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VI</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in holding the accused ROMEO REMOROSA guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of having sold Marijuana, in violation of Article II, Section
4, of Republic Act No. 6425.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">First, on error number one.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not true, as the appellant complains, that the trial court
did not rule on the petition of the <span style="">accused
</span>for reinvestigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court resolved the same in its Order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1986</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor is there basis for the appellant's charge that the trial court did <span style="">not rule on </span>the offer of the evidence
of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1987</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
attests that the trial court did admit the prosecution evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that there is no formal offer of evidence for
the accused attached to the record and that there is no order admitting the
evidence of the defense, these circumstances alone can not overturn the
presumption that official duty has been regularly performed and that judicial
proceedings are regular.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In any case, here the records show, in the hearing of <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1986</st1:date>, that the defense rested its
case, the lower court admitted its evidence, and declared the case submitted
for decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The gripe of the appellant that the trial court was too liberal
in granting postponements to the prosecution, but allowed only one resetting in
his favor, thus suggesting partiality on the part of the trial court, deserves
no consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
that the trial court allowed the prosecution several postponements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the appellant forgot was that he had not
objected to those continuances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
granting or denial of postponement is within the sound discretion of the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this instance, we are
convinced that the trial court did not abuse such discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if the appellant had been granted only
one resetting by the trial court, it was because after the termination of the
testimony of the accused, the defense counsel immediately rested the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally disturbing is the claim of the appellant that the lower
court deprived him of his right to secure the attendance of his witnesses and
of the production of other evidence on his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first instance, the appellant did not
ask for, much less insist on, the said right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No motion or request had been filed by his lawyer to compel the attendance
of his witnesses nor the production of documents on his behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can the lower court be faulted for these
remissions of the accused?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
defense counsel believed that there were other witnesses to be presented, he
should have called for them, even by compulsory process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the Court painstakingly re-evaluating the proceedings,
could not find in the actuations of the court a quo what could be construed as
prejudicial to the rights of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simply, the conduct of the court <span style="">a
quo </span>was above board.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, assigned error number one is without basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rest of the errors assigned can be integrated into the
principal <span style="">issue </span>of whether or
not the trial court <span style="">erred in </span>determining
the credibility of the evidence presented and the weight to be given to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, the trial court's findings of fact are accorded
substantial weight, possessing <span style="">as </span>it
does the opportunity of discerning whether or not witnesses are telling the
truth,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
by observing their deportment and manner of testifying at the witness
stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this rule does not apply
where the trial court overlooked certain facts of substance and value which
would affect the result <span style="">of </span>the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Another entrenched rule is that the testimonies of prosecution witnesses who
are law enforcers are given credence for it is presumed that they were performing
their duty in the absence of convincing proof to the contrary.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the exception to the rule finds application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is "convincing proof to the
contrary" generated by the conflicting statements of Pat. de la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his examination-in-chief, he reconstructed
the events that transpired on <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="5">May 21,
 1986</st1:date> in this manner:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon instruction of P/Lt. Ramon <span class="SpellE">Salido</span>,

<p class="BODY">On the basis thereof, an information for felonious selling of one
tea bag containing dried marijuana flowering tops was filed against the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on recall, Pat. de la Cruz testified that in the same
buy-bust operation of <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1986</st1:date>,
eighteen more tea bags of marijuana were likewise confiscated from
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All <span style="">in </span>all, nineteen tea bags of marijuana were seized.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another matter that surfaced was the involvement of one Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> from whom dried and crushed marijuana leaves <span style="">wrapped i</span>n typewriting paper were

<p class="BODY">The court finds itself asking questions that should have been
asked by the trial court:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At what point
were the eighteen tea bags of marijuana seized from appellant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was it before, simultaneous with, or after,
the alleged buy-bust operation?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
appellant charged <span style="">as </span>regards the

why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was the participation of
Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span>?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Was he also charged?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not,
why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It puzzles this Court that the
prosecution simply left the apparent inconsistencies unexplained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made no effort at reconciling them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the whole, the gaps and omissions in the
evidence of the prosecution do not refer to minor or collateral matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These sins of omission cast serious doubt on
the credibility of witness Pat. de la Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The net effect--the veracity of the prosecution's story--has been <span class="SpellE">bemuddled</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule
is firm that:</p>

<blockquote>Irreconcilable and unexplained contradictions in the testimonies of
the prosecution witnesses cast doubt on the guilt of appellant<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Simply, that moral certainty of appellant's culpability has not
been attained in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the
obvious contradictions on material points corroborate and <span class="SpellE">strenghten</span>
appellant's version of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Particularly, the account of the appellant that the one tea bag of
marijuana purportedly sold by him to Pat. de la Cruz and the other eighteen tea
bags of marijuana allegedly confiscated from him actually belonged to Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> who was collared in his (<span class="SpellE">Beato's</span>)
residence by the five policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant knew one of these policemen by the name of Pat. "Henry"
Ortiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">policeman </span>was the one to whom the appellant gave the nineteen
tea bags of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus clear
that this version of the incident squares with the testimony on recall of Pat.
de la Cruz that nineteen tea bags of marijuana were allegedly seized from the
appellant, the participation of Nelson <span class="SpellE">Beato</span> from
whom marijuana dried leaves wrapped in typewriting paper were confiscated, and
the presence of five policemen, one by the name of <span class="SpellE">Hermie</span>
Ortiz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though appellant stated that the
name is "Henry," it is possible that he was mistaken considering that
