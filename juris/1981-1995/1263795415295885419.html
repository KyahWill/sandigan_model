<p>On 11 May 1965, Leona Corpus and Iladia Corpus, claiming to be the legal 
heirs of the late spouses Domingo Corpus and Clara Sibayan, filed an action 
against the spouses Jacinta Corpus and Pedro Aduca, in the then Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan, for the recovery of possession, with damages, of a 
parcel of land, with an area of 2,153 square meters, situated in Barrio 
Pinmaludpud, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, and registered in the name of "Heirs of 
Domingo Corpus" under TCT No 49663 of the Register of Deeds of 
Pangasinan.<br><br>The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that the described 
property belonged to the spouses Domingo Corpus and Clara Sibayan, both of whom 
were already dead, the first having died in 1948 and the second in 1911; that 
the said spouses left two (2) children, namely:&nbsp; Leona Corpus, one of the 
plaintiffs herein, and Alberto Corpus who died in 1936 leaving as sole heir, his 
daughter Iladia Corpus, the other plaintiff herein; that during his lifetime, 
but after the death of Clara Sibayan, Domingo Corpus lived with one Fermina 
Tabas without benefit of marriage because she was then a married woman and he 
begot a daughter, Jacinta Corpus, one of the defendants herein; that on 13 May, 
1964, Pedro Aduca, husband of Jacinta Corpus, purporting to represent the heirs 
of Domingo Corpus, prevailed upon one Doroteo Cresencia in whose name the 
property in question was erroneously registered under OCT No. 35511, to execute, 
as he did execute, a document denominated:&nbsp; "Deed of Reconveyance and 
Confirmation" whereby he (Doroteo Cresencia) reconveyed the property in question 
to the heirs of Domingo Corpus; that by virtue of said document, the defendant 
spouses took possession of the land and procured the issuance of TCT No. 49663 
in the name of "Heirs of Domingo Corpus, represented by Pedro Aduca, his 
son-in-law, of legal age, Filipino, married to Jacinta Corpus and a resident of 
Lupao, Nueva Ecija, Philippines."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Plaintiffs further alleged in their 
complaint that defendant Jacinta Corpus, not having any right to inherit from 
the late Domingo Corpus, is under obligation to deliver the possession of said 
land to the plaintiffs; that the plaintiffs have, on several occasions, demanded 
from the defendants the delivery of the possession of said parcel of land, as 
well as the owner's copy of TCT No. 49663 so that the same could be cancelled 
and transferred in the names of plaintiffs but the defendants, for no 
justifiable cause or valid reason, refused and still refuse to do so and instead 
claimed absolute and exclusive ownership over the land; and that before the 
filing of the suit, serious and earnest efforts were exerted by the plaintiffs 
to settle the case amicably with the defendants, but the same were of no avail 
so that the plaintiffs were constrained to go to court to protect their rights 
and incurred damages as a result thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Answering, the defendants denied 
that the property in question belonged to the late spouses Domingo Corpus and 
Clara Sibayan, claiming that they purchased the said property from Doroteo 
Cresencia by virtue of the document entitled:&nbsp; "Deed of Reconveyance and 
Confirmation" executed in their favor on 13 May 1964; and that, while the 
vendees mentioned in said document, are the heirs of Domingo Corpus, the 
defendants, who are also heirs of Domingo Corpus, are the intended vendees.&nbsp; 
Wherefore, they prayed that the complaint be dismissed and the plaintiffs 
ordered to pay them damages and attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After several postponements at the 
behest of both parties, the trial court, in an Order, dated 3 August 1967, set 
the pre-trial conference on 28 August 1967.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 15 August 1967, however, counsel for 
the defendants filed a motion for the postponement of the pre-trial conference 
set for 28 August 1967 claiming that he had to appear before the Court of First 
Instance of Nueva Ecija on the same date in connection with Civil Case No. 
SD-206 of said court.&nbsp; A copy of the Order issued in Civil Case No. SD-206 of 
the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija was appended to the motion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>When the motion for postponement 
was heard on 28 August 1967, counsel for the plaintiffs interposed vigorous 
opposition thereto, claiming that he was not furnished with a copy of said 
motion for postponement.&nbsp; The trial court, after finding that the case had been 
pending for a long time and that several postponements had already been granted 
the parties, and that the defendants' motion for postponement was not filed in 
accordance with the Rules of Court as to notice to the opposing party, denied 
the motion for postponement and allowed the plaintiffs to present their evidence 
<em>ex-parte</em> before the clerk of court who was commissioned to receive the 
same.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>A copy of the trial 
court's Order dated 28 August 1967 denying defendants' motion for postponement 
and allowing the plaintiffs to adduce evidence <em>ex-parte</em> was received by 
defendants on 12 September 1967.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
Defendants took no step to have said Order reconsidered and set aside.<br><br>On 
1 April 1968, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive part of which 
reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, considering that the allegations in the complaint had been 
satisfactorily established and proven, and finding the claim of the plaintiffs 
to be meritorious, the court, hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiffs 
and against the defendants as follows:<br><br>(a)&nbsp; Declaring the plaintiffs the 
legal heirs of the deceased spouses Domingo Corpus and Clara Sibayan, and, 
therefore, the exclusive and lawful owners of the herein controverted property 
registered under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 49663 of the Office of the 
Register of Deeds for Pangasinan issued in the name of the "Heirs of Domingo 
Corpus";<br><br>(b)&nbsp; Ordering the defendants to vacate the aforementioned 
property and to turn over the possession thereof and deliver the corresponding 
certificate of title (T.C.T. No. 49663) thereto, to the plaintiffs; 
and<br><br>(c)&nbsp; Ordering further the defendants to pay to the plaintiffs the sum 
of P400.00 for damages, P200.00 for attorney's fees and the costs of this 
suit."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Counsel for the defendants received a copy of the decision on 7 June 1968, 
and on 1 July 1968, he filed a motion for new trial, praying that:&nbsp; (1) a new 
trial be held on the ground that the failure of the defendants and their counsel 
to be present at the pre-trial conference set for 28 August 1967 was due to 
mistake or excusable negligence; (2) the decision dated 1 April 1968 be set 
aside and the defendants be allowed to cross-examine the witnesses for the 
plaintiffs and to present evidence on their behalf; and (3) the defendants be 
awarded such other reliefs and remedies as are just and equitable under the 
premises.<br><br>In support of his motion for new trial, counsel for the 
defendants contended that he complied with the requirement regarding notice to 
adverse parties by sending a copy of his motion for postponement to counsel for 
the plaintiffs by registered mail on 15 August 1967; and that his non-appearance 
at the pre-trial conference on 28 August 1967 was justified as he had to attend 
on the same date another hearing in the Court of First Instance of Nueva 
Ecija.<br><br>Counsel for the defendants further claimed that Domingo Corpus 
died on 15 April 1956, and not in 1948, as claimed by the plaintiffs, so that 
the defendant Jacinta Corpus, although a spurious child of Domingo Corpus, is 
entitled to a share in the estate of said Domingo Corpus.&nbsp; A copy of the death 
certificate of Domingo Corpus, attested to by the Local Civil Registrar of 
Mu√±oz, Nueva Ecija where the said Domingo Corpus died, was attached to the 
motion<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The trial court, 
however, in an Order dated 6 August 1968, denied the motion for new trial on the 
grounds that the Order issued on 28 August 1967, copy of which was received by 
counsel for the defendants on 12 September 1967, had already become final when 
the defendants filed their motion for new trial on 1 July 1968; and that the 
alleged misrepresentation by the plaintiffs of the true date of the death of 
Domingo Corpus is not a ground for new trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>Whereupon, the defendants 
interposed the present appeal.&nbsp; They claim that the lower court erred:&nbsp; (1) in 
denying their motion for postponement and in allowing the plaintiffs to present 
their evidence <em>ex-parte</em>; and (2) in denying their motion for new 
trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>We find no merit in the 
appeal.&nbsp; To begin with, we see nothing abusive or irregular in the actions taken 
by the lower court in denying the defendants-appellants' motion for postponement 
of the pre-trial conference set for 28 August 1967, and their motion for new 
trial.&nbsp; A close examination of the record shows that said motion for 
postponement does not show that a copy thereof had been served upon the adverse 
party as there is no proof of service thereof.&nbsp; In fact, the movants did not 
indicate therein the manner by which a copy of the motion was served upon 
counsel for the plaintiffs-appellees.&nbsp; Counsel for the defendants-appellants 
merely stated therein:&nbsp; "Copy furnished Atty. Federico R. Vinluan, San Nicolas, 
Pangasinan." In the motion for new trial, counsel for the defendants-appellants 
claimed that he sent to plaintiffs-appellees' counsel a copy of the motion for 
postponement by registered mail.&nbsp; The motion for postponement, however, does not 
contain an affidavit of the person who mailed the motion, showing compliance 
with the provisions of Section 5, Rule 11 of the Rules of Court, and the 
registry receipt issued by the mailing office, as required by Section 10 of the 
same Rule.<br><br>Neither does the motion for postponement adverted to state the 
time and place for the hearing of the same, as required by the Rules of Court.&nbsp; 
In the said motion for postponement, counsel of the defendants-appellants 
addressed the Clerk of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Urdaneta 
Branch, thus:&nbsp; "Upon receipt of the foregoing motion please submit the same to 
the Honorable Court for its consideration."<br><br>And yet, the provisions of 
the Rules of Court requiring that a motion shall state the time and place of the 
hearing of the same are quite clear.&nbsp; Sections 4 and 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of 
Court expressly provide that a motion shall state the time and place of the 
hearing and shall be served upon all the parties concerned at least three (3) 
days in advance.&nbsp; And, according to Section 6 of the same Rule, no motion shall 
be acted upon by the court without proof of such notice, and it has been held 
that, in such a case, the motion is nothing but a useless piece of paper.&nbsp; The 
reason is obvious:&nbsp; unless the movant sets the time and place of hearing, the 
court would have no way of determining whether the adverse party agrees or 
objects to the motion, and if he objects, to hear him on his objection, since 
the Rules do not fix any period within which he may file his reply or opposition 
thereto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Besides, it appears 
that it was defendants-appellants' counsel who had to be in Cabanatuan City on 
the date of hearing so that the defendants-appellants themselves could have 
appeared in Court on the date set for the hearing since their presence at the 
pre-trial conference was also required.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> But, as it stands, both 
defendants-appellants and their counsel failed to appear at the pre-trial 
conference.&nbsp; It is a well-settled rule that the grant or denial of a motion for 
postponement is discretionary on the court.&nbsp; The defendants-appellants, as well 
as their counsel, should not have presumed that the motion for the deferment of 
the pre-trial conference would be granted.&nbsp; They had no right to rely on the 
liberality of the court or on the generosity of the adverse 
party.<br><br>Defendants-appellants should also have taken upon themselves the 
duty to inquire as to what action the court took on their motion for the 
postponement of the pre-trial conference.&nbsp; In this, they 
failed.<br><br>Moreover, we see no wisdom in re-opening the case for the 
reception of the evidence of defendants-appellants.&nbsp; Their theory is weak and 
the presentation of their relied upon evidence, consisting of the death 
certificate of Domingo Corpus, will not, as we see it, vary the terms or outcome 
of the judgment.&nbsp; It will also result in a change of the theory of the defense 
which is not allowed.&nbsp; The case involves the ownership and possession of a 
parcel of land with an area of 2,153 square meters situated in Barrio 
Pinmaludpud, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, registered in the name of "Heirs of Domingo 
Corpus, represented by Pedro Aduca, his son-in-law, of legal age, Filipino, 
married to Jacinta Corpus and a resident of Lupao, Nueva Ecija, Philippines" 
under TCT No. 49663 of the Register of Deeds of Pangasinan The 
plaintiffs-appellees claim that they are the legitimate heirs of Domingo Corpus, 
the plaintiff-appellee Leona Corpus being his daughter and the 
plaintiff-appellee Iladia Corpus, his granddaughter, and therefore, entitled to 
the whole estate of said Domingo Corpus at the time of his death in 1948.&nbsp; They 
further claim that the defendant-appellant Jacinta Corpus, the wife of the 
defendant-appellant Pedro Aduca, is a spurious child of Domingo Corpus and, 
therefore, without any successional rights to his estate at the time of his 
death in 1948.<br><br>Upon the other hand, defendants-appellants do not really 
claim successional rights over the land.&nbsp; Defendants-appellants base their right 
over the land upon the document, entitled:&nbsp; "Deed of Reconveyance and 
Confirmation" which they claim to be a simple deed of sale of the land executed 
in their favor by its registered owner, Doroteo Cresencia.<br><br>A careful 
reading of the aforestated document will show that it is not a simple deed of 
sale in favor of the defendants-appellants, as claimed by them, but a deed of 
<em>reconveyance</em> of a parcel of land, as it purports to be, where the 
assignor has acted as a trustee in securing the title of the land in his name 
and now is transferring the same to the rightful owners, the heirs of Domingo 
Corpus.&nbsp; Essential portions of the document read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That I, DOROTEO CRESENCIA, of legal age, Filipino, married to Maximiana 
Benigas and a resident of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, for and in consideration of the 
sum of ONE HUNDRED PESOS (P100.00), Philippine Currency, to me paid in full to 
my entire satisfaction, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged from the 
Heirs of DOMINGO CORPUS, represented by Pedro Aduca, his son-in-law, of legal 
age, Filipino, married to Jacinta Corpus and a resident of Lupao, Nueva Ecija, 
Philippines do by these present, hereby reconvey all my rights, interests and 
participations over that portion consisting of TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY 
THREE (2,153) square meters, or Lot B of Subdivision Plan Psd-34444, of that 
parcel of land more particularly described and bounded as 
follows:</p></blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>xxx</td>
<td>
<div align="center">xxx</div></td>
<td>
<div align="right">xxx</div></td></tr></tbody></table>
<blockquote>
<p><br>"That I promised to the vendee before that as soon as I receive the ONE 
HUNDRED PESOS (P100.00), Philippine Currency, I will execute the foregoing 
instrument to be registered and I promised that I merely acted as a trustee in 
securing the title for the above-named vendee until I receive the said title and 
I could have executed the proper document for registration."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>As may be seen therefrom, the defendant-appellant, Pedro Aduca, merely acted 
as the <em>representative</em> of the heirs of Domingo Corpus.&nbsp; The fact that 
Domingo Corpus may have died in 1956 (and not in 1948) will not make his 
(Aduca's) claim any better.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the judgment 
appealed from should be, as it is hereby, AFFIRMED, without pronouncement as to 
costs.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
