				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In these petitions the issues raised are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG) has the power to conduct a preliminary
investigation of the anti-graft and corruption cases filed by the Solicitor
General against Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>, Jr. and other
respondents for the alleged misuse of coconut levy funds; and (2) on the
assumption that it has jurisdiction to conduct such a preliminary investigation,
whether or not its conduct constitutes a violation of petitioner's rights to
due process and equal protection of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1989</st1:date>,
President Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> directed the Solicitor
General to prosecute all persons involved in the misuse of coconut levy
funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the above directive
the Solicitor General created a task force to conduct a thorough study of the
possible involvement of all persons in the anomalous use of coconut levy funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1990</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General filed two criminal complaints with respondent PCGG
docketed under I.S. Nos. 74 and 75.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG assigned both complaints to prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario for
preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
scheduled both cases for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Del Rosario prepared a <u>subpoena</u> dated January 16, 1990
setting the preliminary investigation on January 29, 1990 at 2:00 o'clock in
the afternoon as to respondents Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span>,
Jose <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span>, Felix <span class="SpellE">Due√±as</span>,
Jr., and Salvador <span class="SpellE">Escudero</span>, III, and on January 31,

Jr., Rolando de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zayco</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled preliminary investigation on <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1990</st1:date> petitioner appeared
through counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing a
counter-affidavit, as required in the <u>subpoena</u>, he filed two motions
addressed to the PCGG, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) a
motion to disqualify/inhibit PCGG; alternatively, a motion to dismiss; and (2)
motion to have the PCGG itself hear or resolve <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco's</span>
motion to disqualify/inhibit PCGG alternatively, motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecutor <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario denied both
motions and declared the proceedings closed and the cases submitted for
resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, petitioner
requested the PCGG to resolve directly his aforesaid motions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1990</st1:date>,
the PCGG issued an order denying petitioner's motions and required him,
together with all the respondents in I.S. Nos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">74 and 75 to submit counter-affidavits within five (5)
days from receipt thereof.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner did not submit the required counter-affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead, he filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1990</st1:date> the herein petitions for prohibition with
prayer for a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">He alleges that the PCGG may not conduct a preliminary
investigation of the complaints filed by the Solicitor General without
violating petitioner's rights to due process and equal protection of the law,
and that the PCGG has no right to conduct such preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is prayed that a temporary restraining order
be issued enjoining the respondents and any or all persons acting under their
orders or in their behalf from continuing with the preliminary investigation of
I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 and enjoining as well the PCGG from taking any further
action on said cases; and after hearing on the merits, to issue a writ of
preliminary injunction prohibiting respondent PCGG from conducting a
preliminary investigation of said criminal complaints and to order that the
records of I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 be forwarded to the Ombudsman for such action he
may consider appropriate and to pay the costs of the suits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1990</st1:date>, this Court, without giving due course to the petition,
resolved to require respondents to comment thereon within ten (10) days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the PCGG issued an order that reads as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Considering that none of the respondents have filed their
counter-affidavits and supporting evidence, except respondent <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zayco</span>, the
complaints filed against them may now be considered submitted for resolution by
this Commission.</p>

<p class="2Q">Since the respondents, except <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Zayco</span>, have not submitted counter-affidavits and <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence, the evidence submitted by the
complainants stands <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And this Commission finds the findings and
conclusions of fact of the investigating prosecutor, that a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case has been established against all the respondents, including <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zayco</span>, to warrant
the filing of an information for a violation of Section 3(1) in relation to
Section 3(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) thus making them liable under Section
3(a) of RA 3019, to be well-founded<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Wherefore, let the corresponding information be filed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

petitioner and all other respondents named in I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 which were
docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 14398 and 14399.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Solicitor General filed with the PCGG several
other complaints against petitioner and several others bearing on the misuse of
the coconut levy funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Two of these
complaints were docketed as I.S. Nos. 79 and 82. A panel of prosecutors
designated by the PCGG issued a <u>subpoena</u> to petitioner in order to
compel him to appear in the investigation of said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1990</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a supplemental petition informing the Court of the filing of
said <span class="SpellE">informations</span> and the additional complaints <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
prays that a temporary restraining order be issued enjoining respondents and
other persons acting under their orders or in their behalf from continuing with
the preliminary investigation of as well as taking further action in I.S. Nos.
79 and 82 and similar cases filed with the PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also prays that, after hearing,
the PCGG be prohibited from continuing with the preliminary investigation of I.
S. Nos. 79 and 82 and that it be ordered to forward the records of the case to
the Ombudsman for appropriate action, and to pay the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, petitioner filed a motion reiterating the petition
for the issuance of a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary
injunction and alternatively seeking that the case be set for hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court admitted the supplemental pleading of the petitioner; required
respondents to comment thereon within a non-extendible period of ten (10) days
from notice; and issued a <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> order prevailing at the time
this petition was filed on <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="3">March 12,
 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 2, 1990, a consolidated comment was submitted by the
respondents attaching as annex thereto the letters of the Executive Secretary
dated February 9, 1990 and February 21,1990, respectively, addressed to the
Chairman, PCGG, conveying the instructions of the President of the Philippines
that the complaints involving coconut levy funds be filed with the PCGG, to
conduct the necessary investigation and if warranted to file and prosecute the
cases before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>; and it confirmed the
earlier instructions of the President dated November 28,1989 to the same
effect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1990</st1:date>
petitioner filed a reply to the consolidated comment as required by the
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1990</st1:date>, the Solicitor General
was required to file a rejoinder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1990</st1:date>, a motion for hearing of
said cases was filed by petitioner and this was granted by the Court on <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was directed that the Ombudsman be <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as party-respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court required the Ombudsman to comment
on the petition within ten (10) days from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="7">Tuesday, July 17, 1990</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00</st1:time> in the morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ombudsman submitted his comment on <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1990</st1:date> and the Court required petitioner to
file a reply to the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1990, Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Lobregat</span>
and Jose R. <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span>, Jr. filed a Motion for Leave to Intervene
and a Motion to Admit Petition to Intervene wherein they ask that the PCGG
desist from further proceeding with the preliminary investigation of I.S. Nos.
74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, and 84 charging the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
and other respondents, including petitioner, with violations of the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act No. 3019) in connection with the
coconut levy funds. The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> question the
authority of the PCGG to conduct a preliminary investigation of the said
cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that even assuming
that the PCGG has such <span class="GramE">authority,</span> the same cannot be
delegated to a prosecutor or his assistants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court granted the motion for leave to intervene and admitted the petition
for intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG was required
to comment on said petition within ten (10) days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1990</st1:date>,
respondents filed their rejoinder to the reply of petitioner to their
consolidated comments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ombudsman
filed his comment to the petition for intervention, while petitioner filed his
reply to the comment of the Ombudsman on <st1:date year="1990" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The hearing was held as scheduled on <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1990</st1:date> where all the parties including the
Ombudsman appeared and/or were duly represented by counsels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing, the parties were required

of the hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1990</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General asked for an extension of time within which to file his
comment to the petition for intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He filed said comment within the period of extension asked for on <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The memoranda of all the parties having been submitted, the
petitions were deemed submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue wherein petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
question the authority of the PCGG to conduct a preliminary investigation of
the criminal complaints filed against them by the Solicitor General, the Court
finds and so holds the same to be devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 2, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure
the officers authorized to conduct a preliminary investigation <span class="GramE">are</span> the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the adoption of the 1987 Constitution, the Office of the

appropriate action.</blockquote>

interpreting the aforesaid provision of the Constitution, particularly Section
13(1) thereof vesting on the Ombudsman the right and the power to investigate
on its own or on complaint, any act or omission of any public official, employee,
office or agency which appears "to be illegal, unjust, improper, or
inefficient", held that the general power of investigation covers the
lesser power to conduct a preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as the power of investigation vested on
the Ombudsman under the Constitution includes the power to conduct a
preliminary investigation, then the special prosecutor (former <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>) may no longer conduct such a preliminary
investigation unless duly authorized by the Ombudsman.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">A reading of the foregoing provision of the Constitution does not
show that the power of investigation including preliminary investigation vested
on the Ombudsman is exclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the said provision of the Constitution did not repeal or remove the power to
conduct an investigation, including the authority to conduct a preliminary
investigation, vested on the PCGG by Executive Orders Nos.1 and 14.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although under Section 26 of Article XVIII of the Constitution
the authority of the PCGG to issue sequestration or freeze orders was maintained
for not more than eighteen months after the ratification of the Constitution,
it cannot be construed thereby that its power of investigation had thereby been
revoked by the failure to reiterate said power in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, upon the passage of Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise
known as the "Ombudsman Act of 1989," it is therein specifically
provided in Section 15 as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 15.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Powers, Functions and

public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission appears
to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and, in the exercise of this primary <span class="GramE">jurisdiction,</span> it may take over, at any stage, from any
investigatory agency of Government, the investigation of such cases;</blockquote>

wealth amassed after <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1986</st1:date>
and the prosecution of the parties involved therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Ombudsman shall give priority to complaints filed against high
ranking government officials and/or those occupying supervisory positions,
complaints involving grave offenses as well as complaints involving large sums
of money and/or properties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 15(1) of Republic Act No. 6770 <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>,
the Ombudsman has primary jurisdiction over cases cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> so that it may take over at any stage from
any investigatory agency of the government, the investigation of such cases.
The authority of the Ombudsman to investigate offenses involving public
officers or employees is not exclusive but is concurrent with other similarly
authorized agencies of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such investigatory agencies referred to include the PCGG and the
provincial and city prosecutors and their assistants, the state prosecutors and
the judges of the municipal trial courts and municipal circuit trial courts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
provision of the law has opened up the authority to conduct preliminary
investigation of offenses cognizable by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
to all investigatory agencies of the government duly authorized to conduct a
preliminary investigation under Section 2, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules Of
Criminal Procedure with the only qualification that the Ombudsman may take over
at any stage of such investigation in the exercise of his primary jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also noted that under Section 15(11) of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> Republic Act No. 6770, among the powers vested
on the Ombudsman is to investigate and to initiate the proper action for
recovery of ill-gotten wealth and/or unexplained wealth amassed <u>after</u>
February 25, 1986 and the prosecution of the parties involved therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court agrees with the contention of the
public respondent PCGG that this provision is a tacit recognition that the
authority of the PCGG to conduct preliminary investigation of ill-gotten wealth
and/or unexplained wealth amassed <u>before</u> <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1986</st1:date> is maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the Court finds and so holds that the aforesaid
provision of the law cannot in any manner dilute or diminish the primary
jurisdiction of the Ombudsman over all such types of cases committed by public
officers or employees as provided in Section 13, Article XI of the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, notwithstanding the
provision of Section 15(11) of Republic Act No. 6770, the primary jurisdiction
of the Ombudsman to investigate covers ill-gotten wealth and/or unexplained
wealth cases that occurred even before <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue raised that the preliminary investigation by the
PCGG of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> complaints violates the right
of petitioner to due process and to equal protection of law is impressed with
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 1, Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure, preliminary investigation is defined as "an inquiry or
proceeding for the purpose of determining whether there is sufficient ground to
engender a well-founded belief that a crime cognizable by the Regional Trial
Court has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof,
and should be held for trial."</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of a preliminary investigation is to secure the innocent
against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and to protect him from an
open and public accusation of a crime, from the trouble, expense, anxiety of a
public trial, and also to protect the state from useless and expensive trials.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conduct of a preliminary investigation is the initial step
towards the criminal prosecution of a person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After such preliminary investigation, if the investigating officer finds
that there is sufficient ground to engender a well-founded belief that a crime
has been committed and that the respondent is probably guilty thereof and
should be held for trial, then the corresponding complaint or information shall
be filed in the competent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
the filing of said complaint or information that initiates the criminal
prosecution of the accused when he is brought to court for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such a preliminary investigation is required for offenses
cognizable by the Regional Trial Court and the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It must be undertaken in accordance with the procedure provided in Section 3,
Rule 112 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This procedure is to be observed in order to
assure that a person undergoing such preliminary investigation will be afforded
due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by petitioner, an indispensable
requisite of due process is that the person who presides and decides over a
proceeding, including a preliminary investigation, must possess the cold
neutrality of an impartial judge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although such a preliminary investigation is not a trial and is not
intended to usurp the function of the trial court, it is not a casual
affair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The officer conducting the same
investigates or inquires into the facts concerning the commission of the crime
with the end in view of determining whether or not <span class="GramE">an
information</span> may be prepared against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, a preliminary investigation is in
effect a realistic judicial appraisal of the merits of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sufficient proof of the guilt of the accused
must be adduced so that when the case is tried, the trial court may not be
bound as a matter of law to order an acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A preliminary investigation has then been called a judicial
inquiry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a judicial proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An act becomes judicial when there is
opportunity to be heard and for, the production and weighing of <span class="GramE">evidence,</span> and a decision is rendered thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority of a prosecutor or investigating officer duly
empowered to preside or to conduct a preliminary investigation is no less than
that of a municipal judge or even a regional trial court judge.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
While the investigating officer, strictly speaking is not a "judge,"
by the nature of his functions he is and must be considered to be a <u>quasi</u>
<u>judicial</u> officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the creation of the PCGG under Executive Order No. 1,
the PCGG sequestered and froze all the properties of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span> in accordance with the powers vested in it by

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1987</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">Earlier however, that is, on <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1990</st1:date>, the PCGG, overruling prosecutor <st1:state><st1:place><span class="GramE">del</span></st1:place></st1:state> <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>'s
order, gave the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> in I.S. Nos. 74 and 75
another period of five (5) days from notice within which to submit their
counter-affidavits and supporting evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Based on this action the PCGG filed a motion for reconsideration of the
aforesaid decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> which had not
been resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to petitioner, on the day of the preliminary investigation
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1990</st1:date>, his
counsel filed a motion to disqualify or inhibit the PCGG, an alternative motion
to dismiss, and a motion to have the PCGG itself hear and/or resolve the motion
to disqualify or inhibit itself alternatively a motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary investigation presided by
prosecutor <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario started at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock P.M.</st1:time> with eight other respondents duly
represented by their counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said
motion was denied and the preliminary investigation was adjourned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately thereafter petitioner brought the matter to Chairman
Mateo A.T. <span class="SpellE">Caparas</span> of the PCGG and in several
communications sought resolution of the motion by the PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February
 27, 1990</st1:date>, the PCGG issued an order denying petitioner's motion to
dismiss for lack of jurisdiction but did not resolve the motion to
disqualify.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therein, the PCGG directed
petitioner to submit his counter-affidavits within five (5) days from receipt
of notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1990</st1:date>,
the same day this petition was filed in this Court, the petitioner, instead of
filing the counter-affidavit, filed with the PCGG an urgent motion to defer
proceedings in I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 for at least until <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1990</st1:date> within which to seek judicial
relief from the order of <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February 27,
 1990</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of
this petition, petitioner filed a supplemental urgent motion to defer proceedings
with the PCGG informing it of the filing of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, on <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="3">March
 14, 1990</st1:date>, the PCGG filed two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
corresponding to the complaints in I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 which are docketed as
Criminal Cases Nos. 14398 and 14399, respectively, at the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG recommended bail as P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for each case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Solicitor General filed two other complaints
against the petitioner with the PCGG accusing the petitioner of violation of
Republic Act No. 3019 and other penal laws in connection with the coconut levy
funds, namely, I.S. No. 79 which concerns an alleged arbitration award in favor
of Agricultural Investors Inc., and I.S. No. 82 which concerns the acquisition
of coconut oil mills.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several other complaints were filed by the Solicitor General with
the PCGG against petitioner for preliminary investigation, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) I.S. No. 80 which concerns the acquisition of the First
United Bank, now United Coconut Planters' Bank; (b) I.S. No. 81 concerning
shares of the United Coconut Oil Mills Inc.; (c) I.S. No. 83 regarding the
acquisition of coconut oil mills and certain indebtedness thereof; and (d) I.S.
No. 84 regarding settlement of an Anti-Graft suit in the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these complaints were for alleged
violation of Republic Act No. 3019.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question that arises, therefore, is whether under the
circumstances of this case, it would be fair and just for the PCGG to conduct
the preliminary investigation of the said complaint instead of the Ombudsman or
any other duly authorized investigating agency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the creation of the PCGG under Executive Order No. 1 issued
by President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, the PCGG was charged with the
task of assisting the President not only in the recovery of ill-gotten wealth
or unexplained wealth accumulated by the former President, his immediate
family, relatives subordinates and close associates but also in the
investigation of such cases of graft and corruption as the President may assign
to the Commission from time to time and to prevent a repetition of the same in
the future.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3 of Executive Order No. 1 provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 3<span class="GramE">.-</span> <u>The Commission shall
have<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the power and authority</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To conduct investigation as may be necessary

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To sequester or place or cause to be placed
under its control or possession any building or office wherein any ill-gotten
wealth or properties may be found, and any records pertaining thereto, in order
to prevent their destruction, concealment or disappearance which would
frustrate or hamper the investigation or otherwise prevent the Commission from
accomplishing its task.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To provisionally take over in the public
interest or to prevent its disposal or dissipation, business enterprises and
properties taken over by the government of the Marcos administration or by
entities or persons close to former President Marcos, until the transactions
leading to such acquisition by the latter can be disposed of by the appropriate
authorities.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To enjoin or restrain any actual or
threatened commission of acts by any person or entity that may render moot and
academic, or frustrate, or otherwise make ineffectual the efforts of the
Commission to carry out its tasks under this order.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To administer oaths, and issue <u>subpoenas</u>
requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and/or the production of
such books, papers, contracts, records, statement of accounts and other
documents as may be material to the investigation conducted by the Commission.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(f)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To hold any person in direct or indirect
contempt and impose the appropriate penalties, following the same procedures
and penalties provided in the Rules of Court.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(g)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To seek and secure the assistance of any
office, agency or instrumentality of the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To promulgate such rules and regulations as
may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing provisions of law, it is clear that the PCGG
has the following powers and authority:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>To conduct an
investigation including the preliminary investigation and prosecution of the
ill-gotten wealth cases of former President Marcos, relatives and associates,
and graft and corruption cases assigned by the President to it;</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Issue sequestration
orders in relation to property claimed to be ill-gotten;</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Issue "freeze
orders" prohibiting persons in possession of property alleged to be
ill-gotten from transferring or otherwise disposing of the same;</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Issue provisional
takeover orders of the said property;</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Administer oaths and
issue <u>subpoenas</u> in the conduct of its investigation;</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Hold any person in
direct or indirect contempt and impose the appropriate penalties as provided by
the rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the PCGG, like the courts, is vested with the
authority to grant provisional remedies of (1) sequestration, (2) freezing
assets, and (3) provisional takeover, it is indispensable that, as in the case
of attachment and receivership, there exists a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
factual foundation, at least, for the sequestration order, freeze order or
takeover order, an adequate and fair opportunity to contest it and endeavor to
cause its negation or nullification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both are assured under the foregoing executive orders and the rules and
regulations promulgated by the PCGG.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Baseco</u></span>, this Court
held, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Executive Order No. 14 enjoins that there be ‚Äòdue regard to
the requirements of fairness and due process.‚Äô Executive Order No. 2 declares
that with respect to claims on allegedly ‚Äòill-gotten‚Äô assets and properties,
‚Äòit is the position of the new democratic government that President Marcos * *
(and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">other parties affected) be
afforded fair opportunity to contest these claims before appropriate Philippine
authorities.‚Äô<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 7 of the
Commission's Rules and Regulations provides that sequestration or freeze (and
takeover) orders issue upon the authority of at least two commissioners, based
on the affirmation or complaint of an interested party, or <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span> when the Commission has reasonable
grounds to believe that the issuance thereof is warranted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A similar requirement is now found in Section
26, Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution, which requires that a ‚Äòsequestration
or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case.‚Äô‚Äù</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the general power of investigation vested in the PCGG
is concerned, it may be divided into two stages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first stage of investigation which is
called the criminal investigation stage is the fact-finding inquiring which is
usually conducted by the law enforcement agents whereby they gather evidence
and interview witnesses after which they assess the evidence and if they find
sufficient basis, file the complaint for the purpose of preliminary
investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second stage is the
preliminary investigation stage of the said complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is at this stage, as above discussed,
where it is ascertained if there is sufficient evidence to bring a person to
trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petition before this Court, it is not denied that the PCGG
conducted the appropriate criminal investigation of petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> as a law enforcer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the process it sequestered all the
properties of the petitioner after a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> finding that the
same amount to ill-gotten wealth and/or <span class="GramE">were</span> acquired
in relation to allegedly anomalous disposition or misuse of the coconut levy
funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG then filed on July 31, 1987 a complaint docketed as
Civil Case No. 0033 against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
not only for alleged ill-gotten wealth as associates of former President Marcos
but for the unlawful concert with the former President and his wife to unjustly
enrich themselves at the expense of the Filipino people through the alleged
misuse, misappropriation and dissipation of the coconut levy funds, as
enumerated in the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
complaint was verified and filed by the then Chairman of the PCGG and also
signed by the Solicitor General and the Assistant Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the allegations in the civil complaint, are the very
transactions now subject of the criminal complaints filed by the Solicitor
General against petitioner to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the
Solicitor General filed the first two complaints against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> among others, under I.S. Nos. 74 and 75 for
alleged violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act for donations
allegedly made out of coconut levy funds to the Philippine Coconut Producers
Federation (COCOFED).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> questioned
not only the authority of the PCGG to conduct the preliminary investigation but
asserted a denial of due process and equal protection of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is cogent basis for their plea.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG, as a law enforcer, gathered evidence as to the alleged ill-gotten
wealth of petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> and, after
satisfying itself that there is a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case, sequestered
and issued a freeze order for all the properties of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based also on the said finding of a <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case, the PCGG filed a civil complaint docketed as Civil Case No.
0033 against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> for alleged
ill-gotten wealth including the alleged misuse, misappropriation, and diversion
of coconut levy funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">As hereinabove discussed the criminal complaints under I. S. Nos.
74, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 and 84 filed by the Solicitor General all for alleged
violation of Republic Act No. 3019, are covered and alleged in the aforesaid
civil complaint docketed as Civil Case No. 0033.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG conducted the preliminary investigation of I.S. Nos. 74
and 75 and is poised to conduct the preliminary investigation of the other
aforementioned complaints for the same alleged violations of law subject of the
civil complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot close its eyes to the glaring fact that in earlier
instances, the PCGG had already found a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case against
the petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> when, acting like a
judge, it caused the sequestration of the properties and the issuance of the
freeze order of the properties of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, acting as a law enforcer, in collaboration with the
Solicitor General, the PCGG gathered the evidence and upon finding cogent basis
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> filed the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
civil complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently the
Solicitor General filed a series of criminal complaints.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is difficult to imagine how in the conduct of such preliminary
investigation the PCGG could ever make a turn about and take a position
contradictory to its earlier findings of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case
against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was demonstrated in the undue haste with
which I.S. Nos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>74 and 75 was
investigated and the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were filed in court
even as the petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> questioned its
authority, invoked the denial of due process and promptly informed the PCGG of
the filing of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our criminal justice system, the law enforcer who conducted
the criminal investigation, gathered the evidence and thereafter filed the
complaint for the purpose of preliminary investigation cannot be allowed to
conduct the preliminary investigation of his own complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is to say the least arbitrary and unjust.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in such instances that <span class="GramE">We</span> say one
cannot be "a prosecutor and judge at the same time." Having gathered
the evidence and filed the complaint as a law enforcer, he cannot be expected
to handle with impartiality the preliminary investigation of his own complaint,
this time as a public prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of the instant petition are even worse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the PCGG and the Solicitor General
finding a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> basis filed a civil complaint against
petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> alleging substantially the
same illegal or criminal acts subject of the subsequent criminal complaints the
Solicitor General filed with the PCGG for preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While ostensibly, it is only the Solicitor
General who is the complainant in the criminal cases filed with the PCGG, in
reality the PCGG is an unidentified co-complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, when the PCGG issued the sequestration and freeze
orders against petitioner's properties, it was on the basis of a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
finding that the same were ill-gotten and/or <span class="GramE">were</span>
acquired in relation to the illegal disposition of coconut levy funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court finds that the PCGG cannot
possibly conduct the preliminary investigation of said criminal complaints with
the "cold neutrality of an impartial judge," as it has prejudged the
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Add to this the fact that there
are many suits filed by petitioner and the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
against the PCGG and vice versa.</p>

<p class="BODY">For lesser grounds this Court had disqualified a fiscal or a
judge from handling a case. </p>

<p class="BODY">A fiscal was disqualified from conducting a preliminary
investigation because he had appeared for the prosecution when said case was
pending in the municipal court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In a case filed before the Commission on Elections this Court held Commissioner
Opinion should not have participated in the case since he was the former lawyer
of Arturo <span class="SpellE">Pacificador</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
A judge was required to inhibit himself in a case where he was a witness for
the complainant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
A judge before whom the extrajudicial statement of one of the accused was

A judge who told the complainant his case was weak and it would be to his
advantage to settle the case was disqualified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> A
judge against whom an administrative complaint was filed by one of the parties
was also disqualified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
In a case where the motion for inhibition was found to be groundless, this
Court held that the judge should inhibit himself considering the seriousness of
the charges.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
A judge was asked to inhibit himself from trying a <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
case against the accused since he previously convicted the latter of arson.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
In another case, the judge was ordered to inhibit himself because of strained
relationship with the defendant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are numerous other cases wherein the judges and fiscals
were disqualified on similar grounds as those aforementioned.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Where the circumstances do not inspire confidence in the
objectivity and impartiality of the judge, such judge should inhibit
voluntarily or if he refuses, he should be prohibited from handling the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A judge must not only be impartial
but must also appear impartial as an assurance to the parties that his decision
will be just.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
His actuation must inspire that belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is an instance when appearance is as important as reality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The same rule of thumb should apply to an investigating officer
conducting a preliminary investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is the reason why under Section 1679 of the former Revised
Administrative Code, the Secretary of Justice, who has supervision over the
prosecution arm of the government, is given ample power to designate another
prosecutor to handle the investigation and prosecution of a case when the
prosecutor handling the same is otherwise disqualified by personal interest, or
is unable or fails to perform his duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that under the circumstances of the case, the
PCGG cannot inspire belief that it could be impartial in the conduct of the
preliminary investigation of the aforesaid complaints against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
cannot possibly preside in the said preliminary investigation with an even
hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court holds that a just and fair administration of justice
can be promoted if the PCGG would be prohibited from conducting the preliminary
investigation of the complaints subject of this petition and the petition for
intervention and that the records of the same should be forwarded to the
Ombudsman, who as an independent constitutional officer has primary
jurisdiction over cases of this nature, to conduct such preliminary
investigation and take appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">All violators of the law must be brought before the bar of
justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, they must be afforded
due process and equal protection of the law, whoever they may be.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions of Eduardo M. <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>,

</span>All proceedings of the preliminary investigation conducted by the PCGG
of said complaints are hereby declared null and void including the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> which it filed in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
against petitioner and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> docketed as

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.:</i><span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the Court's decision penned by my distinguished
colleague, Mr. Justice Emilio A. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG cannot preside over these cases with
an even <span class="GramE">hand,</span> much less inspire the slightest belief
in its impartiality and fairness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where the PCGG has sequestered properties, arrived at precise
conclusions, and filed a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">CIVIL case </span>for
the recovery or forfeiture of those properties, it is disqualified from
conducting any preliminary investigation of CRIMINAL charges pertaining to the
same alleged ill gotten wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an
interested party in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">CIVIL </span>case,
it is incapable of acting fairly in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">CRIMINAL
</span>case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the Court's ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">I feel, however, that the Court should have gone further.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the unquestioned jurisdiction given to the
Ombudsman by the Constitution and statute, the PCGG should no longer continue
conducting preliminary investigations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It should limit itself to the preparation and filing of civil cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its conduct of preliminary investigations is
so colored by the basic reason for its creation, its institutional structure,
and its obsession to recover everything that it perceives and suspects to be
ill gotten wealth that it cannot help but run roughshod over fundamental
requirements of fair play in criminal cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nowhere is pre-judgment <span class="GramE">so</span> evident as in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In filing the civil case against Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>,
the PCGG has concluded with certainty that he is guilty of
"misappropriation and theft of public funds, plunder of the nation's
wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement, and other acts of
corruption, betrayal of public trust and brazen abuse of power, as more fully
described below, all at the expense and to the grave irreparable damage of
Plaintiff and the Filipino people." (See complaint in CC 0033, <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, pp. 2 and 3) Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>
has been asked to pay more than P100 Billion in damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was placed on the "hold order"
lists of PCGG and prohibited from coming home to defend himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His wife, children, and grandchildren hold
cancelled passports and are indefinitely exiled.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1990</st1:date>
when the preliminary investigation was to be conducted, a voluminous motion to
inhibit the PCGG was filed by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It took the PCGG Prosecutor exactly ten (10) minutes to deny the motion
and pass upon the complex constitutional and jurisdictional issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court needed several months to
deliberate and resolve the same issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from its having been created for the sole purpose of
recovering the ill gotten wealth of ex-President Marcos, his relatives end
cronies, the make-up of the PCGG prevents it from being independent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Chairman and members serve at the
absolute pleasure of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">law </span>prescribes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">no </span>qualifications for their appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">doe</span>s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>not mention future appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>replete
with incidents of non-objectivity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner has repeatedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">filed </span>motions
to inspect the records of his former companies to enable him to defend
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Motions which an ordinary
Fiscal, Prosecutor, or Judge would routinely grant are denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court itself in, G.R. No. 91741
has ruled that the petitioner had been singled out by the PCGG and given biased
treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that same case, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span><span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
found no probable cause for the arrest of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We sustained the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue which the Court should have explored further is
the constitutional right of all accused persons to equal protection of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the appointment, tenure, functions, and
objectives of the PCGG prevent it from being fair and objective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its actions in this case show that indeed it
cannot be fair and objective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
temporary office given a fixed mission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has to accomplish that mission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Ombudsman is created by the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is vested with
"independent" powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
enjoys fiscal autonomy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is insulated
from interference by the political departments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The qualifications for Ombudsman are found in the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They include "recognized probity and
independence." He must have been a <span class="SpellE">practising</span>
lawyer or Judge for at least ten (10) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The incumbent Ombudsman has served in the Supreme Court, Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>Appeals, Court of First Instance,
Department of Justice and high level fact finding committees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was at the top <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>his class at the <st1:place><st1:placename>U.P.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place> of Law and has been a
distinguished Professor of Law for decades.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was nominated and appointed Ombudsman on the record of his
unquestioned competence, intellectual <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">skills,
</span>integrity, and independence. </p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above considerations, persons who appear
before the PCGG and not the Ombudsman are clearly denied the equal protection
guaranteed by the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no substantial basis for some respondents to appear before the biased and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">less </span>competent PCGG while others
appear before the impartial and more competent Ombudsman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The line drawn between public officials in
office before <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1986</st1:date>
and those in public office after <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="2">February
 25, 1986</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>arbitrary
and discriminatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are no
substantial distinctions permitting a valid classification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And as stressed by the petitioner, is there a
substantial distinction between those who committed graft and corruption under
former President Marcos and those who are now committing (according to media
and the Roman Catholic hierarchy) graft and corruption under President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner argues:</p>

<blockquote>"The violation of equal protection thus becomes clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not four years after EDSA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three years after the ratification of the new
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Must there be one kind of
justice for the 'victors', another for the ‚Äòvanquished'?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there not but one Filipino under the
Constitution?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no cogent reason
why the liberty of those who were associated with former President Marcos
should lie in the hands of PCGG and not in the Ombudsman who is independent of
the President, and, of course, the Solicitor General, and is precisely mandated
by the Constitution to deal with draft and corruption cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is thus a denial of equal protection of the law that the
petitioner has been subjected to preliminary investigation for violation of
R.A. No. 3019 by PCGG rather than by the Ombudsman." (Petitioner's
Memorandum, p. 41)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Impartiality and fundamental fairness are inherent rights of all
persons brought before our criminal justice system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The social justice provisions of the
Constitution mandate that the State must take special measures to protect these
rights when the accused are the outcasts and the poor or belong to a group
which is ignored, disliked, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>hated
by those currently in power.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the Marcos administration, a top leader of the then
opposition was ordered prosecuted in what were clearly railroaded proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court struck down the charade of a
preliminary investigation and among, other things, stated:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The purpose of preliminary investigation is to secure the
innocent against hasty, malicious and oppressive prosecution, and to protect
him from an open and public accusation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of</span>
crime, from the trouble, expense and anxiety of a public trial, and also to
protect the state from useless and expansive trials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>
v. Manta, 118 SCRA 241; citing <span class="SpellE">Hashim</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Boncan</span>, 71 Phil. 216).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to a preliminary investigation is a
statutory grant, and to withhold it would be to transgress constitutional due
process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Oandasa</span> 25 SCRA 277) However, in order to satisfy the due
process clause it is not enough that the preliminary investigation is conducted
in the sense of making sure that a transgressor shall not escape with
impunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A preliminary investigation
serves not only the purposes of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>More important, it is a part of the guarantees of freedom and fair play
which are <span class="SpellE">birthnights</span> of all who live in our
country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, imperative
upon the fiscal or the judge as the case may be, to relieve the accused from
the pain of going through a trial once it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is
</span>ascertained that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a prima facie
case or that no probable cause exists to form a sufficient belief as to the
guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>no general formula or fixed rule for
the determination of probable cause since the same must be decided in the light
of the conditions obtaining in given situations and its existence depends to a
large degree upon the finding or opinion of the judge conducting the
examination, such a finding should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">not </span>disregard
the facts before the judge nor run counter to the clear dictates of reason (See
La Chemise <span class="SpellE">Lacoste</span>, S.A. v. Fernandez, 129 SCRA
391).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judge or fiscal, therefore,
should not go on with the prosecution in the hope that some credible evidence
might later turn up during trial for this would be a flagrant violation of a
basic right which the courts are created to uphold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears repeating that the judiciary lives
up to its mission by vitalizing and not denigrating constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So it has been before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should continue to be so." (<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> v. Cruz <span class="SpellE">Pa√±o</span>, 134 SCRA
438, 461-462)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court today can do no less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has to apply the same yardstick to the PCGG.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same guarantees of fairness and justice
in this decision of the Court rendered during the time of Mr. Marcos belong in
equal measure to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span> and all who appear
before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">PCGG </span>during the term
of President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>
