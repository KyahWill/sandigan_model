the bid of the petitioner was found to be the lowest by the Awards Committee
with Mr. <span class="SpellE">Cris</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> as
chairman; and that the cash bond in the amount of P120,000.00 was deposited by
respondent GSIS in its account with the PNB together with the P300.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the basis of the
foregoing facts petitioner contends that the contract between him and
respondent GSIS was deemed perfected and that the decision of the trial court should
have been affirmed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the proposal form
submitted by petitioner when he bid for the project, it specifically provides
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We (or I) will complete the work in strict accordance with
the plans, specifications and related <u>contract </u><u><span style="">documents</span></u><span style=""> </span>within two hundred ten (210) calendar days from date we (or I) <u>received

faithful performance of the work."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is clearly spelled out that once a
proposal or bid is accepted, the bidder must be sent a notice of acceptance and
within ten (10) days thereafter from receipt of said notice from the respondent
GSIS, he will enter into a contract with the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the day the bidder received a copy of
the duly certified contract he must complete the work in accordance with the
plans and specifications and the related contract within 210 calendar days.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that petitioner appears to be the lowest bidder
and was so declared by the respondent GSIS, the rules of the bidding as
contained in the proposal form are clear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is only upon receipt of notice of acceptance that the formal contract
shall be executed between the lowest bidder and the respondent GSIS, and it is
only then that the contract is deemed perfected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although Board Resolution No. 596 dated <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1972</st1:date> was passed by the Board
of Trustees of the GSIS approving the recommendation to award the bid to
petitioner this was nevertheless not officially released and delivered to the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">A mere determination of a public official or bid to accept the
proposal of a bidder does not constitute a contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision should be communicated to the
bidder.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the bid of the petitioner in this case could not be
immediately accepted by respondent GSIS as his bid for P2<span class="GramE">,398,636.00</span>
exceeded the approved appropriation for <span style="">the
project in the amount of P1,639,000.00 so that an additional appropriation of
P930,000.00 was necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even as such
additional appropriation was approved by the Board of Trustees of respondent
GSIS the same still had to be submitted to the OEC for approval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact said office disapproved the proposal
and instructed the GSIS to review the plans and specification and to conduct a
re-bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent GSIS had no
alternative but to inform petitioner of this turn of events and return to the
petitioner his cash deposit of P120<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent GSIS could not have accepted the bid of petitioner
without the approval of the OEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
in the notice to the contractors it is specifically stated:</p>

<blockquote>"'The GSIS reserves the right to <u><span style="">reject </span>any and all bids</u>, to waive informalities therein or <u>to
accept</u> such bids as may be <u>advantageous </u><u><span style="">to the </span>System</u>.’ (Underscoring supplied)"<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, since no notice of acceptance was given to the
petitioner and no formal contract was executed, there was therefore no
perfected contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no meeting
of the minds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> the judgment of the Court of Appeals
