<p>In this Petition for Review of two (2) Orders of the Court of First Instance 
of Cebu the question raised is whether the widow whose husband predeceased his 
mother can inherit from the latter, her mother-in-law.<br><br>It appears from 
the record of the case that on February 26, 1971, Mrs. Petra V. Rosales, a 
resident of Cebu City, died intestate.&nbsp; She was survived by her husband 
Fortunato T. Rosales and their two (2) children Magna Rosales Acebes and Antonio 
Rosales.&nbsp; Another child, Carterio Rosales, predeceased her, leaving behind a 
child, Macikequerox Rosales, and his widow Irenea C. Rosales, the herein 
petitioner.&nbsp; The estate of the deceased has an estimated gross value of about 
Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00).<br><br>On July 10, 1971, Magna Rosales 
Acebes instituted the proceedings for the settlement of the estate of the 
deceased in the Court of First Instance of Cebu.&nbsp; The case was docketed as 
Special Proceedings No. 3204-R.&nbsp; Thereafter, the trial court appointed Magna 
Rosales Acebes administratrix of the said estate.<br><br>In the course of the 
intestate proceedings, the trial court issued an Order dated June 16, 1972 
declaring the following individuals the legal heirs of the deceased and 
prescribing their respective share of the estate —<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunato T. 
Rosales (husband), ¼;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magna R. Acebes (daughter), ¼;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Macikequerox Rosales, ¼' and<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Antonio Rosales (son), ¼.<br><br>This 
declaration was reiterated by the trial court in its Order dated February 4, 
1975.<br><br>These Orders notwithstanding, Irenea Rosales insisted in getting a 
share of the estate in her capacity as the surviving spouse of the late Carterio 
Rosales, son of the deceased, claiming that she is a compulsory heir of her 
mother-in-law together with her son, Macikequerox Rosales.<br><br>Thus, Irenea 
Rosales sought the reconsideration of the aforementioned Orders.&nbsp; The trial 
court denied her plea.&nbsp; Hence this petition.<br><br>In sum, the petitioner poses 
two (2) questions for Our resolution.&nbsp; First — is a widow (surviving spouse) an 
intestate heir of her mother-in-law?&nbsp; Second — are the Orders of the trial court 
which excluded the widow from getting a share of the estate in question final as 
against the said widow?<br><br>Our answer to the first question is in the 
negative.<br><br>Intestate or legal heirs are classified into two (2) groups, 
namely, those who inherit by their own right, and those who inherit by the right 
of representation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Restated, an 
intestate heir can only inherit either by his own right, as in the order of 
intestate succession provided for in the Civil Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>, or by the right of representation 
provided for in Article 981 of the same law.&nbsp; The relevant provisions of the 
Civil Code are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><br>"Art. 980.&nbsp; The children of the deceased shall always inherit from him in 
their own right, dividing the inheritance in equal shares."<br><br>"Art. 981.&nbsp; 
Should children of the deceased and descendants of other children who are dead, 
survive, the former shall inherit in their own right, and the latter by right of 
representation."<br><br>"Art. 982.&nbsp; The grandchildren and other descendants 
shall inherit by right of representation, and if any one of them should have 
died, leaving several heirs, the portion pertaining to him shall be divided 
among the latter in equal portions.”</p>
<p>"Art. 999.&nbsp; When the widow or widower survives with legitimate children or 
their descendants and illegitimate children or their descendants, whether 
legitimate or illegitimate, such widow or widower shall be entitled to the same 
share as that of a legitimate child."</p></blockquote>
<p>There is no provision in the Civil Code which states that a widow (surviving 
spouse) is an intestate heir of her mother-in-law.&nbsp; The entire Code is devoid of 
any provision which entitles her to inherit from her mother-in-law either by her 
own right or by the right of representation.&nbsp; The provisions of the Code which 
relate to the order of intestate succession (Articles 978 to 1014) enumerate 
with meticulous exactitude the intestate heirs of a decedent, with the State as 
the final intestate heir.&nbsp; The conspicuous absence of a provision which makes a 
daughter-in-law an intestate heir of the deceased all the more confirms Our 
observation.&nbsp; If the legislature intended to make the surviving spouse an 
intestate heir of the parent-in-law, it would have so provided in the 
Code.<br><br>Petitioner argues that she is a compulsory heir in accordance with 
the provisions of Article 887 of the Civil Code which provides that:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Art. 887.&nbsp; The following are compulsory heirs:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)&nbsp; Legitimate 
children and descendants, with respect to their legitimate parents and 
ascendants;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2)&nbsp; In default of the foregoing, legitimate parents and 
ascendants, with respect to their legitimate children and 
descendants;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)&nbsp; The widow or widower;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4)&nbsp; Acknowledged 
natural children, and natural children by legal fiction;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)&nbsp; Other 
illegitimate children referred to in article 287;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compulsory heirs 
mentioned in Nos. 3, 4 and 5 are not excluded by those in Nos. 1 and 2; neither 
do they exclude one another.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In all cases of illegitimate children, 
their filiation must be duly proved.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The father or mother of 
illegitimate children of the three classes mentioned, shall inherit from them in 
the manner and to the extent established by this Code."<br><br>The aforesaid 
provision of law<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> refers to the estate 
of the deceased spouse in which case the surviving spouse (widow or widower) is 
a compulsory heir.&nbsp; It does not apply to the estate of a 
parent-in-law.<br><br>Indeed, the surviving spouse is considered a third person 
as regards the estate of the parent-in-law.&nbsp; We had occasion to make this 
observation in <em>Lachenal v. Salas</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>"We hold that the title to the fishing boat should be determined in 
Civil Case No. 3597 (not in the intestate proceeding) because it affects the 
lessee thereof, Lope L. Leoncio, the decedent's <em>son-in-law, who, although 
married to his daughter or compulsory heir, is nevertheless a third person with 
respect to his estate</em>.&nbsp; xxx." (Emphasis supplied).
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>By the same token, the provision of Article 999 of the Civil Code aforecited 
does not support petitioner’s claim.&nbsp; A careful examination of the said Article 
confirms that the estate contemplated therein is the estate of the deceased 
spouse.&nbsp; The estate which is the subject matter of the intestate estate 
proceedings in this case is that of the deceased Petra V. Rosales, the 
mother-in-law of the petitioner.&nbsp; It is from the estate of Petra V. Rosales that 
Macikequerox Rosales draws a share of the inheritance by the right of 
representation as provided by Article 981 of the Code.<br>The essence and nature 
of the right of representation is explained by Articles 970 and 971 of the Civil 
Code, <em>viz</em> —</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Art. 970.&nbsp; Representation is a right created by fiction of law, by virtue of 
which the representative is raised to the place and the degree of the person 
represented, and acquires the rights which the latter would have if he were 
living or if he could have inherited.<br><br>"Art. 971.&nbsp; The representative is 
called to the succession by the law and not by <em>the person represented.&nbsp; The 
representative does not succeed the person represented but the one whom the 
person represented would have succeeded.</em>" (Emphasis 
supplied.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Article 971 explicitly declares that Macikequerox Rosales is called to 
succession by law because of his blood relationship.&nbsp; He does not succeed his 
father, Carterio Rosales (the person represented) who predeceased his 
grandmother, Petra Rosales, but the latter whom his father would have 
succeeded.&nbsp; Petitioner cannot assert the same right of representation as she has 
no filiation by blood with her mother-in-law.<br><br>Petitioner however contends 
that at the time of the death of her husband Corterio Rosales he had an inchoate 
or contingent right to the properties of Petra Rosales as compulsory heir.&nbsp; Be 
that as it may, said right of her husband was extinguished by his death that is 
why it is their son Macikequerox Rosales who succeeded from Petra Rosales by 
right of representation.&nbsp; He did not succeed from his deceased father, Carterio 
Rosales.<br><br>On the basis of the foregoing observations and conclusions, We 
find it unnecessary to pass upon the second question posed by the 
petitioner.<br><br>Accordingly, it is Our considered opinion, and We so hold, 
that a surviving spouse is not an intestate heir of his or her 
parent-in-law.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, in view of the foregoing, the 
Petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, with costs against the petitioner.&nbsp; 
Let this case be remanded to the trial court for further 
proceedings.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.<br><br><em>Yap, (Chairman), 
Narvasa, Melencio-Herrera, Cruz, Feliciano, </em>and<em> Sarmiento, JJ., 
</em>concur.<br><br><br><br></p>
