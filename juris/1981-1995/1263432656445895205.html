				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to reverse
the decision of the Court of Appeals dated March 15, 1990 affirming <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>
the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Imus, Cavite, Branch 21, directing
the Philippine Airlines, Inc. (PAL, for short) to pay the private respondents
the amounts specified therein as actual, moral and temperate damages as well as
attorney’s fees and expenses of <span style="">litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are briefly recounted by the appellate
court, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Plaintiffs Jaime Ramos, Nilda Ramos, Erlinda Ilano, Milagros
Ilano, Daniel Ilano and Felipa Javalera, are officers of the Negros Telephone
Company who held confirmed tickets for PAL Flight No. 264 from Naga City <span style="">to Manila on September 24, 1985, scheduled to
depart for Manila at 4:25 p.m.  The
tickets were bought sometime in August 1985.  Among the conditions included in plaintiffs’ tickets is the following:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘1.  CHECK-IN TIME - Please
check in at the Airport Passenger check-in counter <u>at</u> <u>least</u> <u>one</u>
<u>hour</u> <u>before</u> PUBLISHED departure time of your flight.  We will consider your accommodation
forfeited in favor of waitlisted passengers if you fail to check-in <u>at</u> <u>least</u>
<u>30</u> <u>minutes</u> before PUBLISHED departure time.  Exh. (1-A-A, 2-A-1, S-A, O-A-1, tsn, Nov.
23, 1987, p. 8).’<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Plaintiffs claim in their Complaint that they went to the check-in
counter of the defendant’s Naga branch at least one (1) hour before the
published departure time but no one was at the counter until 30 minutes before
departure, but upon checking-in and presentation of their tickets to the
employee/clerk who showed up, their tickets were cancelled and the seats
awarded to chance passengers; plaintiffs had to go to Manila by bus, and seek
actual, moral and exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees for breach of contract
of carriage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Defendant disclaims any liability, claiming that the
non-accommodation of plaintiffs on said flight was due to their having check-in
(sic) late for their flight.  It is
averred that even if defendant is found liable to the plaintiffs such liability
is confined to, and limited by, the CAB Economic Regulations No. 7 in
conjunction with P.D. 589.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The trial court rendered judgment finding defendant guilty of
breach of contract of carriage in bumping-off the plaintiffs from its F264
flight of September 24, 1985, and ordered defendant to pay:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P1,250.20 - the total value of the tickets;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P22.50 - the total value of airport security
fees and terminal fees;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P20,000.00 - for each of the plaintiffs for
moral and temperate damages; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P5,000.00<i>
- </i></span>for attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation.” (Rollo, pp.
35-36)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">PAL appealed to the Court of Appeals.  On March 15, 1990, the appellate court rendered a decision, the
dispositive portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>,
with costs against appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“SO ORDERED.” (Rollo, p. 42)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition with the following legal questions:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the Honorable
Court of Appeals validly promulgate the questioned decision by the simple
expedient of adopting <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> the trial court’s finding that
defendant-appellant is liable for damages on the sole issue of credibility of
witnesses without considering the material admissions made by the plaintiffs
and other evidence on record that substantiate the defense of
defendant-appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can the Honorable
Court award legally moral and temperate damages plus attorneys fees of
P5,000.00 contrary to the evidence and established jurisprudence.” (Rollo, p.
9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, each party in a
case is required to prove his affirmative allegations.  In civil cases, the degree of evidence
required of a party in order to support his claim is preponderance of evidence
or that evidence adduced by one party which is more conclusive and credible than
that of the other party (Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 83376, May 29, 1989, 173 SCRA 619, 625).</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar presents a simple question of fact:  Whether or not the private respondents were
late in checking-in for their flight from Naga City to Manila on September 24,
1985.  It is immediately apparent from
the records of this case that the claims of the parties on this question are
dramatically opposed.  As <span style="">a </span>rule, the determination of a
question of fact depends largely on the credibility of witnesses <u><span style="">unless</span></u><span style=""> </span>some documentary evidence is available which clearly
substantiates the issue and whose genuineness and probative value is not
disputed (Legarda v. Miaile, 88 Phil. 637, 642).  The exception to the rule now runs true in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reverse.  This case
once more illustrates Our power to re-weigh the findings of lower courts when
the same are not supported by the record or not based on substantial evidence
(see Cruz v. Villarin, G.R. No. 75679, January 12,1990, 181 SCRA 53, 61).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an admitted fact that the private respondents knew of the
required check-in time for passengers.  The time requirement is prominently printed as one of the conditions of
carriage on their tickets, i.e., that the airport passenger should check-in <u>at</u>
<u><span style="">least</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>one</u> <u><span style="">hour</span></u><span style=""> </span>before
published departure time of his flight and PAL shall consider his accommodation
forfeited in favor of waitlisted passengers if he fails to check-in at least 30
minutes.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that while the aforequoted condition has always been
applied strictly and without exception (TSN, December 16, 1987, p. 11), the
station manager, however, may exercise his discretion to allow <span style="">p</span>assengers who checked-in late to
board provided the flight is not fully booked and seats are available (<u>ibid</u>,
pp. 17-18).  On September 24, 1985,
flight 264 from Naga to Manila was fully booked owing to the Peñafrancia
Festival (TSN, January 25, 1988, p. 5).  In addition, PAL morning flights 261 and 262 were cancelled resulting in
a big number of waitlisted passengers.  (TSN, November 23, 1987, p. 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents claim that they were on time in
checking-in for their flight; that no PAL personnel attended to them until much
later which accounted for their late check-in; that PAL advanced the check-in
time and the departure of their flight resulting in their non-accommodation;
and that they suffered physical difficulties, anxieties and business losses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record does not support the above contentions.  We note that there were two other confirmed
passengers who came ahead of the private respondents but were refused
accommodation because they were late.  Edmundo Araquel, then the check-in-clerk, testified on this point, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Atty. Marcelino C. Calica, counsel for
PAL</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the plaintiffs arrive (sic) at the
check-in counter, do you recall if there were other passengers who arrived at
the counter and they were advised that they were late?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
were those persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My former classmates at Ateneo, sir, Rose
Capati and </span>Go, <span style="">Merly.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were these two passengers also confirmed
passengers on this flight?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
show to you a<i style=""> </i>document which is
entitled ‘Passenger Manifest of flight 264, September 24, 1985,’ which we request
to be marked as Exh. ‘5’ you said earlier that aside from the plaintiffs here
there were two other passengers who also checked in but they were also late and
you mentioned the names of these passengers as Capati and Go, please point to
us that entry which will show the names of Go and Capati?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, sir, numbers 13 and 14 of the
Manifest.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“ATTY. CALICA:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We request that passengers 13 and 14 be marked in evidence, Go for
13 and Capati for 14 as Exh. ‘5-A.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said that these two passengers you mentioned were also similarly denied
accommodations because they checked in late, did they check in before or after
the plaintiffs?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Before, </span><span style="">sir.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What time did they appear at the counter?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>4:01
p.m., sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened when they checked in at 4:01?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
told them also that they were late so they cannot be accommodated and they
tried to protest, but they decided later on just to refund the ticket.” (TSN of
November 23, 1987, pp. 11-12)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Shortly after, the private respondents
followed the aforesaid two passengers at the counter.  At this juncture, Araquel declared, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
you said that you met the plaintiffs in this case because they were passengers
of Flight 264 on September 24, 1985 and they were not accommodated because they
checked in late, what time did these plaintiffs check in?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around 4:02 p.m., <span style="">sir.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who was the clerk at the
check in counter who attended to them?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was the one, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You said when you were
presented the tickets of the plaintiffs in this case and noting that they were
late for checking in, immediately after advising them that they were late, you
said you made annotation on the tickets?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am showing to you Exhs.
‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ and ‘D,’ which are the tickets of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jaime Ramos for
Exh. ‘A,’ Exh. ‘B’ ticket of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Daniel Ilano, ‘C’ ticket of Felipa
Javalera and ‘D’ ticket of Erlinda Ilano, will you please go over the same and
point to us the notations you said you made on these tickets?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This particular time,
sir.  (Witness pointing to the notation
‘Late’ and the time ‘4:02’ appearing at the upper right-hand of the tickets
Exhs. ‘A,’ ‘B,’ ‘C,’ and ‘D.’)</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How long did it take
after the tickets were tendered to you for checking in and before you made this
notation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was just seconds,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the tickets being
tendered for check-in and noting that they were late, you mean to say you
immediately made annotations?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.  That is an S.O.P. of the office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So on what time did you
base that 4:02?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the check-in counter
clock, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time you placed
the time, what was the time reflected at the counter clock?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>4:02, sir.” (<u>ibid</u>,
pp. 8-11)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The private respondents submitted no
controverting evidence.  As clearly
manifested above, the intervening time between Capati and Go and the private
respondents took only a mere second.  If
indeed, the private respondents were at the check-in counter at 3:30 p.m., they
could have been the first ones to be attended to by Araquel than Capati and
Go.  They could have also protested if they
were the earliest passengers at the counter but were ignored by Araquel in
favor of Go and Capati.  They did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise improbable that not a single PAL personnel was in
attendance at the counter when the check-in counter was supposed to be opened
at 3:25 p.m.  It must be remembered that
the morning flight to Manila was cancelled and hence, it is not farfetched for
Us to believe that the PAL personnel then have their hands full in dealing with
the passengers of the morning flight who became waitlisted passengers.  Moreover, the emphatic assertions of private
respondent Daniel Javalora Ilano regarding the absence of a PAL personnel lost
its impact during the cross examination:</p>

<blockquote>“ATTY. CALICA?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
you maintain therefore that for all the time that you waited there for the
whole twenty (20) minutes the check-in counter and other PAL Offices there -
the whole counter was completely unmanned?  I am referring to the whole area there where it is enclosed by a counter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I will describe to you,
for the benefit of the court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When you approach the
counter at Naga Airport, the counter is enclosed, I mean, you cannot just go
inside the PAL office, right?  there is
some sort of counter where you deal with the PAL personnel and you approximate
this counter to be five (5) to six (6) meters.  Now, this space after the counter, did you observe what fixtures or
enclosures are contained there inside the enclosed space?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am not sure whether there are offices or enclosures there.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
have been travelling and had opportunity to check-in your tickets so many
times.  Everytime that you check-in, how
many personnel are manning the check-in counter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
are about three (3) or four (4), sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Everytime,
there are three (3) or four (4)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Everytime
but not that time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am referring to your previous trips, I am not referring to this incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On previous occasions
when you took the flight with Pili Airport and you see three (3) or four (4)
personnel everytime, are all these three (3) or four (4) personnel at the
counter or some are standing at the counter or others are seated on the table
doing something or what?  Will you
describe to us?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
are handling the baggages and some are checking-in the tickets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
on most occasions when you check-in and say, there were at least three (3) or
four (4) people at the check-in counter, one would attend to the tickets,
another to the check in baggage, if any.  Now, do you notice if somebody evade when you check-in your ticket.  This other person would receive the flight
coupon which is detached from your ticket and record it on what we call
passenger manifest?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That’s
true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
it is clear one would attend to the baggage, another person would receive the ticket,
detach the coupon and one would record it on the passenger manifest.  What about the fourth, what was he doing, if
you recall?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
think, putting the identification tags on the baggages (sic).” (TSN, November
17, 1986, p. 38)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Ilano’s declaration becomes even more
patently unreliable in the face of the Daily Station Report of PAL dated
September 24, 1985 which contained the working hours of its personnel from 0600
to 1700 and their respective assignments, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“ATTY.  CALICA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Normally
upon opening of the check-in counter, how many PAL personnel are assigned to
man the counter?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“EDMUNDO ARAQUEL</blockquote>

assistance of others.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

are these personnel assigned to the counter and what specific duties they
performed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Oropesa handled the cargo, Mr. Espiritu handled the ticketing, Mr. Valencia and
me handled the checking in of passengers.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you referring to this particular flight
264 on September 24, 1985?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who was assigned as check-in clerk that particular
time?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is significant to note that there were
no other passengers who checked-in late after the private respondents (TSN,
November 23, 1987, p. 13).  In the
absence of any controverting evidence, the documentary evidence presented to
corroborate the testimonies of PAL’S witnesses are <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence of the truth of their allegations.  The plane tickets of the private respondents, exh. “1,” “2,” “3,” “4,”
(with emphasis on the printed condition of the contract of carriage regarding
check-in time as well as on the notation “late 4:02” stamped on the flight coupon
by the check?in clerk immediately upon the check-in of private
respondents) and the passenger Manifest of Flight PR 264, exh. “5,” (which
showed the non-accommodation of Capati and Go and the private respondents) are
entries made in the regular course of business which the private respondents
failed to overcome with substantial and convincing evidence other than their
testimonies.  Consequently, they carry
more weight and credence.  A writing or
document made contemporaneously with a transaction in which are evidenced facts
pertinent to an issue, when admitted as proof of those facts, is ordinarily
regarded as more reliable proof and of greater probative force than the oral
testimony of a witness as to such facts based upon memory and recollection (20 Am
Jur S 1179, 1029 cited in Francisco, <u>Revised</u> <u>Rules</u> <u>of</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u> <u>Annotated</u>, 1973 Edition, Volume
VII, Part II, p. 654).  Spoken words
could be notoriously unreliable as against <span style="">a </span>written document that speaks a uniform language (Spouses Vicente
and Salome de Leon v. CA, et al., G.R. No. 95511, January 30, 1992).  This dictum is amply demonstrated by the
diverse allegations of the private respondents in their complaint (where they
claimed that no one was at the counter until thirty (30) minutes before the
published departure time and that <u>the</u> <u>employee</u> who finally
attended to them marked them late, Records, p. 2) and in their testimonies
(where they contended that there were <u>two</u> <u>different</u> <u>PAL</u> <u>personnel</u>
who attended to them at the check-in counter, TSNs of November 17, 1986, pp.
41-45 and of May 18, <span style="">1987, </span>pp.
5-6).  Private respondents’ only
objection to these documents is that they are self-serving cannot be
sustained.  The hearsay rule will not
apply in this case as statements, acts or conduct accompanying or so nearly
connected with the main transaction as to form a part of it, and which
illustrate, elucidate, qualify or characterize the act, are admissible as part
of the <u>res</u> <u>gestae</u> (32 C.J.S., S. 411, 30-31).  Based on these circumstances, We are
inclined to believe the version of PAL.  When the private respondents purchased their tickets, they were
instantaneously bound by the conditions of the contract of carriage
particularly the check-in time requirement.  The terms of the contract are clear.  Their failure to come on time for check-in should not militate against
PAL.  Their non-accommodation on that
flight was the result of their own action or inaction and the ensuing
cancellation of their tickets by PAL is only proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, We do not find anything suspicious in the fact that
PAL flight 264 departed at 4:13 p.m. instead of 4:25 p.m.  Apart from their verbal assertions, the
private respondents did not show any evidence of irregularity.  It being clear that all the passengers have
already boarded, there was no sense in keeping them waiting for the scheduled
time of departure before the plane could take flight.</p>

Appeals dated March 15, 1990 is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.  No costs.</p>
