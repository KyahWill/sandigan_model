(Zacarias, Dominador Manayon, Bomby Lastimosa and Tony Pantoja) had a drinking

inches high from the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
Dominador Manayon, Bomby Lastimosa and Tony Pantoja were standing on the ground
beside the edge of the porch, Zacarias Tampipi was seated at the nearby corner
thereof and his wife Norma was seated across him near the door leading to the
living room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Beside Norma was a small
wick lamp which furnished the illumination around the porch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00

Lastimosa and Tony Pantoja ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Bomby Lastimosa and Tony Pantoja came back and, together with Dominador

<p class="BODY">The records sustain the factual findings of the trial court and
its assessment of the credibility of witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We affirm its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first assigned error, the accused questions the
non-production <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>two other
witnesses who allegedly witnessed the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the wife and the neighbor of the victim
were presented by the prosecution and their testimonies are allegedly biased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the other two eyewitnesses were not presented as
prosecution witnesses at the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">does </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not
</span>work against the prosecution nor invalidate the judgment of
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their testimony, at best,
would have been merely corroborative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. Jandayan, G.R. No. 74871, February 27, 1989).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, one was in fact presented as a witness for the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted by the Solicitor General, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"More importantly, the number of witnesses to be presented and
whom to present are matters within the prosecution's prerogative to
decide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the two witnesses
alluded to by the defense as having been not presented are Antonio Pantoja and
a certain Bomby Lastimosa, and the records show <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">that Antonio Pantoja is the brother-in-law of the accused, his wife
Vicenta Cañete being the sister of accused Romulo Cañete.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being an adverse witness, the prosecution did
not present him as Government witness.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At any rate, Antonio Pantoja was in fact presented as a witness <u>for</u>
<u>the</u> <u>defense</u> and was cross-examined by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his testimony was already taken into consideration
by the trial court in rendering the judgment appealed from.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to Bomby Lastimosa, the record shows that the prosecution sought
his attendance through the issuance of Subpoena (p. 104, rec.) but he failed to
appear despite notice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p. 111, rec.),
prompting the prosecution to dispense with his testimony in order not to delay
the administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides,
his testimony would only be corroborative, and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">so
indispensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, in the
determination of the values and credibility of evidence, witnesses are to be
weighed and not numbered (People v. Nabaunag, 79 SCRA 33 [1977]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the testimony of only one witness, if
credible and thrustworthy, is sufficient to convict (People v. Nabaunag, </span><u>supra</u>).<u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, the accused has all the right and opportunity to have
called Bomby Lastimosa as his own witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing could have prevented accused from doing so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the accused has the right to use the
processes of the court to compel the attendance of witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">This the</span> accused
failed to avail <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should not lay the blame on the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">The relationship </span>between
the prosecution witnesses and the victim does not work against the credibility
of the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held that
where there is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">showing of improper
motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses, the fact that they are related
to the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of
full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Abonada, G. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

January 31,1989).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused points out to alleged improbabilities in the
narration of the prosecution witnesses to impugn their credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that it is improbable that the
victim and the witnesses would drink before taking supper, that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">no </span>"pulutan" and that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">witnesses stood for two hours.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court observed that "[I]t is customary for village
people in order to drive away fatigue and boredom, to "refresh"
themselves with tuba (a cheap local drink taken from coconut sap) and while
away the evening hours with conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And Zacarias Tampipi did just that with Dominador Manayog, Bomby
Lastimosa and Antonio Pantoja who went with him and his wife to and from the
poblacion of Barangay Cawitan on that same fateful day.” (Rollo, p. 30)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not incredible that there would be no "pulutan"
and that some of them would stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing was to prevent them from sitting on the floor as is often done
in the barrios.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is actually no doubt that the accused killed the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted the killing,
although he claims it was done in self-defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">This claim, however, must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are three requisites to prove the claim of self-defense as
stated in paragraph 1 of Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable
necessity of the means employed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">to </span>prevent or repel it; and (3) lack of
sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is elementary that the first requisite of self-defense is indispensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court ruled in the instant case
that this was not satisfactorily proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus there is no self-defense to speak of as it was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">proven that </span>there was unlawful
aggression on the part of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">being
</span>no unlawful aggression, there is nothing to prevent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>repel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ortega v. Sandiganbayan,
G. R. No. 57664, February 8, 1989).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <u>Ebajan</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Appeals</u>, G. R. Nos. 77930-31, February 9, 1989:</p>

<blockquote>"A person who seeks justification for his act must prove by
clear and convincing evidence the presence of the necessary justifying
circumstance for having admitting wounding or killing his adversary, and he is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">criminally liable unless he is able to
satisfy the court that he acted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">legitimate self-defense.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused contends that his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">voluntary </span>surrender shows that he has nothing to hide and
attacks the delay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>reporting
the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"<u>Third</u>, </span>contrary
to appellant's claim, the fact that accused surrendered voluntarily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(p. 11, rec.) does not give rise to the
presumption that he had nothing to hide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the evidence of the prosecution, it is more plausible that accused
surrendered <span class="GramE">himself</span> because the evidence against </span>him
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">overwhelming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being at least four </span>(4) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">persons who witnessed the killing, accused
surrendered voluntarily, for there is no chance to escape his liability.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Fourth</u>, appellant contends that the prosecution
witnesses failed to report the incident right away, claiming that the wife of
the victim gave her statement to the police authority only on March 24, 1986
while prosecution witness Dominador Manayon gave his statement only after three
(should be four) days after the incident took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The long failure allegedly 'would indicate
that they never witnessed the incident as they have claimed during the trial.' <span class="GramE">(p. 8, <u>id</u>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention is specious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

any warning of its happening.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The unexpected assault (People v. Ventura, 80 SCRA 515) or
the attack which was sudden and unexpected (People v. Ursal, 121 SCRA 410) has
sufficiently proved the presence of treachery in the commission of the offense
‘as accused employed means and methods in the execution of the offense which
