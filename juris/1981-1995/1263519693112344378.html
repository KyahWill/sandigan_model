				<H3>ATAL MOSLEM AND AMADO MOSLEM, PETITIONERS,
VS. ANTONIO M. SORIANO, AND THE HONORABLE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF
TAGUM, DAVAO DEL NORTE, BRANCH VIII, SALA
I, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with
preliminary injunction to annul the orders and proceedings for contempt before
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Branch I at <span class="SpellE">Tagum</span>, in Civil Case No. 5788 for recovery of possession
and damages. The prayer that a writ of <i>mandamus</i> be issued directing the
respondent court to order the release of the petitioners appears premature
because the petitioners were not under detention at the time. Our temporary
restraining order also prevents the court's order of arrest from being
implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">Antonio M. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> filed Civil Case No.
5788 against <span class="SpellE">Atal</span> Moslem and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
Moslem to recover possession of four (4) hectares of land plus damages. In
their answer, the defendants specifically denied the material averments of the
com­plaint and contended that they entered and peacefully possessed for more
than twenty (20) years the area which was known as public land. The defendants
filed a counterclaim for P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> moral damages,
P2,000.00 exemplary, damages, and P1,000.00 attorney's fees.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the following transpired during the
pre-trial hearings:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the pre-trial that followed, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pangilan</span>,
who represents the defendants, and Atty. Fernando Contreras, who represents the
plaintiff, agreed to have Surveyor Jose <span class="SpellE">Vidua</span>
appointed Commissioner for the purpose of relocating the boundaries of the
land, subject matter of this complaint, the expenses to be borne by them share
and share alike. They also agreed that before relocation, they will deposit
with the <span class="GramE">Deputy Clerk of Court their share of the costs of
the survey.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defendants, through Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pangilan</span>,
also agreed that should the defendants be found within the land, subject matter
of this com­plaint, they will leave.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, surveyor Jose <span class="SpellE">Vidua</span> is
hereby appointed Com­missioner for the purpose of aforesaid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before entering into the performance of his duties, he shall
take an oath that he will faithfully perform his duties."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the commissioner submitted his report, it was found that
the defendants were within the land titled in the name of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.
It appears that <span class="SpellE">Atal</span> Moslem and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
Moslem interposed no objection to the report. The court, therefore, rendered a
decision ordering the petitioners to vacate the disputed land and pay the
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the judgment was being executed, the petitioners refused to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vacate </span>the land. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
filed a motion to declare them in contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, assisted by a new counsel, filed an opposition
to the motion. Resolving the motion after taking into account the opposition,
the respondent court issued an order, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the defendants are hereby found guilty of contempt and
ordered arrested and imprisoned until they obey the order aforementioned.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the order was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are now raising two issues for resolution, namely
-</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether petitioners can be declared in
contempt of court in a case for delivery of possession of real property.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether petitioners can be declared in
contempt of court pending payments of the improvements in the land under
Articles 448 and 546 of the New <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Civil </span>Code."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The arguments of the parties on whether or not the contempt order
is valid revolve around the question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>to
what section of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court applies in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that Section 8(d) of Rule 39 is
appropriate because the judgment requires delivery of real property. According
to them, the refusal to vacate the disputed land is not contempt of court
because the judgment is not a special judgment enforceable under Section 9 of
Rule 39. The respondents, however, argue that the order of the court is not to
deliver possession of land but to vacate it and to pay costs. They would apply
Section 9, Rule 39.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents' arguments are sophistic.</p>

<p class="BODY">A writ of execution under Section 8(d) requires the sheriff or
other proper officer to whom it is directed:<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">"(d) </span>If it be for the delivery of the
possession of real or personal property, to deliver the possession of the same,
describing it, to the party entitled thereto, and to satisfy any costs,
damages, rents, or profits covered by the judgment out of the personal property
of the person against whom it was rendered, and if sufficient personal property
cannot be found, then out of the real property." </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand,
Section 9, which the lower court ruled as applicable, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>Writ of execution of special judgment</u>.</span>
-- When a judgment requires the performance of any other act than the payment
of money, or the sale or delivery of real or personal property, a certified
copy of the judgment shall be attached to the writ of execution and shall be
served by the officer upon the party against whom the same is rendered, or upon
any other person required thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and such party
or person may be punished for contempt if he disobeys such judgment.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is plain from the
records that the judgment being enforced is an ordinary one. It is not a
special judgment. The case filed by Antonio M. </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
is an ordinary civil action for the recovery of possession of a parcel of land
and damages. The judgment directing the petitioner's to vacate the land is
nothing but a judgment to deliver possession of real property. A special
judgment under Section 9, Rule 39 is one which "requires the per<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">formance of any other act than the payment of
money, or the sale or delivery of real or personal </span>property.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">How is an ordinary
judgment enforced? Section 13 of Rule 39 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><u>How execution for the delivery or restitution of property
enforced</u>. -- The officer must enforce an execution for the delivery or
restitution of property by ousting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
person against whom the judgment is rendered and placing the judgment creditor
in possession of such property, and by levying as hereinafter provided upon so
much of the property of the judgment debtor as will satisfy the amount of the
judgment and costs included in the writ of execution.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We applied the above rule
in <u>Rom </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v. </span></u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Cobadora</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> (28 SCRA 758) and declared that the mere
refusal or unwillingness on the part of the defeated party to relinquish the
property would not constitute contempt. The proper procedure must be followed
in the execution of the judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Chinese Commercial
Company v. Martinez, et al.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
(6 SCRA 848) is clear that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Under Section 8(d) of Rule 39, if the judgment be for the delivery of the
possession of real property, the writ of execution must require the sheriff or
other officer to whom it must be directed to deliver the possession of the
property, describing it, to the party entitled thereto. <u>This means that the
sheriff must dispossess or eject the losing party from the premises and deliver
the possession thereof to the winning party. If subsequent to such
dispossession or <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> the losing party enters or
attempts to enter into or upon the real property, for the purpose of executing
acts of </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ownership or possession
or in any manner disturbs the possession of the person adjudged to be entitled
thereto, then and only then may the loser be charged with and punished for
contempt under paragraph (h) of Section 3, Rule 64</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A similar ruling was
rendered in <u>Fuentes, et al., v. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, et al</u>.,
(117 SCRA 958), where this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under Sec. 13, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, it is not
enough for the sheriff, in the enforcement of a judgment for delivery or
restitution of property, to merely direct the defeated party to <span class="GramE">effect</span> such delivery or restitution. The refusal of the
defeated party to surrender the property to the winning party upon the order of
the sheriff does not constitute contempt. The sheriff himself must oust the
defeated party from the property and effect the delivery or restitution by
placing the winning party in possession of the property (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Ramayat</span>, 22 Phil. 183)." x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Under the second issue in
this petition, the petitioners allege that they have entered, occu­pied, and
were in peaceful possession of the land in question which according to them was
public land, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for more than
twenty </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(20) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">years, and that their legal possession is
evidenced by Tax Declaration No. 3068 issued by the Office of the Provincial
Assessor on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">October 11, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1960. Having introduced considerable
improvements on the land in question before anybody laid claim to it, the
petitioners state that they are builders and planters in good faith and are
thus entitled to the retention of the improvements pending pay</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">m</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ent
under Articles 448 and 546 of the Civil Code. With this right of retention, the
petitioners contend that their refusal to vacate the premises cannot be
punished as contempt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The lower court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">did not find this explanation satisfactory.
The respondents have not discussed the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">builder in good faith
argument but have limi­ted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">themselves
to insisting that the refusal to vacate and to pay costs is <span class="SpellE">contemptous</span>
defiance of the court orders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The records of this case
are rather </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sketchy. The
petitioners did not submit any evidence to prove their assertions of being
builders and planters in good faith. The matter was not mentioned in their an­swer.
Only after they were required to show cause why they should not be held in
contempt did their new counsel explain that the petitioners had been in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">possession of the land since before World War
II, that under the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Civil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Code they are entitled to reimbursement of
all their improvements and that pending payment of said improvements, they
cannot be held </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in contempt of
court. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Without </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">explaining the basis of its ruling on this
point, the lower court found it unsatisfactory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Under ordinary
circumstances, the petitioners’ contentions on the second issue they raised
would not receive serious consideration. During </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">pre-</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">trial, their first
counsel agreed that a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">commissioner would survey the land and if
they are found within the property of the private respondent, they would leave.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There are special
reasons, however, why the builder in good faith issue should not be ignored or
considered closed <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">finality of the decision in the recovery of
possession case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the first place, the
petitioners have the presumption of good faith under Article 527 of the Civil
Code in their favor. In the drafting of the answer and during pre-trial, the
petitioners do not seem to have had the benefit of counsel, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the real meaning of its availability. The petitioners’ first counsel
limited the issues to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ascertaining
whether or not the two defendants were </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">inside the titled property of the plaintiff. <span class="SpellE">Atal</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> are </span>members of a cultural minority
group. They appear not even to have any surname. Their family name
"Moslem" appears to be more of a descriptive appellation than a
surname. There is nothing in the records before us to show whether or not <span class="SpellE">Atal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> were mere
squatters who entered land already titled in someone else's name. It is not
also shown whether the two were already working and cultivat­ing land which
they thought was public land when the same was titled by a person more
knowledgeable in acquisition of real estate. The builder in good faith argument
is, therefore, a valid one insofar as this contempt case is concerned. The
petitioners are not precluded from pursuing further legal steps to be
reimbursed for their improvements if their claim is supported by satisfactory
proof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the orders of the respondent court finding the
petitioners guilty of contempt and ordering their arrest and detention are
hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The temporary restraining order earlier issued
is made PERMANENT. <span class="GramE">Costs against the private respondent.</span></p>
