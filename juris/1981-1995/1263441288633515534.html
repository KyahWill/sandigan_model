				A.M. No. 91-8-374-OMB, November 28, 1994</h4>
				<H3>1ST ENDORSEMENT DATED JUNE 3, 1991 OF ATTY. DANILO CUNANAN, HEAD EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT, OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The administrative case before us stemmed from the unsworn-letter
complaint dated May 15, 1991 of Ms. Esperanza F. Choy against Rodrigo Saure,
Sheriff III, Regional Trial Court, Office of the Clerk of Court, Kalookan City,
for dereliction of duty, relative to the implementation of the writ of
execution issued in Civil Case No. 931, entitled "Esperanza F. Choy vs.
Nila Valencia", for Collection of <span style="">Sum
of Money.  The said unsworn
letter-complaint was originally filed with the Office of the Ombudsman but was
referred to this Court for appropriate action by Atty. Danilo Cunanan, Head
Executive Assistant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, the plaintiff in the aforecited case, alleges that
on January 31, 1991, Judge Nilo Barsaga, MTC, Masbate, Masbate issued an order
for the issuance of a writ of execution upon Nila Valencia and directed the
City Sheriff of Kalookan or any authorized deputies to serve the same to
satisfy a judgment for P2,400.00.  Respondent Saure was the one designated to enforce the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant claims that it was at her instance that the writ of
execution was served by respondent upon defendant Nila Valencia at her
residence at Lot 3, Block 4, Don Pepe Street, La Trinidad Subdivision,
Tenejeros, Malabon.  Although respondent
sheriff levied upon some of the defendant's personal property and scheduled the
auction sale on March 11, 1991, he did not, however, take physical possession
of the property levied upon.  The
auction sale did not materialize because herein complainant was not
available.  A second auction sale was
scheduled on April 23, 1991 but did not push through because the defendant was
not around and her house was padlocked.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of complainant that had respondent taken
physical possession of the levied personal property, the judgment would have
been satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant reiterated the foregoing allegations in her sworn
complaint submitted to this Court on October 14, 1991 in compliance with the
Resolution of the Court dated September 3, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment dated September 30, 1994, respondent sheriff, in
sum, alleges that:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Upon receipt of the writ of execution issued in Civil Case No.
931, together with the complainant, he proceeded to the residence of the
defendant.  There they were allegedly
informed that the defendant was not present due to her work in Masbate.  Considering that the defendant's son, Joel
Valencia, was there and he was of sufficient age and discretion, he
(respondent) explained to Joel the obligations of her mother and served upon
him a copy of the Writ of Execution, Notice of Levy, and Sheriff's Sale on the
property found inside their house;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The sale was scheduled for March 11, 1991 to give sufficient
time to the defendant to be notified and to appear during the public auction;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. At the scheduled sale, complainant was absent despite notice to
her and in view thereof the auction sale was postponed.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. On April 17, 1991, complainant informed him (respondent) that
there is no way of recovery and/or settlement of payment as she (complainant)
herself failed to contact defendant in Masbate.  Consequently, respondent and complainant proceeded again to the
defendant's residence and re-scheduled the public auction sale to April 23,
1991 at 10 o'clock in the morning and in the same address (referring to the
residence of defendant).  The respondent
likewise informed Joel of the re-scheduled auction sale.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. At the re-scheduled auction sale wherein barangay and police
assistance was sought, they were surprised to find the house of the defendant
unoccupied and padlocked.  Neighbors of
the defendant gave the information that the defendant was still in the province
and her children were in school.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. After finding it difficult to locate the whereabouts of the
defendant, respondent decided to look for another property and came up with a
piece of real property which is, however, mortgaged with the Development Bank
of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Thereafter, respondent explained to complainant the procedures
on the sale of real estate property which requires publication, greatly
disappointing, in the process, complainant.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. On April 26, 1991, a Sheriffs Report/Return was submitted to
the MTC, Masbate for record and information purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was then referred to <span style="">the Office of the </span>Court Administrator for evaluation, report,
and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his report dated November 26, 1994, Deputy Court Administrator
Reynaldo Suarez came up with the following findings and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>Rule 39, Section 15
of the Revised Rules of Court provides that:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Section 15.  Execution
of money judgments.- The officer must enforce an execution of a money judgment
by levying on all the property, real and personal of every name and nature
whatsoever, and which may be disposed of for value, of the judgment debtor not
exempt from execution, or on a sufficient amount of such property, if there be
sufficient, and selling the same, and paying to the judgment creditor, or his
attorney, so much of the proceeds as will satisfy the judgment.  Any excess in the proceeds over the judgment
and accruing costs must be delivered to the judgment debtor, unless otherwise
directed by the judgment or order of the court.  When there is more property of the judgment debtor than is
sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing costs, within the view of the
officer, he must levy only on such part of the property as is amply sufficient
to satisfy the judgment and costs.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">  Real property, stocks,
shares, debts, credits, and other personal property, or any interest in either
real or personal property, may be levied on in like manner and with like effect
as under a writ of attachment."</p>

<blockquote>Under the aforesaid rule, before the property may be sold on
execution, it must be levied on.  The
levy is indispensable to the validity of the execution sale.  There can be no valid sale without a valid
levy (Llenares vs. Valdeavelle, 46 Phil. 358).  Levy is in the nature of an attachment provided in Rule 57.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, it is very clear in the case at bar, that respondent Sheriff
is liable as charged.  While it is true
there has been a notice of levy and Sheriff's sale, the personal properties so
listed remained in the possession of the defendants and were never pulled out
even after it was scheduled twice for public auction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Admitted likewise is the fact that respondent submitted a Sheriff's
Report dated April 26, 1991.  The said
return has stated among others, that he has already conducted a levy on some of
the personal properties of defendant but the scheduled sale (twice) did not
materialize, first due to the absence of the complainant and secondly, due to
the fact that the house of the defendant was padlocked and the properties are
inside.  That in itself shows that
defendant failed to take custody of the personal properties which were levied
pursuant to the writ of execution issued by Judge Nilo B. Barsaga.  Respondent was therefore remiss in the
performance of his duty for having failed to take custody over the levied
properties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is a serious breach on the part of the Sheriff and he should
be meted a sterner penalty.  Since,
however, this is the first complaint ever filed against respondent in his long
years of service with the Court, a <span style="">light
penalty of a FINE of FIVE THOUSAND PESOS (P5.000.00) is commensurate </span>to
the gravity of the ?????.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the foregoing findings.  The sheriff is a court officer primarily
responsible for the speedy and efficient service of all court processes and
writs originating from his court and the branches thereof and those that may be
delegated to him from other courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">As such officer, whose duties form an integral part of the
administration of justice, a sheriff and his deputies may be properly dismissed
or suspended from office, by this tribunal which exercises administrative
supervision over the judicial branch of the government, for action committed in
violation of Rules of Court and which impedes and detracts from a fair and just
administration of justice (<u>Hipolito </u><u><span style="">vs. </span>Mergas</u>, 195 SCRA 6 [1991]).  The Court cannot overstress the need for circumspection and
proper behavior on the part of a sheriff, an officer of the court upon whom the
execution of a final judgment depends.  It is said that execution is the fruit and end of the suit and is very
aptly called the life of the law (<u>Tan vs. Herras</u>, 195 SCRA 1 [1991]; <u>PAL
vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 181 SCRA 557 [1990]).  It is indisputable that the most difficult phase of any
proceeding is the execution of judgment.  Hence, the officers charged with this delicate task must, in the absence
of a restraining order, act with considerable dispatch so as not to unduly
delay the administration of justice, otherwise, the decision, orders, or other
processes of the courts of justice would be futile (<u>Pascual vs. Duncan</u>,
216 SCRA 786 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had said before, and now reiterates it here, that the
conduct and behavior of every one connected with an office charged with the
dispensation of justice, from the highest magistrate to the lowest clerk,
should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Respondent sheriff's actuations in the
enforcement of the writ of execution in Civil Case No. 931 did not live up to
this strict standard.  The recommended
fine in the amount of P5,000.00, however, appears a bit too much considering
that the judgment credit in favor of complainant is only for P2,400.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, a fine of TWO THOUSAND PESOS (P2,000.00) is
hereby imposed on respondent sheriff Rodrigo Saure, payable within thirty (30)
days from notice.  Respondent is hereby
warned that a repetition of the same or of any act calling for disciplinary action,
will be dealt with more severely.</p>
