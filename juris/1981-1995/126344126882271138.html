				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In an information filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 5356 in
the Regional Trial Court, Branch 10, of Malaybalay, Bukidnon,
accused-appellants Leoniza Villagonzalo y Sarona and Renito Moro y Kinatagcan
were charged with murder for allegedly having conspired in the killing of one
Ricardo Tan with the <span style="">use </span>of an
illegally possessed homemade revolver loaded with an M-16 bullet.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> which
initiated the prosecution of this case was filed by the station commander of
the Pangantucan, Bukidnon police station on August 23, 1990 in the municipal
circuit trial court therein, and included two other respondents, Bano dela Cruz
and Joyjoy Asentista, but presumably because they were never apprehended, only
the herein appellants were charged in the information filed by the provincial
prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1990, appellants Leoniza Villagonzalo and Renito
Moro were arraigned and, with the assistance of counsel <i><span style="">de parte</span></i><span style="">, </span>pleaded not guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Trial
thereafter followed and, on January 30, 1992, the court below rendered judgment
convicting both appellants of the crime charged, and sentenced them to serve
the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="">, </span>with the accessory penalties
thereof, and to indemnify the heirs of the victim, jointly and severally, in
the amounts of P50,000.00 as death indemnity, P100,000.00 as moral damages, and
P25,000.00 as exemplary damages, with costs.  The case against the other two accused, Dela Cruz and Asentista, who are
still at large was ordered "archived to be revived when they are
arrested."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants now pray for the reversal of that judgment, the basic
thrust of their submission being that the lower court "erred in believing
prosecution witnesses Tito Alquizar and Presilla<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> Villarin
whose testimonies are patently false and palpably contrary to the experience of
mankind."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, as will hereafter be demonstrated, the ultimate disposition of this
case will turn on the credibility of these witnesses on whose twin declarations
the trial court anchored its verdict of guilt, and on the extent of the credit
this Court will extend to their testimonies.  <i><span style="">Apropos</span></i><span style=""> </span>thereto, the doctrinal guideposts
which jurisprudence yields for assaying the weight of testimony and the
findings of the trial court, vis-a-vis the presumption of innocence and the
burden of proof, will have to be carefully considered in calibrating on the
judicial scales the innocence which appellants profess.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidentiary presentation of the prosecution, collated from
and based on the testimonies of witnesses Villarin and Alquizar, is to the
effect that Ricardo Cordero Tan and appellant Leoniza Villagonzalo were
common-law spouses blessed with two young children, Arnold Cordero and Arthur
Cordero, and residents of Sitio Palo, Barangay Kimanait, in the town of
Pangantucan, Bukidnon.  Real and
personal properties of substantial value, primarily of agricultural nature or
purpose, were acquired by them during their cohabitation.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Moro was their tenant and a member of their farm household, Villarin
was a domestic helper, and Alquizar was both a helper and farmhand of the
spouses.  All of them were living
together with the spouses in the same house.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of August 16, 1990 while Villarin, Alquizar,
appellant Moro, and appellant Villagonzalo were untying sacks of corn at the
corn sheller in front of the <span style="">house of
the victim, Ricardo Tan, a certain Bano dela Cruz and one Joyjoy Asentista
arrived.  After some amenities and in
the presence of Villarin, Alquizar and appellant Moro, Dela Cruz and Asentista
forthwith discussed with Villagonzalo their plan to kill Tan.  Their conversation was interrupted when
Villagonzalo was called by Tan who </span>was <span style="">then inside the house.  Thereafter, the alleged hired killers spent the night in the house of
the mother of Villagonzalo, which was just across the road from the house of
Tan.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the early morning of
the following day, August 17, 1990, Villarin and Alquizar, together with Moro
and Villagonzalo, were again drying corn at the shelling place when Tan came
from the house.  On seeing Dela Cruz and
Asentista, although the records do not show his authority therefor, Tan
instructed them to help the other four persons in drying the corn.  Thereafter, he left for Don Carlos,
Bukidnon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Immediately after Tan had
left, Dela Cruz, Asentista and the two appellants, continued their discussion
of their plan for the killing of Tan.  Ultimately, a decision was reached in that Dela Cruz and Asentista would
be given P10,000.00 for the job, P2,000.00 of which was to be given after they
had killed Tan and the balance of P8,000.00 payable after the corn shall have
been sold.  Consequently, the firearm to
be used was delivered to Dela Cruz and Asentista by Moro upon the instructions
of Villagonzalo.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>All these acts were supposed to have
transpired in the presence of Alquizar and Villarin who were only two or three
meters away.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of the same day, a jeepney driver from Bukidnon
named Eddie Ramos passed by and informed Villagonzalo that Tan would not be
coming home until the following day.  That
information prompted Villagonzalo to take back from Dela Cruz and Asentista the
firearm earlier given to them.  However,
at around 3:30 o'clock of the same afternoon, Tan arrived from Don Carlos,
Bukidnon.  Later, the same firearm was
again delivered by Moro to Dela Cruz and Asentista among the coffee plants
behind the place where the corn sheller was located.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moro later returned with food which he got from the house and
gave it to Dela Cruz and Asentista who ate the same in the house of
Villagonzalo's mother.  Then, at around
7:00 P.M., Moro went back to the house and told Villagonzalo to give P2,000.00
to Alquizar, with the instruction that the money was to be handed to Dela Cruz
and Asentista after Tan had been killed.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At around 7:30 P.M., while the helpers and the two children of
Tan were taking their supper in the house, two gunshots were heard.  Alquizar, who had earlier gone to the coffee
plantation with the P2,000.00, gave the amount to Dela Cruz and Asentista who
had immediately approached him after the shots were fired.  The other people in the house went to the
place where the shots came from and they saw Ricardo Tan wounded, but he was
able to order Alquizar and Moro to procure a jeepney.  Unfortunately the two jeepneys that the latter tried to get were
not in running condition.  Shortly
thereafter, Ricardo Tan died and was later brought into the house.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The question of motive was sought to be answered by the
prosecution through the testimonies likewise of Villarin and Alquizar.  These prosecution witnesses testified that
Villagonzalo and Moro were paramours, despite the fact that they were
respectively 35 and 17 years old.  The
two witnesses claimed that they had both seen the couple in the act of sexual
intercourse on a number of occasions.  From
this it was postulated that because of their desire to live together, they
decided to have Ricardo Tan eliminated.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Villagonzalo stoutly denied any participation in the
plot and subsequent assassination of the victim, her common-law husband.  In fact, she completely denied the
occurrence of any of the supposed events of August 16 and 17, 1990 wherein she
and her co-appellant allegedly met for conspiratorial purposes with Dela Cruz
and Asentista.  She claimed that at
around 7:00 to 7:30 P.M. of August 17, 1990, while she and Ricardo Tan were
already in bed, they heard the dogs furiously barking near the corn sheller
which was about 20 meters away from the house.  Thinking that there were burglars, Tan went down to the shelling
place.  A few minutes later, she heard <span style="">a </span>gunshot and almost simultaneously
heard the victim calling her, saying that he had been shot.  She ran towards the drier behind the sheller
where the shot came from, followed by her two children, Villarin and Moro.  She ordered Moro to get a jeepney so that
they could bring the victim to the hospital.  Unfortunately, no operational jeepney was available.  Shortly thereafter, Ricardo Tan died while
he was cradled on her lap.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, two policemen came and made a verbal investigation
regarding the shooting incident.  On
August 21, 1990, Moro and Alquizar were taken by policemen and brought to
Pangantucan as suspects in the death of Tan.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> It
does not appear that Villagonzalo was apprehended or asked to submit to <span style="">a </span>formal investigation, nor was her
testimony taken down in writing by the police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Villagonzalo further testified that on August 23, 1990, while she
was sleeping with her son, Arthur, the latter woke her up, saying, "Mama,
be aware because they will kill you." Seeing two men near the open door,
she jumped out of the window and ran to the house of her half-sister, Rosita
Mendoza.  The two men, whom she later
claimed were nephews of the victim, pursued her there but left after they were
denied entry to the house.  After the
men had left, Villagonzalo and her sister rushed to the house of <i>B</i><i><span style="">arangay</span></i><span style=""> </span>Captain Bartolome Sabado where they were eventually admitted by
his wife.  However, the two men followed
her there but they were not allowed to enter the house by the aforesaid wife of
the <i><span style="">barangay</span></i><span style=""> </span>captain.  When the <i><span style="">barangay</span></i><span style=""> </span>captain arrived that evening, she
related the incident to him.  The
following morning, at her request, he escorted her in the company of some
members of the Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) to
Pangantucan.  There, for her safety, she
was placed inside the jail, where she saw Moro and Alquizar who were also
confined therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
incident, and the time appellant ran to her sister's house until they sought
refuge in the house of the <i><span style="">barangay</span></i><span style=""> </span>captain, were corroborated by Rosita
Mendoza.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Moro absolutely denied all the allegations of Villarin
and Alquizar about the visit of Dela Cruz and Asentista in the afternoon of
August 16, 1990, the supposed plotting for the killing of Ricardo Tan which the
two prosecution witnesses had testified to as earlier narrated, their
imputation that Moro had given the gun twice to the alleged killers, that he
had further participated by providing them food, and how he later arranged for
the giving of the P2,000.00 to them through Alquizar.  He pointed out that Alquizar was not with them when they rushed
to the aid of the victim as he lay wounded, and that it was he alone who was
asked to look for a jeep to bring the victim to the hospital.  He explained that he does not know, or even
for once saw, the persons now identified as Dela Cruz and Asentista, and that
in the morning of August 17, 1990, they were not even at the corn shelling area
but were all actually harvesting corn in the farm about 200 meters from the
house.  He denied having had any sexual
liaison with his co-appellant, and he in fact considered the spouses as his
parents.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Moro also testified that while he was in jail, Rolando
Tan, a brother of the victim, came to ask him to testify falsely against
Villagonzalo but he turned him down as he had no knowledge of the
incident.  Rolando Tan then approached
Alquizar for the same purpose and, after some discussion, the latter eventually
agreed provided that he would be released from jail.  They also agreed that Rolando Tan would provide Alguizar with a
piece of land to work on, without the former getting the owner's share from the
produce therefrom.  Afterwards, Alguizar
was released from detention.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> This
testimony of appellant Moro was never challenged or refuted by Alguizar and the
only rebuttal testimony on this aspect was that of Pat. Paterno Cosmo who
merely stated that Alquizar made his affidavit voluntarily and was not
contacted by Rolando Tan, and of Rolando Tan who just denied having talked to
Alquizar.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Arguably, there is no presumption more highly favored in the law
than that of innocence.  The presumption
of innocence is founded upon the first principles of justice and is not a mere
form, but a substantial part of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> In our
jurisdiction, as in most civilized countries, this presumption does not only
have statutory basis but occupies an elevated and constitutional position by
being firmly ensconced in the Bill of Rights, the so-called constitution of
liberty, and, as a restriction on governmental power, the same may be
overthrown only by the stringent quantum of evidence beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Complementarily, it has
been an unswerving jurisprudential course, of such long standing and fixed
consistency as to eliminate the need for citations, that to rebut the
presumption of innocence not only is the burden squarely laid on the
prosecution but that it must do so on the strength of its own evidence without
seeking to rely upon or even invoke what it may claim is a weakness of that </span>of
the defense.  This is but an inevitable
and logical consequence since he who alleges must prove his allegations, hence
the prosecution may not avail of any evidential position of the defense which,
in the first place, is not even bound to go forward with evidence until the
presumptive wall of innocence appears to have been breached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, a rule
approximating theological dogma is that the findings of the trial court on the
issue of credibility of witnesses and their testimonies are entitled to great
respect and accorded the highest consideration by appellate courts, and is </span>a
matter <span style="">peculiarly within the province
of the trial judge who had </span>the opportunity to observe the demeanor and
behavior of both the prosecution and the defense witnesses at the time of their
testimony.  But this rule <span style="">is </span>not without exception.  Thus, it does not apply where the lower
court overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered,
would affect the result of the case.  Consequently, this Court <span style="">is </span>not
bound by the factual findings of the lower court which are contradicted by the
evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Stated in another way, the above-cited rule which would accord
deference to the factual findings of the court below yields whenever the
findings do not conform to the evidence on record and appear to have no valid
basis to sustain their correctness.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> That
lack of basal support may arise as a conclusion not only from the import of the
testimonies given but, just as importantly, also from their inherent improbability,
their non-adherence to the common experience of mankind of which courts may
take judicial cognizance, and other tell-tale indications of fabrication
evident on or inferable from the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, a little background check on these two witnesses shows that
Alquizar was taken into the employ of the spouses sometime before November,
1989<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
while Villarin became their helper on November 6, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
There is nothing in the record to show that from that brief period of <span style="">employment, they enjoyed or had merited the
confidence of either of the spouses beyond the ordinary rapport between master
and servant.  These two became
sweethearts before the fatal incident in this case and, after Alquizar was
released from detention, they got married.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Alquizar was 16 years old and while his
educational attainment is not revealed, he can at least sign his name, while
Villarin was 14 years old and had finished the third grade.  At the time they testified in 1991, Villarin
was already residing at Tina, </span><span style="">Badiangan,
Iloilo,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
residence of the parents of the victim, while Alquizar was living with Rolando
Tan who had taken over the house and properties of the deceased.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Analyzing the testimonies
of these witnesses, these facts stand out in bold relief:  (1) Their detailed narration that they were
both present, witnessed and heard everything involved in the events antecedent
to the shooting of the victim, that is, the arrival of the two killers in the
afternoon of August 16, 1990 and the discussions on the conditions and
consideration for the dastardly act; the delivery of the gun to them by
appellant Moro in the morning of August 17, 1990; the retrieval of the gun from
them by appellant Villagonzalo that afternoon; the redelivery of the gun to
them later that afternoon by appellant Moro in the coffee plantation; the
giving of food to them by appellant Moro which he took from the house of the
spouses; and the delivery of the P2,000.00 to Alquizar in the house by
appellant Villagonzalo at the instance of appellant Moro; </span>and (2) The
almost perfect dovetailing in their testimonies on virtually all aspects, which
is an indubitable proof of coached and rehearsed testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed an incredible possibility that all the events
leading to the killing of the victim were made known to these two witnesses for
no apparent reason.  As already stated,
there was absolutely no reason why the supposed four plotters of murder would
unrestrainedly discuss the details thereof right before these two witnesses who
sustained no confidential relation with them, especially on so heinous a matter
as the taking of the life of their employer who admittedly had been good to
them.  Conspiracies of this nature, or
of even lesser offenses, are hatched in secrecy and the weapons therefor are
provided clandestinely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consider the sheer effrontery of this testimony of Alquizar:</p>

<p class="BODY">Witness Villarin had never volunteered to give any information to
the police authorities since, according to her, she revealed what she allegedly
knew only in November, 1990 when she talked to the private prosecutor, Atty.

She was obviously placed on the stand to corroborate the testimony of her new
husband, Alquizar, with the advantage that she could not be challenged for
having given prior inconsistent testimony.  The trouble is that, providentially, in her enthusiasm to sustain her
husband's version of the events, she overplayed her hand by attempting to give
such corroboration up to the minutest details, although it was evident that it
was impossible for her to have been in a position to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">In almost flawless corroboration, Villarin recited:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  When Joyjoy Asentista and Bano dela Cruz
arrived and went to the shelling place together with Leoniza Villagonzalo,
Renito Moro, witness Tito and yourself, what happened?</blockquote>

(Corrections in parentheses supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is undeniable that the aforequoted declaration of Villarin,
which sounds like a tape-recorded duplication, is the product of prior
tutoring, and the reason is simple.  For
Alquizar himself unwittingly revealed that in the aforementioned incident at
4:30 P.M. of August 16, 1990, his wife, Prescilda Villarin, was not present
since she was in the house; and, in answer to the follow-up question of the
trial court, he categorically admitted that his companions on that occasion
were only Asentista, Dela Cruz and Villagonzalo.<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This case exemplifies the oft-quoted truism that evidence to be
believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, which is
here already in serious doubt, but must be credible in itself.  No better test has yet been found to measure
the value and weight of a witness' testimony than its conformity to the
knowledge and common experience of mankind.  The Court, therefore, cannot give the testimonies of Alquizar and
Villarin the same credence as that extended by the court below, despite the
entrenched rule that accords great weight to the trial court's findings of
fact.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, when the witnesses' testimonies are congruent even down
to the minutiae, there arises a very strong presumption that not only were
these witnesses briefed beforehand about the questions to be propounded during
the trial but that the witnesses were likewise trained to give answers that
would parallel the version of the other witnesses of the prosecution.  In such a case, the witnesses no longer
speak from memory or experience.  Their
testimonies have thereby become fabrications, hence they forfeit their
probative value,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
with the result that the presumption of innocence enjoyed by appellants must be
maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have just recently ruled that in our criminal justice system,
the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of
the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, we have long held that if the inculpatory facts and
circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his
guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is
not sufficient to support a conviction.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Conviction should be made on the basis of strong, clear and compelling
evidence, and it would be tragic to have the fate of herein appellants rest
upon tainted evidence concocted from the frailty of man when obfuscated by
avarice.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to conspiracy, it must be established by the same quantum of
evidence as any other ingredient of the offense.  The same degree of proof necessary to establish the crime <span style="">is </span>required to establish a finding of
criminal conspiracy, that is, proof beyond reasonable doubt.  It cannot be established by conjectures but
by positive and conclusive evidence.  Since
conspiracy must be proved beyond peradventure of <span style="">a </span>doubt, it cannot be appreciated where the facts can be
consistent with the non-participation of the accused in the fancied cabal.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, it is insinuated that appellant Villagonzalo, as the
common-law wife of the deceased, should have immediately reported the matter to
the police.  Said appellant cannot be
faulted for the overnight delay.  People
react in many different ways when faced with <span style="">a </span>tragic occurrence, especially when it concerns a loved
one.  Delay in relating to the
authorities the attendant facts of the crime for which the accused had been
charged <span style="">is </span>consistent with the
normal behavior after a tragic incident, since the last thing that the bereaved
would want to happen is to provoke reprisal from the perpetrators of the
felonious act.  Although there is a
natural tendency to seek justice for the treacherous killing of a dearly
departed, mourning and the rites for the dead take priority in our culture.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>
