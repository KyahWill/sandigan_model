</span>Later, the jurisdiction over the disposition and acquisition of landed

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1965, one unit of the 3-door <span class="SpellE"><u>accessoria</u></span>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in December, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>,
in her capacity <span style="">as </span>judicial
guardian of <span class="SpellE">Escarte</span>, Jr., filed <span style="">a </span>petition for authority to sell the
subject lot before the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila, where
the guardianship proceeding was pending.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was granted by the court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1971</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> requested the consent of the Land Authority

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1971" day="26" month="4"><span style="">April
 26, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Medina</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> filed a protest which was originally
instituted before the Land Authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the transfer of the functions of the Land Authority to the
Department of Agrarian Reform, Medina filed an amended protest, seeking the
cancellation of the contract of sale over the subject lot executed by the Land
Authority in favor of <span class="SpellE">Escarte</span>, Jr., as well as the
deed of sale over the same lot in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Villanuevas</span>
and prayed for the sale of the lot to himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the records of the case </span>were <span style="">transferred to </span>the <span style="">National
Housing Authority (NHA) pursuant to the provisions of Presidential Decree No.
757.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December 14, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the NHA resolved to dismiss the protest,
rationalizing, </span><u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,<span style=""> as follows (p. 58, </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"We find the contention of the protestant that he had a
preferential right to purchase the property to be untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By his own admission and as found out by the
Court of First Instance of Manila in its decision in Civil Case No. 83215, and
also by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch, in its decision in Civil Case No.
Q-15952, the protestant was merely a lessee of a unit or one door of the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">accessoria</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Therefore,
he could not be considered as a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> tenant or occupant of
the lot as contemplated in Commonwealth Act No. 539."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> appealed to
the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1980</st1:date>, the said Office
rendered its decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which, reads (p. 40, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Office hereby (a) sets aside the resolution
of the National Housing Authority, dated December 14, 1978; (b) cancels the
deed of sale over Lot 3, <span style="">Block 2, <span class="SpellE">Sande</span> Estate, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila,
executed by the Land Tenure Administration in favor of Santiago <span class="SpellE">Escarte</span>, Jr., as well as the authority granted by the Land

(d) awards said lot to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> D. Medina.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1981</st1:date>, the motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioners was denied for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue is who is entitled to the subject lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are several grounds alleged by
petitioners in support of this petition, but one will suffice to dispose
thereof, that is, the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners submit that <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>'s
status relative to the subject lot had since been settled by final <span style="">court </span>pronouncements, namely, Civil
Case No. 83215 of the Court of First Instance of Manila and Civil Case No.
Q-15952 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
which held that he is not a <u>bona</u> <u><span style="">fide</span></u><span style=""> </span>tenant
or occupant thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, he is
now barred from being considered as such and not legally entitled to challenge
petitioners' titles much less be entitled to the award, on the basis of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span> (pp. 20-24, Brief for Petitioners; p. 242, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Medina contends that Civil Case No. 83215 <span style="">has </span>no applicability:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) as subsequent proceedings thereafter took
place investigating the illegal issuance of title to petitioners; 2) the issue
of illegal issuance of title was not raised therein; 3) there was no trial on
the merits because the case was decided on a motion to dismiss; 4) there was no
formal presentation or reception of evidence; and 5) an order, not a decision,
was issued by the trial court (pp. 68- 69, Reply Brief for Private Respondent;
p. 248, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Agreeing with <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>,
the respondent Office said (p. 38, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"On the claim of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> by the <span class="SpellE">protestees</span>,
this Office finds this untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
if there were court decisions, which there was none, raising the point squarely
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We sustain petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent Office when it ruled in
favor of <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>, in complete
disregard of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE">j<u>udicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under this principle, an existing final judgment or decree rendered upon
the merits, by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a matter within its
jurisdiction, is conclusive of the rights of the parties and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with them, in all other actions or suits in the
same or any other tribunal not only on the points and matters in issue in the
first suit, but as to any other issues which might have been raised therein for
the purpose of the claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 83215 (pp. 85-89, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>),
<st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> and a certain <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> filed a complaint
against <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>,

better right thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1971</st1:date>, the trial court

<p class="2Q">‘Moreover, since defendant entered into a contract of lease with

said portion pursuant to the provisions of Section 68 (b), Rule 123, of the
Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court <span style="">well </span>observed:</p>

failure to pay the rent gave the plaintiff the right to terminate the lease and

<p class="2Q">'Section 15. - <u>Definition</u> <u>of</u> <u>Bona-Fide</u> <u>Tenant</u>;
<u>Bona-Fide</u> <u>Occupant</u> - For the purpose of these rules and
regulations, and more specifically of the succeeding section, a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
tenant in a land acquired by the government is one who occupies or actually
possesses a certain area thereof by virtue of an express or implied contract of
tenancy had with the former owner of the land from whom it was acquired by the
government and continuous (sic) to be a tenant of the said area at the time he
files his application to purchase the same or a portion thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupant in a land
acquired by the government is one who, not being a registered tenant, occupies
in good faith a certain area thereof at the time for the acquisition of said
land by the government, <span style="">or </span>one
who has been in continuous occupation of said area for at least two (2) years
immediately prior to the said acquisition by the government and had cultivated
the same during said period of time and/or had introduced improvements thereon
for which he had paid taxes to the government; and continues to be an occupant of

were not a lessee, he was not a tenant or an occupant of the PROPERTY at the
time the PROPERTY was acquired by the Government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a lessee, plaintiff Medina has the obligation to return
the demised premises after the expiration of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If plaintiff Medina had complied with the
demand to vacate made on him by the VILLANUEVA CHILDREN, he would instantly
lose all semblance of ‘occupancy’.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court cannot concede that he has any right at all to be the original grantee of
the Government, in respect of the PROPERTY, nor to have a right to have the
present title transferred to him under the theory of trust."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Medina questioned the dismissal of the
complaint before this Court by way of a petition for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
which was denied for lack of merit on September 17, 1971 (p. 91, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
entry of judgment was made on October 19, 1971 (p. 92, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this ruling constitutes an
absolute bar to the present case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) it
was final; b) it was a judgment on the merits; c) it was rendered by a court
having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; and d) there is,
between the first and the present actions, identity of parties, subject matter
and cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">While We agree with Medina that in Civil Case No. 83215, there
was no trial on the merits because the case was decided on a motion to dismiss,
there was no formal presentation or reception of evidence and an order, not a
decision, was issued by the trial court, still, the ruling was a judgment on
the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a technical legal term,
"merits" has been defined in law dictionaries as matter of substance
in law, as distinguished from matter of form, and as the real or substantial
grounds of action or defense, in contradistinction to some technical or
collateral matter raised <span style="">in </span>the
course of the suit. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>A judgment is upon
the merits when it amounts to a declaration of the law as to the respective
rights and duties of the parties, based upon the ultimate fact or state of
facts disclosed by the pleadings and evidence, and upon which the right of
recovery depends, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections or
contentions (Vicente J. Francisco, Revised Rules of Court, Volume II, pp.
841-842).</p>

<p class="BODY">The principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> is an old axiom of the law, dictated by
wisdom and sanctified by age, and is founded on the broad principle that it is
to the interest of the public that there should be an end to litigation by the
same parties and their privies over a subject once fully and fairly
adjudicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the very object of
instituting courts of justice is that litigation should be decided, and decided
finally, for human life <span style="">is </span>not
long enough to allow of matters once disposed of being brought under discussion
again (Fernandez v. <span class="SpellE">Sebido</span>, et al., 70 Phil. 151).</p>

<p class="BODY">The order in Civil Case No. Q-15952 (pp. 93-95, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) which likewise held that Medina was not a <u>bona</u>
<u>fide</u> tenant or occupant of the subject lot cannot be said to constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to the
present case because there is no identity of parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint therein was filed by Medina against
the Land Authority Governor.</p>
