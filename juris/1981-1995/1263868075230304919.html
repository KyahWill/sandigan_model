				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, petitioners
seek to nullify the decision dated 30 April 1979 of the then Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila, Branch XXI, in Civil Case No.
113897, which affirmed the decisions <span style="">of </span>the
Presidential Assistant for Legal Affairs and the then Minister of Natural
Resources giving due course to the Miscellaneous Sales Applications filed by
private respondents with the Bureau of Lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant factual and procedural antecedents which gave rise
to this petition as gathered from the pleadings are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 December 1965, private respondent Federico <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Sr., filed with the Bureau of Lands Miscellaneous
Sales Application (MSA) No. (V-3)2 over a 4,172 square meter parcel of land
located at San Patricio, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 18 February 1966, his son, respondent <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Jr., filed MSA No. (V-3)1 over an adjoining lot
with an area of 1,358 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the Director of Lands approved the survey plans of these
two (2) <span class="SpellE">MSAs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 February 1966, Land Investigator Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> conducted a preliminary investigation of the
parcels of land covered by the above <span class="SpellE">MSAs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He reported that <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>,
Sr. had introduced improvements consisting of a residential house, a piggery
house and a bodega all <span class="GramE">valued</span> at P25,500.00; <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, <span style="">Jr. </span>had
introduced an improvement consisting of a residential house valued at
P15,000.00; and that they have been occupying the parcels applied for since
1947.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
recommended that the <span class="SpellE">MSAs</span> be given further due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">MSAs</span> were referred to the Director
of Public Works, the Commissioner of Public Highways, the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City Engineer and the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City Collector of
Customs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These officials did not
interpose any objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands approved the surveys of the parcels applied
for on 26 July 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 September 1967, <span style="">notices
</span>for the sale through public auction of the lots in question were posted
at the required places and published in the 13 and 20 November 1967 issues of
the Official Gazette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale
was <span style="">set </span>for 27 December 1967 at
10:00 o’clock in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Undersecretary of Natural Resources pegged the price of the lots in question at
P5.00 per square meter.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the auction sale, private respondents were the only qualified
bidders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>,
<span style="">Sr.’s </span>bid was P20<span class="GramE">,860.00</span> while that of <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jr.’s</span> was P6,790.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They paid the required 10% of their respective bids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the purchase price and the
corresponding annual real estate taxes have already been fully paid, the Bureau
of Lands has <span style="">yet </span>to issue an
Order awarding the lots in question to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 March 1968, District Land Officer Pedro C. Reyes ordered an
investigation of an alleged conflict (docketed as D.L.O. Conflict <span class="GramE">No</span>. <span class="GramE">(V-3)220 (N)) between <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Sr.’s MSA No.</span> <span class="GramE">(V-3)2 and

Permit Application (RPA) of a certain <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Donozo</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On 2 April 1968, another investigation of an alleged conflict
(docketed as B.L. Conflict No. 217(N)) between <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Jr.’s</span> MSA No.</span> (V-3)1 and the <span class="SpellE">RPAs</span> of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Agura</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alib</span>, and Sta. Rita and a certain Domingo <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> was ordered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Land Investigator Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Siriban</span>
conducted a preliminary investigation of B.L. Conflict No. 217(N).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his report dated 20 April 1968, he stated:</p>

<blockquote>“That the land subject hereof used to be foreshore but is now <span class="SpellE">dryland</span> and is being used for residential purposes by the
party litigants and their respective tenants and relatives;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That upon verification of the premises, it was found out that the
area applied for and occupied by the Applicants-Contestants are inside the area
applied for and surveyed for the Applicant-Respondent x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY">In his report, <span class="SpellE">Siriban</span> made no mention
of D.L.O. Conflict No. <span class="GramE">(V-3)220(N).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He advised the contending parties in B.L.
Conflict No. 217(N) to submit <span style="">to </span>a
formal investigation so that their respective claims can be threshed out.</p>

<p class="BODY">A formal investigation was then conducted by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Villamarzo</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City
District Land Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three (3) formal
hearings were held in May, June and 19 September 1969.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, however, <span class="SpellE">Villamarzo</span>
failed to submit either the stenographic notes or the report on what transpired
during these <span style="">hearings, except </span>the
one held on 19 September 1969 wherein he stated that for failure of herein
respondents to appear, he had to reset the hearings to 27, 28, and 29 of
November 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, petitioners <span class="SpellE">Agura</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alib</span>, Sta. Rita and 106 others sent to the President of the
Philippines a petition dated 22 August 1969 requesting that the small parcels
of land located in the areas covered by private respondents’ <span class="SpellE">MSAs</span> which they have been occupying for thirty (30) years
be awarded to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this
petition, Regional Land Officer <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> of Region V, Iloilo City was ordered to conduct an
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 October 1969, <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> submitted
the following preliminary report:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“The land subject of the present controversy is now a dry land
which has been formed by accretions from the sea (<span class="SpellE">Guimaras</span>

survey plan and is being claimed by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Sr.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The <span class="SpellE">Serfinos</span> have houses on the land in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, all other portions
of the land in question are covered with houses mostly of <span class="SpellE">nipa</span>
roofing and of light materials belonging to the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an artesian well now being used by
the people therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several old coconut

defendants therein from the lots in question for “failure to pay rentals.” On
22 August 1970, Civil Cases Nos. 6534 and 6674 were dismissed on the ground
that “the question of who has a better right to the areas claimed by the

possession of the por<span style="">t</span>ions

is hereby SET ASIDE, and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> are hereby
ordered to vacate the two lots in question within thirty (30) days from receipt

<p class="BODY">In support of this disposition, the Secretary made the following
findings of facts and conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>“The principal issue is whether or not the sales of the lots in
question in favor of the appellants (private respondents) should be revoked in
view of the alleged conflicts and adverse claims of the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
(petitioners).</blockquote>

<blockquote>We find no basis for an affirmative answer to this issue
considering that the basic facts remain <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The records show that the required notices were posted in
accordance with law on <st1:date year="1967" day="28" month="9">September 28,
 1967</st1:date>, at the required places for the sale through public auction of
the lots in question on <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="12">December 27,
 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The notices were
likewise published in the Official Gazette on <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1967</st1:date>, and on <st1:date year="1967" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="12">December 27, 1967</st1:date>,
no other bids having been admitted, except those of the appellants, their bids
were accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then, the
appellants have fully paid the amounts respectively <span class="SpellE">bidded</span>
by them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P20<span class="GramE">,860.00</span>
for Federico <span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Sr., and P6,790.00 for Federico
<span class="SpellE">Serfino</span>, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants have also declared the said lots for taxation purposes with
the City Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> and have been
religiously paying their taxes thereon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ordinarily, the Order of award and the corresponding authority to
enter follow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no such order of award
in favor of the appellants has yet been issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were there supervening events that could have prevented the Bureau from
giving the award to the appellants? <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If
so, did these supervening events constitute a bar to an award of the contested
lots?</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the records of this case, there were allegedly two supervening
events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, there were the alleged
conflicts between the Miscellaneous Sales Applications of the appellants and
Revocable Permit Applications of the five <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second were the adverse claims of these
five <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and 105 others filed on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1969</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under Land Administrative Order No. 6, a conflict refers to a
protest made by a public land applicant who believes that another applicant or
any other person is encroaching upon the land applied for by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it is essential that the
protestant must be a public land applicant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> never filed any regular land
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did, however, file
revocable permit applications, but these were never approved by the Bureau of
Lands as reflected in the questioned Order of the Director of Lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">The</span> <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
therefore have not acquired any right whatsoever over the lots in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside (sic) such mere filing
did not create an obligation on the part of the Bureau of Lands to grant their
applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
It is discretionary on the part of said officials to grant or not to grant such
applicants.’ <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Aureus</span> vs. Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources, 85 Phil. 1, November 11, 1949).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The case took on a different aspect when the five <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> and 105 others sent a letter-protest to the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1969</st1:date>,
requesting that the contested areas, which they have allegedly occupied for
more than thirty (30) years, be awarded to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done even while the formal
investigation before <span class="SpellE">Villamarzo</span> on the alleged
conflicts was still pending.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, no
investigation at all was ever done by <span class="SpellE">Villamarzo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
turned the alleged conflicts into adverse claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again under Lands Administrative Order No. 6, an adverse claim
refers to the verified protest filed whereby a person asserts a right over a
land covered by a public land application, based on his alleged ownership or on
his prior right to apply for the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Obviously, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> cannot base their
adverse claim on the ground of ownership since the contested lots belong to the
public domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule
that no public land can be acquired by private persons without a grant, express
or implied, from the Government (Padilla vs. Reyes, 60 Phil. 967), x <span class="SpellE">x</span> However, a mere allegation by the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
that they have been in occupation of certain portions of the public domain for
more than 30 years is not sufficient to confer ownership on (sic) said public
lands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> herein failed to protest when
the appellants filed their respective sales applications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did they protest when the land <span class="GramE">was surveyed</span> nor did they contest or participate in the
public bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>
took nearly two years after the bidding to file their alleged adverse claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The basic facts remain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Bureau decided to sell the contested lots through public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the public bidding was indeed held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior possession is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In proceedings for the sale of public lands
for residential purposes, adjudication shall be made to the highest
bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellants herein have substantially complied with the sales
provisions of the Public Land Act, whereas the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
failed to exercise their rights when they did not participate in the public
bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They therefore could not invoke

<p class="BODY">On appeal by herein petitioners, the Presidential Assistant for

affirmed <i><u><span style="">i</span>n</u></i> <span class="SpellE"><i><u>toto</u></i></span> the foregoing decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In affirming the Secretary’s decision, the Office of the
President held as without merit the contentions of petitioners that the land in
question is foreshore and cannot therefore be disposed of by sale but only by
lease pursuant to Section 61, in relation to Section 59 of the Public Land Act,
and that if at all it could be disposed of by sale, purchasers are limited to
1,000 square meters pursuant to R.A. No. 730, and that the decision appealed
from renders nugatory the social justice policy of the New Society as it would
result in the eviction and dislocation of more than 100 occupants of the area
who have been there for more than thirty (30) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the Director of Lands of <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="7">6 July 1971</st1:date> favoring the petitioners
characterized the land as having been formed by accretion from the <span class="GramE">sea,</span> hence it is not foreshore land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sales in question were perfected by
public auction, held and conducted pursuant to Section 60, in relation to
Section 26 of the Public Land Act, and not through private sales; hence, R.A.
No. 730 has no application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the
third contention, the Office <span style="">of </span>the
President concluded that from the facts established, the petitioners were able
to enter the land after the <span class="SpellE">Serfinos</span> purchased the
land by public bidding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The social
justice policy of the New Society does not condone, much less countenance,
entry upon public lands already applied for and purchased at public auction;
otherwise, <span class="GramE">it</span> would be placing a premium on squatting.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Lacuesta</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>vs.</u> <u>Herrera</u>, this Court
categorically declared:</p>

<blockquote>“The petition must therefore be granted on the strength of the
established doctrine that where as in this case at bar there is no showing that
there was fraud, collusion, arbitrariness, illegality, imposition or mistake <span style="">on </span>the part of the Office of the
President or a department head, (such as the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources in the present case), in rendering their questioned decisions or of a
total lack of substantial evidence to support the same, such administrative
decisions are entitled to great weight and respect and will not be interfered
with by the courts.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, both the Secretary of Natural Resources and
the Office of the President made a thorough and painstaking analysis and
evaluation of the facts and their respective decisions are clearly supported by
substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
in their actuations that would bring their findings and decisions within the
above exceptions to the principle of conclusiveness of finding of facts of
administrative bodies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
trial court, which nevertheless patiently and carefully summarized the facts,
did not commit the first and second alleged errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The third and fourth assigned errors are likewise untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the ruling of the respondent court that R.A. No.
730 does not repeal or amend Sections 61 and 67 of C.A. No. 141 (The Public
Land Act); it merely establishes an exception to said sections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 61 of the Public Land Act provides:</p>

<blockquote>“The lands comprised in classes (a), (b), and (c) of section
fifty-nine shall be disposed of to private parties by lease only and not
otherwise, as soon as the President, upon recommendation by the Secretary of
Agriculture, shall declare that the same are not necessary for the public
service and are open to disposition under this chapter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lands included in class (d) may be disposed
of by sale or lease under the provisions of this <span style="">A</span>ct.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 67 provides:</p>

<blockquote>“The lease or sale shall be made through oral bidding, and
adjudication shall be made to the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, where an applicant has made
improvements on the land by virtue of a permit issued to him by competent
authority, the sale or lease shall be made by sealed bidding as prescribed in
section twenty-six of this Act, the provisions of which shall be applied
wherever applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If all or part of
the lots remain <span class="SpellE">unleased</span> or unsold, the Director of
Lands shall from time to time announce in the Official Gazette or in any other
newspapers of general circulation, the lease or sale of those lots, if
necessary.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 59 reads:</p>

<blockquote>“The lands disposable under this title shall be classified as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">a) Lands reclaimed by the Government by
dredging, filling, or other means;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">b) Foreshore;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">c) Marshy lands or lands covered with
water bordering upon the shores or banks of navigable lakes or rivers;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">d) Lands not included in any of the
foregoing classes.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The land in question belongs to class (d).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Section 1 of Republic Act No. 730 (“An Act To
Permit The Sale Without Public Auction Of Public Lands Of The Republic Of The
Philippines For Residential Purposes To Qualified Applicants Under Certain
Conditions”) provides that:</p>

<blockquote>“Notwithstanding the provisions of sections sixty-one and sixty
seven of Commonwealth Act Numbered One Hundred Forty-one, as amended by
Republic Act Numbered Two Hundred Ninety-three, any Filipino citizen of legal
age who is not the owner of a home lot in the municipality or city in which he
resides and who has in good faith established his residence on a parcel of the
public land of the Republic of the Philippines which is not needed for the
public service, shall be given preference to purchase at a private sale of
which reasonable notice shall be given to him not more than one thousand square
meters at a price to be fixed by the Director of Lands with approval of the Secretary
of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
shall be an essential condition of this sale that the occupant has constructed
his house on the land and actually resided therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ten percent of the purchase price shall be
paid upon the approval of the sale and the balance may be paid in full, or in
ten equal annual installments.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">while</span> Section 3
reads:</p>

<blockquote>“The provisions of the Public Land Act with respect to the sale of
lands for residential purposes which are not inconsistent herewith shall be
applicable.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the title alone of R.A. No. 730, it is quite obvious that
indeed, as seen by the respondent court, it merely provides an exception to
Sections 61 and 67 of C.A. No. 141.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
quote with approval the pertinent portions of the disquisition of the respondent
court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The contention of the petitioners that the sale to the <span class="SpellE">Serfinos</span> is void because under Rep. Act No. 730 public
lands for residential purposes must be sold by private sale and for not more
than 1,000 square meters is not meritorious either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 59 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 has
classified public lands which can be sold for residential, commercial, or
industrial purposes into:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) lands
reclaimed by the government; (b) foreshore; (c) marshy lands; and (d) lands not
included in any of the foregoing classes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Sec 60 of the Act, these public lands may be leased or sold to any
person qualified to purchase public lands for agricultural purposes, provided
that the area shall not exceed 144 hectares, as may be determined by the
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Sec. 61, the lands under (a), (b) and (c) classifications can be
disposed of by lease only, while those under (d) classification may either be
leased or sold, Sec. 67 provides that the lease or sale shall be made by oral
bidding to the highest bidder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Secs</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> 61
and 67 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 were amended by Rep. Act No. 730 in the
following manner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The petitioners contend that after the passage of Rep. Act No. 730,
the sale of public lands for residential purposes has been limited to 1,000
square meters only, and that the sale must be <span class="GramE">effected</span>
by private sale only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A close
examination of the law cited by the petitioners, however, shows that it is only
applicable when the conditions specified therein are present, i.e., that
preference shall be given to the applicant if he is not the owner of a home lot
in the municipality or city in which he resides; if he has established his
residence in good faith on a parcel of public land, which is not needed for the
public services; and if the area applied for does not exceed one thousand
square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Sec. 1 of
Rep. Act No. 730 does not repeal <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 61 and 67 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141 entirely, but merely establishes an exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not repeal Sec. 60, either expressly
or by implication.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, R.A. No. 730 authorizes a sale by <u>private</u> <u>sale</u>,
as an exception to the general rule that it should be by <u>bidding</u>, if the
area applied for does not exceed 1,000 square meters, and that the applicant
has in his favor the conditions specified for in Section 1 thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, if the area applied for is in excess
of 1,000 square meters, as in the instant case, the sale must be done only
through bidding.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is<span style=""> </span>DISMISSED and the decision of the respondent court of <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="4">30 April 1979</st1:date> in Civil Case No.
