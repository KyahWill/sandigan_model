				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this case the singular issue is whether or not a bank
mortgagor may be compelled to surrender the duplicate title of the property
mortgaged for registration pursuant to the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform
Program (CARP) of the government when the mortgage obligation has not been paid
for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts <span style="">are </span>undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Respondents</span> spouses
Alexander de Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabalot</span>
obtained a mortgage loan from the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(DBP for short), whereby Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. 77533 and 76343
were offered as collateral.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, the land
described under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 76343 was leased by said
respondents-spouses to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Penticostes</span> </span>on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other lot covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 77533 was
sold to the other petitioner <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Penticostes</span>, Jr. on <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, R.A. No. 6657, otherwise known as the CARP Law was
passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering Section 6 thereof relative
to the registration of deeds or any transactions involving agricultural lands,
petitioners, in compliance therewith, went to the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> to register their deeds of sale and lease
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds,
however, refused to annotate the two (2) deeds <span style="">in the </span><span style="">original file kept
in his Office without the </span><span style="">owner's
</span>duplicate copies of said titles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With this <span style="">requirement, </span>petitioners
went to the DBP to borrow the titles but the latter contended that the
registered owners-spouses thereof still have an unpaid balance on their
mortgage contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners expressed
their willingness to assume the <span style="">same but
</span>did not actually assume nor pay the unpaid obligation so the DBP stood
firm in its refusal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners filed a complaint in the Regional Trial Court
of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> seeking to compel the surrender of the said
titles for purposes of registration, its registration and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion to dismiss the complaint dated <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1988</st1:date> was filed by the
respondent Register of Deeds for lack of cause of action and for failure to
exhaust administrative remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The De
Guzman spouses filed a motion for issuance of a complete set of a copy of the
complaint with motion for extension of time to file the answer on September 19,
1988, having been served on September 9, 1989 a copy of the complaint attached
to the summons which is supposed to consist of six pages, but it actually
consisted of five pages only with page 4 missing so that said respondents
cannot possibly file their answer until after a complete set of the complaint
is served to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The DBP, which was
served a copy of the summons on <st1:date year="1988" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1988</st1:date>, filed a motion to dismiss on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1988</st1:date> <span style="">on
</span>the ground that the claim is unenforceable under the statute of frauds
and that the complaint states no cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="10"><span style="">October
 4, 1988</span></st1:date><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Penticostes</span> filed a
motion to declare respondents in default for failure to file the responsive
pleadings under the rules.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1988</st1:date>
the De Guzman spouses filed their answer with compulsory counter-claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court directed the petitioners to comment on the preliminary issues
raised by the respondents in their special affirmative defenses within five <span style="">(5) </span>days from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1988</st1:date>
petitioners filed their memorandum with a prayer that the presiding <span class="GramE">judge inhibit</span> himself inasmuch as the counsel of petitioners
filed an administrative case against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by the DBP was filed by
petitioners on <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1988</st1:date>
the trial court denied the motion for inhibition for lack of legal ground and
considering that there are issues of facts rendering the ground for dismissal <span style="">not indubitable, action </span>on <span style="">the motion to dismiss was deferred until
after the evidence warrants the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="11"><span style="">November 16, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, plaintiffs filed a motion to declare
respondents</span>-<span style="">spouses in default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24, 1988, the trial court issued an order denying
plaintiffs' motion <span style="">to </span>declare
respondents-spouses <span style="">in </span>default,
considering the provision of Section 4, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court and
considering further that <span style="">respondents-spouses'
counterclaim is compulsory in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for reconsideration thereof was filed by the </span>petitioners and the <span style="">De Guzman spouses were given five (5) </span>days
to <span style="">file their comment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="12">December
 8, 1988</st1:date>, petitioners also filed <span style="">a </span>motion to declare the DBP in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents-spouses filed their comment
on December 14, 1988 stating that they filed a motion to require the petitioner
to furnish a complete copy of the complaint to be able to file an answer and
that they filed the same before their <span style="">motion
was resolved by the trial court and even as petitioner failed </span>to <span style="">furnish them a complete copy of the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December
 14, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the DBP
filed an answer </span>with <span style="">compulsory
counterclaim and alternative compulsory counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="12"><span style="">December 22, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the DBP also filed an opposition to </span>declare
the <span style="">adverse </span>parties <span style="">in default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1989</st1:date>, the trial court denied petitioners’ motion to declare the
DBP in default inasmuch as the latter filed a motion to dismiss on <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1988</st1:date> before the expiry
date to file the answer <span style="">so that the
motion to dismiss is considered an answer.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It ruled that as the case states a common
allegation against the respondents, the court shall try the case against all
upon the considered answer thus seasonably filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also held that the filing of the <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> answer after the </span><span style="">deferment </span><span style="">of the motion
to dismiss did not prejudice the petitioners as the answer is a reiteration of
the issues <span class="GramE">raised</span> in the motion to dismiss which was
treated as an answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial was
thus set on </span><st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="3"><span style="">March 14, 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On said </span><span style="">date, </span><span style="">a pre-trial conference was held after which the trial court rendered a
pre-trial order as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

stipulated and agreed on the following facts:</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That at the time of the execution of the deed of

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 61.65pt; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->That at the time the plaintiffs demanded from
the Development Bank of the Philippines the surrender of the title, they were
duly informed that the loan of defendants-spouses Alexander de Guzman and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabalot</span> was still
outstanding and only partially paid, to which Atty. <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Penticostes</span> expressed his willingness to assume the
same.</p>

<blockquote>The only factual matters to be resolved pertain to damages, the
admission of its proof being dependent on the resolution of the legal issues
raised in the pleadings of the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Parties, through counsel, are hereby directed to submit their
respective memoranda to resolve the legal issues in their pleadings not later
than <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1989</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Without prejudice to the resolution of the legal issues, set the
hearing on <span style="">May 10, 11</span> and 12,
1989, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the morning
(sic)."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The parties filed their memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1989</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered by the trial court dismissing the complaint for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners assailed the trial court for <span style="">rendering a </span>decision when there was allegedly no answer <span style="">filed by the </span>respondents and that they
should have been <span style="">declared in </span><span style="">default.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This allegation is without cogent basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court has taken pains to relate the
antecedent incidents in <span style="">the court </span>in
order to determine the merit of this representation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span>the
case of respondent Register of Deeds, he filed a timely motion to dismiss
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the respondent DBP filed a timely
motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And before its motion
to dismiss was resolved by the court the DBP filed its answer and compulsory
counterclaim on <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the filing of the motion to dismiss by
the DBP the period to file an answer <span style="">is </span>deemed
interrupted until said motion to dismiss is resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, the De Guzman spouses filed, within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to answer, a motion to require the
petitioners to furnish them a complete set of the complaint and for an
extension of time to file the answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, even before the resolution of their motion, they filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1988</st1:date> their answer with
counter-claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No doubt their motion for
the issuance of the complete set of a copy of the complaint with motion for
extension of time to file answer interrupted the running of the period within
which to file the answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">None of the respondents, therefore, was in default as their
answers were timely filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, assuming that any of the respondents failed to file the
answer on time, under Section 4, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court, "when a
complaint states a common cause of action against several defendants, some of
whom answer, and the others fail to do so, the court shall try the case against
all upon the answers thus filed and render judgment upon the evidence
presented."</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the merit of the case, it appears that at the pre-trial,
the parties agreed and entered into a stipulation of facts on the basis of
which the trial court required the parties to file their memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the stipulation of facts of the
parties at the pre-trial, as indeed the facts appear to be undisputed, the
Court can very well resolve the case without need of a trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the issue as to whether or not the respondents may
be compelled to surrender the title of the properties in the possession of the
DBP for registration by the petitioners pursuant to the CARP Law, the trial
court made the following disquisition:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering<span style=""> </span>the
admission<span style=""> </span>of the parties that the loan of
defendants-spouses de Guzman is still outstanding and only partially paid,
defendants-spouses' obligation therefore to deliver said titles is thus
unavailing as the titles were in the possession of the DBP as security of the
loan obtained by said spouses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The provision of the mortgage contract executed by the
mortgagor-spouses states that they could not convey or in any manner encumber
the mortgage property without the written consent of the mortgagor-bank (p. 11,
Answer).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore legally and
physically impossible for defendants-spouses to surrender something which is
not in their possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to defendant DBP, plaintiffs failed to show any legal
basis upon which this Court will use its coercive power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, defendant DBP stands firm
on its contractual right pursuant to the mortgage contract with the other
defendants-spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs, not
being privies to the aforementioned contract, can not invoke their obligation
under the CARP Law to obtain the copies of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. <span style="">77533 </span>and 76343 for the registration
of their right without disturbing defendant <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span>
secured rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiffs' right cannot <span class="GramE">rise</span> higher than
its source, i.e., defendant de Guzman spouses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in plaintiffs' complaint and other pleadings could be found a
legal basis for the surrender of the aforementioned copies of Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>77533 and
76343 which it holds as collateral for the mortgage loan to defendants-spouses
de Guzman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Even<span style=""> </span>the compulsory
registration of rights under par. 4, Sec. 6, of the CARP Law will not justify
disturbance of <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> prior and superior right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What plaintiffs cannot do by way of voluntary
registration could be obtained by some other means, as what plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Penticostes</span> did when
he served a notice of <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>pendens</u></span>
to the office of defendant Register of Deeds (p. 10, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
CARP </span>Law or any other <span class="GramE">law,</span> does not require
from any party compliance under impossible conditions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There being no legal ground for the plaintiffs to compel <span style="">the </span>defendants-spouses de Guzman and
the DBP to surrender the titles, refusal of the Register of Deeds to annotate
plaintiffs' Deed of Sale and Lease Contract without presentation of the owners'
duplicate copies of said titles is in order (Sec. 53, P.D. 1529)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under Section 6 of R.A.
No. 6657 popularly known as the CARP Law it is provided as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Act, any sale, disposition, lease,

original landowner in violation of this Act shall be null and void:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That those executed prior
to <span style="">this Act </span>shall be valid only
when registered <span style="">with </span>the Register
of Deeds within a period of three (3) months after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>

of Deeds shall inform the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) within thirty
(30) days of any transaction involving <span style="">agricultural
</span>lands in excess of five (5) hectares."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">foregoing provision simply means that any
sale, disposition, lease management contract or transfer of possession of
private lands executed by the original land owners in violation of the act
shall be null and void unless it is registered with the Register of Deeds
within a period of three (3) months after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of said act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The documents of sale and
lease in favor of petitioners may be registered only by the Register of Deeds
upon their compliance with the requirement of the law with respect to the
submission of the duplicate copy of the <span class="GramE">owners</span>
certificate of title.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since in this case the
said duplicate titles are in the possession of the DBP as mortgagor thereof and
since it appears that the mortgage loan covering the properties have not been
fully paid for, the DBP had the right to refuse to release the duplicate titles
to the petitioners for purposes of registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners, therefore, may not compel
the DBP through court action to surrender the owners duplicate title of the property
in question for purposes of registration of the documents of petitioners under
