				<H3>JUDGE FELIPE T. TORRES, MTCC, DUMAGUETE CITY AND ATTY. EUGENE SALON, BRANCH CLERK OF COURT, SAME COURT, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ROWENA B. TAYROS, CLERK III, MTCC, DUMAGUETE CITY, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On September 20, 1993 and September 17, 1993, Judge Felipe Torres
of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Dumaguete City, Branch II, Executive Judge
of the MTCC, Dumaguete City and Atty. Eugene Salon, Branch Clerk of Court of
the same court filed letter-complaints against Rowena B. Tayros, Clerk III,
MTCC, Dumaguete City with the office of the Executive Judge, Regional Trial
Court of Negros Oriental.  The
complainants charged Tayros with habitual absenteeism, tardiness and
inefficiency.  They alleged that
respondent had committed several offenses connected with the performance of her
duties <span style="">amounting </span>to <span style="">intentional neglect and failure </span>to <span style="">discharge her duties as Clerk III,
namely:  failure </span>to <span style="">maintain an updated criminal docket book;
failure </span>to <span style="">conduct actual
physical inventory of criminal cases despite </span>verbal and written requests
and directives; and failure to attach return cards and file in the expediente,
pleadings and papers, filed by the parties on time, thereby causing delay in
the court proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Tayros had been absent from work since August 23,
1993 up to the time the complaints were filed and even when she was present,
she was habitually tardy.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 24, 1993, the administrative matter was referred to
Pacifico S. Bulado, Executive Judge, RTC, Dumaguete City for appropriate
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1994, investigating Judge Bulado reported that
complainant Atty. Eugene Salon presented documentary evidence to prove the
truthfulness of her allegations.  Respondent Tayros, on the other hand, disregarded the notice and
directive given by the court to defend herself and to submit her
comments/counter affidavit.  The
investigating judge found respondent guilty of grave misconduct, gross inefficiency
and neglect of duty prejudicial to the best interest of the service and
recommended that she be suspended for one (1) year without pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 22, 1994, the matter was referred to the Office of
Administrative Services for report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 12, 1994, Atty. Adelaida Cabe-Baumann, Deputy Clerk of
Court and Chief, Administrative Services, reported that the records of the
Leave Division of this Court, show that respondent Tayros had been absent from
office without official leave (AWOL) since August 1993; that her salaries were
ordered withheld on November 12, 1993 for being AWOL since August 1993; that a
warning letter was sent to her through Judge Felipe Torres on January 26, 1994,
which she received on February 15, of the same year; that to date, she has not
reported back to work.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the aforesaid acts committed by respondent Tayros are
prejudicial to the best interest of the service.  The uncontroverted evidence presented establishes respondent's
grave misconduct including being absent without leave, warranting the penalty
of dismissal from the service with forfeiture of benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>it is hereby ordered that Rowena B.
Tayros, Clerk III, MTCC, Branch II, Dumaguete City, be DISMISSED from the
service for grave misconduct, absence without leave and conduct prejudicial to
the best interest of public service, with forfeiture of all benefits and with
prejudice to re-employment in any branch or service of the Government,
including government-owned or controlled corporations.  This decision is immediately executory.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">SO ORDERED<span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
