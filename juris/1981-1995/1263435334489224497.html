<blockquote>a.  No wage increase shall
be credited as compliance with the increase prescribed under the Act <i>unless
expressly provided under collective bargaining agreements and such wage
increase shall be granted not earlier than April 1, 1989 but not later than
July 1, 1989.</i>  Where the wage
increase granted is less than the prescribed increase under the Act, the
employer shall pay the difference." (Italics supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent applied the aforequoted rule in crediting the
P300.00 monthly wage increase per employee provided in their CBA to the wage
increase provided for by Rep. Act No. 6727.  The separation pay of the retrenched employees was computed on the basis
of their basic pay, which included the P300.00 CBA wage increase, but did not
include the wage increase granted under Rep. Act No. 6727.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner protested the crediting of the CBA increases to the
legislated increases.   It filed a
complaint for violation of Rep. Act No. 6727 and underpayment of separation
pay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner claims that under section 4 (d) of Rep. Act No. 6727 and Section 8
(a) of the Rules and Regulations implementing said law, crediting of CBA wage
increases to the compliance of Rep. Act No. 6727 is allowed where the following
conditions are met, namely: a) the CBA expressly provides for crediting; and b)
the wage increases must have been granted within three (3) months prior to the
effectivity of the Act or within the period from April 1, 1989 to July 1, 1989.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner agrees that the CBA provides, in Article VIII thereof,
the crediting of CBA increases to future legislated wages.  However, petitioner maintains that the wage
increase of P300.00 monthly for the first year of the CBA, though signed only
on June 22, 1989, is retroactive to January 1, 1989.  Having been made effective on January 1, 1989, the CBA wage
increase is thus, outside of the time frame provided for in Rep. Act No. 6727
and its Implementing Rules of three (3) months prior to the effectivity of said
Act or the period from April 1, 1989 to July 1, 1989.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, petitioner claims that the CBA wage increase of P300.00 for the year
1989 cannot be validly credited as in compliance with the increase prescribed
under Rep. Act No. 6727.  The crediting
made by private respondent was therefore illegal, and resulted in an erroneous
computation of the separation pay for the retrenched employees.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent contends that the CBA
expressly provided for the crediting of the CBA wage increases to the wage
increases mandated by the government and that this was the real intention of
the parties.  That the CBA wage
increases, having been granted on June 19, 1989, when the same was approved by
private respondent's Board of Directors, although made retroactive to January
1, 1989, still falls within the period of crediting under Republic Act No.
6727.  Therefore, its act of crediting
the CBA increase to the legislated increase is legal and the computation of
separation pay valid and correct.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 12, 1990, Labor Arbiter Arthur L. Amansec rendered a
Decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered

<blockquote>1.  Pay the present
employees the additional P300.00 monthly each retroactive as of July 1, 1989
with two percent (2%) monthly interest until compliance is made;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  To pay the differentials
of separation pay to all retrenched employees in the amount of P652.00
multiplied by their length of service; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  To pay the amount
equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the total monetary award as attorney's fees
in favor of complainant's counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Corporation (Sic) Auditing Examiner of this Office <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>hereby directed to compute
immediately the total award of this case, and to submit the same to the
undersigned for appropriate action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the NLRC by private respondent the decision of the
Labor Arbiter was reversed and set aside for lack of cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

In reversing the labor arbiter's ruling, the NLRC held, and We quote:</p>

<blockquote>"We find respondent's appeal meritorious.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The proximity of the signing of the herein parties' CBA
providing for the respondent’s employees' wage increases on 22 June 1989 and
the date of the passage of Rep. Act No. 6727 on June 19, 1989, albeit the same
was made effective only on 1 July 1989, after fifteen days from its
publication, stresses the fact that the impending passage of the latter was
foremost in the minds of the herein parties when they inked the following
stipulation:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Legislated wages shall be credited to said wage increases'
(Agreement dated 17 May 1989)</p>

<blockquote>and again the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The increases above stipulated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">shall be c</span>redited to and shall form part of any salary increase
that may be mandated during each year <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in
</span>which case such increase shall take effect.’ (CBA dated 22 June 1989)</p>

<blockquote>"From the aforequoted covenants, the intendment of the herein
parties appertaining the crediting of their wage increases under the CBA to
government issuances had been clear and admit of no other interpretation other
than what said stipulations purport to be.  As aptly stated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">by </span>the
Supreme Court in the case of Filipinas Golf and Country Club Inc. vs. NLRC,
PTGWO and Local Chapter 424, G.R. No. 62918, August 23, 1989.  The intention of the parties whether or not
to equate benefits under a Collective Bargaining Agreement with those granted
by law must prevail and be given effect.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, complainant capitalizing on the period of coverage
for the crediting of said CBA wage increases to Rep. Act No. 6727 argues that
said CBA wage increases were given on 1 January 1989 beyond the period of
coverage, in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We disagree.  Records
clearly show that it was only sometime on 17 May 1989, when conciliation was
conducted on this very issue of wage increase, resulting in a deadlock in CBA
negotiations that an agreement was reached to give complainant's members this
added benefit then still made subject to the approval of respondent's Board of
Directors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It can be gainsaid therefore, that prior to the approval of
said wage increase by respondent's Board of Directors on 19 June 1989, there
was no wage increase to speak of Ergo, as of 18 June 1989, prior to the approval
in point, there was nothing that can be credited to any wage increase mandated
by law, not even Rep. Act No. 6727.  Complainant's assertion to the effect that a wage increase was already
granted on 1 January 1989 is absolutely misleading and untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In point of fact, the provision contained in the CBA
particularly the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The employees<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>backwages of
P300.00 per month per employee from January 1, 1989 to May 31, 1989, or a total
of P1,500.00 per employee <u>shall  be
paid not later than July 5, 1989.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>equivocably show that the benefit was given
not later than July 5, 1989, as granted on approval of the same by respondent's
Board of Directors on 19 June 1989.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The retroactivity of said grant on 1 January 1989 is of no
moment and does not to our mind alter the intendment of the parties when they
entered into the agreement on 'crediting' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in
</span>question.  Besides, suffice it
for us to point out, that regardless of the provision of Rep. Act No. 6727, the
CBA of the parties have effectively become the law between themselves.</blockquote>

on June 22, 1989, the wage increase was not granted on the same day.  The wage increase was granted on January 1,
1989, the date to which the increase was made effective or made
retroactive.  Having been 'granted' on
January 1, 1989 and not June 22, 1989, the wage increase fell outside of the
period allowed by law for valid crediting citing in support thereof the case of
<i>Filipinas Golf and Country Club </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">v.

wherein it was held "that in making the wage increases retroactive, the
parties to all intents and purposes dated the existence of the CBA back to the
effective date of the increase."</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">While said case involved a similar question of creditability of
wage increases, the above quoted statement was made not as a dogmatic rule, but
only to support the conclusion of the case in favor of creditability of
legislative wage increases to CBA wage increases because such was expressed in
their CBA.  The court in said case also
held:</p>

<blockquote>"A survey of relevant decision of this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">Court </span>fails to support the proposition implicit in the Labor
Arbiter's decision that benefits granted by law may be claimed separately from
and in addition to those granted by collective bargaining agreements under any
and all circumstances.  What seems, on
the contrary, to be the common thrust of applicable rulings is that <i>the
intention of the parties whether or not to equate benefits under a collective
bargaining agreement with those granted by law must prevail and be given
effect.</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<blockquote>"x x x The manifest will and intent of the parties to treat

<p class="BODY">The fact that the CBA wage increase was made effective <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span>January 1, 1989 does not necessarily
mean that the wage increase was granted on that date and not on the date <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>its signing.  We have seen that the statement from <i>Filipinas
Golf </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">v. </span>NLRC</i> which
petitioner used, has failed to sustain its stand because it has no
applicability to the case at bar.  Before the CBA was signed, there was no wage increase to speak of.  Hence it is only logical that the grant of
the wage increase by the CBA, is considered to have been made at the time the
CBA was signed on June 22, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with public respondent's findings regarding the
intention of the parties as regards crediting and the retroactivity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the wage increase benefits.  The proximity of the signing of the CBA on
June 22, 1989 to the passage of Rep. Act No. 6727, on June 19, 1989 coupled
with the CBA stipulation favoring creditability, bolster the conclusion that
the parties did not intend the duplication of wage increase benefits, but
rather crediting the CBA wage increase as part of the legislated increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent NLRC also held that "(t)he retroactivity
of said grant on January 1989 is of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">no </span>moment
and does not to Our mind alter the intendment of the parties when they entered
into the agreement on 'crediting' in question.  Besides, regardless of the provision of Rep. Act No. 6727, the CBA of
the parties have effectively become the law between themselves."</p>

<p class="BODY">The CBA wage increase having been granted on June 22, 1989, or
within the period for 'crediting' as expressly provided in said CBA, We find
that private respondent correctly credited the CBA wage increase to comply with
the mandate of Rep. Act No. 6727 for a P25.00 daily wage increase.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now proceed to the issue of underpayment of separation
pay.  Petitioner claims that the
sixty-one retrenched employees were all entitled to the P25.00 daily wage increase
because the effectivity of the retrenchment was after the effectivity of Rep.
Act No. 6727 on July 1, 1989.  Hence,
the same must be made part of the computation of their separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent on the other hand, contends that the wage increment
under Republic Act No. 6727 was not included in the computation of separation
pay because the effective date <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
retrenchment was June 30, 1989 and before the effectivity of Rep. Act 6727, and
because the retrenched employees already executed affidavits of quit claim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the retrenchment could be validly
done.  Petitioner raises the issue of
the amount of separation pay that the retrenched employees are supposed to
receive.  To resolve this matter, it is
necessary to determine the effectivity date of the retrenchment undertaken by
private respondent.  If it took place
before July 1, 1989, then the wage increase mandated by Rep. Act No. 6727
should not be included in the computation of separation pay.  If it took place on or after July 1, 1989,
then the increase should form part of said separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent NLRC ruled that there was valid crediting of
the CBA wage increase of P300.00 to the legislated wage increase of P25.00
daily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">or </span>P652.00 monthly, and
concluded that:</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 283 of the Labor Code, on retrenchment reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the labor arbiter, retrenchment is valid only when
the following requisites have been met: a) it is to prevent losses; b) written
notices were served on the workers and DOLE at least one month before the
effective date of the retrenchment; and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">c)

He continues:</p>

<blockquote>"Applying this yardstick to the case at bar, there is no
dispute that the cause of the retrenchment is to prevent losses.  While the claims of the parties on the
matter of the actual date of service of notice to the workers are
conflicting.  The uncontroverted fact is
that the written notice of retrenchment was filed with DOLE only on June 22,
1989.  Undisputed likewise is the fact
that the payment of separation pay was partially made on July 5, 1989, and
completed in the first week of August 1989.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing, it is the considered view of this
Office that <u>the retrenchment could not have validly taken effect on June 30,
1989</u>.  At the very least, its
effectivity could be July 22, 1989, one month after respondent filed its
retrenchment notice with DOLE.  To
consider June 30, 1989 as its effective date would be circumventing the law.  This we cannot sustain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Correspondingly, the basis, of computation of separation pay is the
basic pay of the retrenched workers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">as </span>of
July 21, 1989.  As such, it must include
the wage incrememts of P25.00 daily or P652.00 monthly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>The acceptance by the retrenched workers of the separation pay as
computed by respondent, and the subsequent execution and signing of quit claims
do not extinguish respondent's obligation, and the retrenched workers'
entitlement to the back differentials in separation pay.  It is clear from the letter of complainant
that the acceptance of the separation pay is under protest, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">We are therefore placing under protest the separation pay
computation with the advice that the retrenched workers are ready and willing
to accept whatever are your computations subject to this protest.  (Annex "5", Complainant's Position

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact by the labor arbiter should be respected and
left undisturbed there being substantial evidence to support them.  Furthermore, private respondents allegations
that the workers were notified one month before June 30, 1989<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

retrenchment by its presence during the conciliation proceedings, as per

cannot be sustained.  The law requires
that a written notice of retrenchment be filed with the DOLE one month before
the intended date of retrenchment.  The
requirement of the law is very clear.  It cannot be substituted by the Conciliation Minutes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>claimed by private respondent.  While the Conciliation Minutes form part of
the files of the conciliator, its submission cannot constitute substantial
compliance with the requirement of a written notice of retrenchment.  Moreover, the said "Minutes" do
not contain the details necessary to effect the retrenchment program, such as
the names of the employees to be retrenched.</p>

<p class="BODY">The effective date of the retrenchment, as found by the labor
arbiter, could not have been June 30, 1989.  At the very least, it could have been July 22, 1989 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>one month after the retrenchment
notice was filed with the DOLE.  Hence,
the basis for the computation of separation pay should be the basic pay of the
retrenched workers as of July 22, 1989.  It must therefore include the wage increments of P25.00 daily or P652.00
monthly as mandated by Rep. Act No. 6727, subject to crediting of the CBA wage
increase of P300.00 monthly.</p>
