				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> of the
Decision of the former Court of Appeals in its CA-G.R. No. 06922-SP, affirming
the judgment of the then Court of First Instance of Agusan del Sur in Civil
Case No. 135, instituted by private respondents Julito Geolina (GEOLINA, for
short) and Columba Pol (COLUMBA, for short) against Anita Abad Karaos (ABAD
DAUGHTER, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>short), Benigno
Karaos (KARAOS, for short) and petitioners herein (the LANDS OFFICIALS, for
short, inclusive of their subordinate).</p>

<p class="BODY">The original pleading filed with the Trial Court on October 14,
1975, was a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> alleging legal error and abuse of
discretion on the part of the LANDS OFFICIALS in their final resolution of a
conflict between GEOLINA and COLUMBA on one part, and ABAD DAUGHTER and KARAOS
on the other part.  Their controversy
was in regards to the adjudication for private or public sale of a public land
lot of 211 sq. m. in San Francisco, Agusan del Sur (the ABAD-POL LOT, for
short), which was the subject of conflict between COU<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">MBIA </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ABAD </span>DAUGHTER,
and another <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public</span> land lot of
216 sq. m. located in the same municipality, (the KARAOS-GEOLINA LOT, for
short) which was the subject of conflict between GEOLINA and KARAOS.  The ABAD DAUGHTER has assumed the role of
sole successor-in-interest of her deceased father, Manuel Abad, Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Trial Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">no </span>testimonial
evidence was adduced.  The parties, in
the main, merely submitted documentary evidence, on which they were placing
reliance and which were admitted by the Court.  Ordinarily, documentary evidence cannot be invoked against a party who
did not sign the same, or is otherwise estopped to deny its contents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Of course, there are documents, not proven wrong, which by themselves alone can
establish facts.  A certificate of
death, not proven wrong, can establish the fact and date of a person’s death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case </span>at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bar, the exhibits </span>cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be indisputable bases for </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">establishment of controversial facts.  For </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

re-investigation, it was found that both protestants Julito Geolina and Columba
Pol are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">actual </span>possession and Occupation of the
lots in question.  The said possession

<blockquote>x x x x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent’s claim to the building and/or structure occupied by
protestants Geolina and Columba <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Pol </span>appears
to be untenable.  It not in consonance
with human nature that such a situation could be tolerated by anyone.  If it is true that protestants were merely
allowed to stay in the building allegedly constructed by the respondents on the
land in question, respondents could have easily recovered possession of the
same by the simple expedient of filing an ejectment case in court.  But this, they (respondents) never did, thus
making it quite obvious that the structure existing in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">premises </span>of the lots in question is
really owned by the protestants ......<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>A<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>, the LANDS OFFICIALS found that
the ABAD-POL LOT</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">" </span>...... has
been actually occupied by Columba Pol since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">1960 up </span>to the present; that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

respondent Manuel Abad, Sr. whose whereabouts is unknown has not occupied or
introduced any improvement thereon;<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in the Order Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span>J<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>, the
LANDS OFFICIALS said:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"x x </span>x It
appears, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>it has been sufficiently
proved by respond­ents, that as early as 1960 a house was constructed by them
on the land in question.  This fact is
amply established by exhibits 'D, D-1, D-2 and E' of respondent Abad and
exhibits 'B, C, C-1 and C-2' of respondent Karaos.  Being related by affinity, (Abad is the father-in-law of Benigno
Karaos) their house was constructed in such a way that it occupies both the
lots applied for by Manuel Abad, Sr., (Lot 3678) and that of Benigno Karaos
(Lot 3679).  In 1960, respondent Karaos
was assigned to Manila and respondent Manuel Abad, Sr., left for Cebu for
medical treatment.  They entrusted the
land in question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>Romana Pol,
sister of protestant Columba Pol for her to oversee and at the same time,
authorized Manuel Abad, Jr., to act as their administrator.  Unfor­tunately, however, the said Romana Pol
allowed her sister Columba Pol and Julito Geolina to enter and stay in the
premises of the land in question.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What may be deduced from the foregoing are the following
assumptions:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-23.4pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
is admitted that Manuel Abad, Sr. never return­ed from his trip to Cebu for
medical treatment, he probably died in Cebu in 1960.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-23.4pt">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>KARAOS (married to ABAD DAUGHTER) left San
Francisco for Manila in 1960, and he was served with summons in this case in
Metro Manila on November 12, 1975.  The
indication is that, from 1960 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>1975,
he had been residing in Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-23.4pt">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is an indication that, besides the ABAD
DAUGHTER, Manuel Abad, Sr. had another offspring named Manuel Abad, Jr.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-23.4pt">(d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim that Manuel Abad, Jr. was left
administrator of the two lots here in question, while Romana Pol was entrusted <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>to oversee<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span> the property, can be related to
the fact that COLUMBA was already in possession of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ABAD-POL </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">LOT </span>which, being <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>commercial<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>, presupposed that she had a
store or other commercial venture therein.  It can also be related to the finding of the LANDS OFFICIALS in Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>I<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span> that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>x <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x </span>x When respondents left Agusan, they
allegedly entrusted the care of the land in question to Manuel Abad, Jr.  If this is true, how would it have been
possible for protestants to have been able to gain access to and stay in the
premises of the land in question without Manuel Abad, Jr. doing anything about
it.  It is claimed that Manuel Abad, Jr.
informed respond­ent<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Karaos of
the construction being made by Romana Pol, a relative of Columba Pol on the
land in question, yet, they appear not to have done anything about it.  Apparently, respondents do not wish to make
known the fact that they have allowed some other persons to benefit from and
use the land in question which is violative of paragraph 4 of their
applications<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides the documentary evidence, the parties stipulated on facts
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:

<p class="BODY">The cited paragraphs in Part III of the original petition were merely
a recital of the administrative proceedings before the LANDS OFFICIALS.  The mention of the year 1960 is material to
the claim of COLUMBA and GEOLINA that they had better rights than ABAD DAUGHTER
and KARAOS to pur­chase the lots.  The
reference to the <u>residence</u> in the two lots of COLUMBA and GEOLINA,
together with the statement that said lots are <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span><u>commercial</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>,
are relevant to the construction of RA 730.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In effect, there are two questions to be resolved in this
case.  The first issue is the determination
of which of the tandem COLUMBA/GEOLINA and the tandem ABAD DAUGHTER/KARAOS is
entitled to purchase the two lots here involved.  The second issue is to determine whether a lot used for both
residential and commercial purposes is within the ambit of RA 730.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the first issue may be briefly related as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.45in">1. (a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In January 1959, Manuel Abad, Sr. filed a
miscellaneous sales application for the ABAD-POL LOT.  Two months later, his son-in-law KARAOS also filed a
miscellaneous sales application for the KARAOS-GEOLINA LOT.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The two lots are fronting the San Francisco
public market and can be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>commercial<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span> properties.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span>I<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>,
Manuel Abad, Sr. and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">KARAOS </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>each
have a patented agricultural land and a residential land<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span> within San Francisco, while COLUMBA and GEOLINA <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>are still landless<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.45in">3. (a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In 1959/1960 Manuel Abad, Sr. left for Cebu
for medical treatment, while KARAOS also left for Metro Manila where he has
remained a resident.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In 1960, COLUMBA was in possession of the ABAD­-POL
LOT and had constructed a house thereon, while GEOLINA was in possession of the
KARAOS-GEOLINA LOT and had built a house thereon.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The houses of COLUMBA and GEOLINA are their
residences.  It can also be presumed
that they were conducting stores or other <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span>commercial<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>
ventures in the houses.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.45in">5. (a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In June 1969, COLUMBA and GEOLINA filed
separate protests against the sales application of Manuel Abad, Sr. and KARAOS.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>In
September 1969, COLUMBA and GEOLINA filed their own separate miscellaneous
sales application for the two lots.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.45in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">6. (a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>On
</span>February 19, 1970, the LANDS OFFICIALS issued two Orders which rejected
the 1959 applications of Manuel Abad, Sr. and KARAOS, and gave due course to
the applications of COLUMBA and GEOLINA.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Later on, the LANDS OFFICIALS sold the
ABAD-POL LOT to COLUMBA on <u>private</u> <u>sale</u> <u>pursuant</u> <u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>provisions</u> <u>of</u> <u>RA</u> <u>730.</u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1972, ABAD DAUGHTER and KARAOS filed two
separate protests against the sales application of COLUMBA and GEOLINA.  In Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span>I<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>, the
LANDS OFFICIALS rejected the protests of ABAD DAUGHTER and KARAOS and upheld
the proceedings in regards to the applications of COLUMBA and GEOLINA.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">8.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the LANDS OFFICIALS reversed
themselves and rejected the sales applications of COLUMBA and GEOLINA, and gave
due course to the sales applications of Abad, Sr. and KARAOS, and ordered the <u>public</u>
<u>sales</u> of the lots <u>pursuant</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>provisions</u>
<u>of</u> <u>RA</u> <u>730.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">9.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>COLUMBA and GEOLINA then initiated the
instant case before the then Court of First Instance of Agusan del Sur.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court held that COLUMBA and GEOLINA had better rights
than ABAD DAUGHTER and KARAOS to purchase the two lots, and that under RA 730,
those lots, used as residences, can be sold at private sale.  The LANDS OFFICIALS were ordered to issue a
sales patent to COLUMBA, and to proceed with the <u>private</u> <u>sale</u> of
the KARAOS-GEOLINA LOT, on the sales application of GEOLINA.  On appeal to the Appellate Court, the
judgment of the Trial Court was affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the decision of the Appellate Court, the ABAD DAUGHTER and
KARAOS have not come to this instance.  Only the LANDS OFFICIALS have filed the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>
of the Appellate Court's decision.  In
their Petition and in their Brief, the LANDS OFFICIALS have concentrated on the
second issue; that is, they have sustained the proposition that, under RA 730,
only residential lands can be sold through <u>private</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sale</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">.  </span>Although they have
prayed for reversal of the Decision of the Appellate Tribunal, they have not
attempted to show that the Appellate Tribunal had erred in extending
preferential rights to purchase to COLUMBA and GEOLINA.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the conclusions of both Trial and Appellate Courts
that COLUMBA and GEOLINA should be preferred as purchasers of the two lots in
question.  Section 65, as amended, of CA
141 provides that a sales applicant <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>shall
make improve­ments of a permanent character appropriate for the purpose for
which the land is purchased, shall commence work thereon within six months from
the receipt of the Order of award, and shall complete the construction of said
improvements within eighteen months from the date of such award.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> "</span> Because Manuel Abad, Sr. and
KARAOS, after filing their sales applications in 1959, left San Francisco, it
cannot be said that they had made and completed improvements of a permanent
character <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>within eighteen
months from the date of such award<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>,
because, in 1960, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">lots were </span>already occupied by COLUMBA and GEOLINA who had already
built, or had begun building, their own houses thereon.  On the other hand, COLUMBA and GEOLINA,
whose sales application had been filed in 1969 and approved in 1970, could be
deemed to have complied with the statutory requirements before ABAD DAUGHTER
and KARAOS filed their protests in 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be easy to conclude that inaction on the part of Manuel
Abad, Sr. and KARAOS, from 1960 to 1972, to pursue their sales applications can
be viewed as actual abandonment of their rights under those 1959
applications.  Section 65 tacitly
requires that sales applicants should remain in posses­sion, actual or
constructive, from the time applications are submitted to the date of actual
purchase.  That requirement cannot be
said as having been complied with in respect of Manuel Abad, Sr. and
KARAOS.  Incidentally, it might be
pointed out that, in Exhibit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>I<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>, the LANDS OFFICIALS had
correctly considered in favor of COLUMBA and GEOLINA the fact that both ABAD
DAUGHTER and KARAOS <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>each
have a patented agricultural land and a residential land within Pls-67 while
protestants (COLUMBA/GEOLINA) are still landless<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It might further be stated now that if the LANDS OFFICIALS had
delineated the controversy between COLUMBA/GEOLINA and ABAD DAUGHTER/KARAOS in
their petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, the chances could have been
that due course would have been granted only in respect of the second issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree with the Appellate Court in regards to the second
issue.  Section 58 of the Public Land
Act provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>SEC. 58.  Any tract of land of the public domain
which, being neither timber nor mineral land, is intended to be used for
residential purposes or for commercial, industrial, or other productive
purposes other than agricultural, and is open to disposition or concession,
shall be disposed of under the provisions of this chapter and not otherwise.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that classification under the section is not
based on the <u>nature</u> of the land, which would be impractical, but is
based <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>purposes<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span> of use.  The problem which can arise is in respect,
as in this case, of land the purpose of which is both residential and
commercial.</p>

<p class="BODY">We refer to other relevant statutes for a derivation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>meaning.  PD 20 uses the term <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>dwelling
unit<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>.  It had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">generally conceded that the term is not limited to a unit exclusively
used as a residence, but also covers houses used as residences and also for
small stores and small </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">commercial</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In BP No. 25, it has been
expressly provided that a residential unit includes </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

purposes if the owner thereof and his family actually live therein and use it <u>principally</u>
for dwelling purposes</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.  Since COLUMBA and GEOLINA have no residences in San Francisco, the lots
they have applied for should be considered as being used principally for
dwelling purposes</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">although they
may have a store or other commercial venture therein which would amount to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

public land</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.  Those terms apply to the situation of COLUMBA and GEOLINA.  Even if their intention is to acquire the
lots both for residence and commercial venture, the <u>principal</u> purpose
should be residential.  Residence is a
requirement of a person with priority to the requirement for a place of
business.  Hence, we consider that the
lots here involved are for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">residential purposes</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

statute.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The LANDS OFFICIALS,
prior to their change of mind, had previously held in the specific case of
COLUMBA that public lots used both for residential and commercial purposes are
covered by RA 730 (Exhibits </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">G</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

13.0pt">H</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">).  The Trial Court, confirmed by the Appellate Court, had made reference to
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">pre</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vious instances where the LANDS OFFICIALS had
disposed of lots, similar to those applied for by COLUMBA and GEOLINA, under RA
730.  Said the Trial Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>The
petitioners have demonstrated with their Exhibits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">P, </span>P-1, P-1-A, P-1-B, and P-2 that the Bureau of Lands has
disposed of two commer­cial lots (Lots Nos. 3682 and 3687 'within the vicinity
of the Public Market of San Francisco, Agusan del Sur, just across the street
from, the Public Market on the Western side, along the same line where Lots
Nos. 3678 and 3679 (in question) are located'), one to a Tito Contreras, and
the other to a Rodolfo Cornejo, without benefit of public bidding and in
accordance with Republic Act 730.  What
the actual number of com­mercial lots in the San Francisco public market area
have been similar­ly disposed of and already titled is not shown.  But the Court can safely assume that there
are more for if two can do it, why not the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">other </span>applicant-occupants, as peti­tioners are now
situated?  Petitioners have likewise
shown with their Exhi­bits Q, Q-1, Q-1-A, Q-2 and Q-2-A that the said Bureau of
Lands has similarly disposed of one commercial lot (Lot 803-A, Cad-11070-D,
equivalent to Lot No. 820, Cad-84) situated in Poblacion, Butuan City to one
Ernesto Reyes, in accordance with Republic Act 730 and without public bidding.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span>The foregoing
are mere samples of instances where the Bureau of Lands has sold to qualified
applicant occupants lots classified as commercial in its survey without public
bidding and pursuant to the provisions of Republic Act 730.  It would not, therefore, be farfetched to
presume that a good number of occupants of public lands suitable for commerce
and classified as commercial, has succeeded in securing title to said lots
under and pursuant to Republic Act 730 since June 18, 1952, when said law was
enacted.  What then will happen if the
Court were to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">give </span>nod to and
uphold the respondents' suggestion that said titles be done away with and
nullified for having allegedly been issued and secured in violation of
law.  x x</blockquote>

appli­cation of laws, it is presumed that the law making body in­tended right

<blockquote>It is the sense of the Court that by making
Republic Act 730 applicable to commercial and industrial lots used at the same
time as home lots as well as to lots classified as resi­dential would be more
in keeping with right and justice.<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Together with the Appellate Court, we subscribe to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">foregoing </span>dissertation.  If the LANDS OFFICIALS were a doctrinal Court,
