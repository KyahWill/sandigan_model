ALFREDO B. CONCEPCION AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT
OF FIRST INSTANCE OF CAVITE, BRANCH IV-TAGAYTAY CITY AND MIGUEL
ILAGAN, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>TEEHANKEE, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court hereby sets aside the questioned orders of respondent
judge disapproving herein petitioner's appeal bond in Civil Case No. TG-438 of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Tagaytay</span> City, upon the ground that said bond "is <span style="">void </span>and unenforceable for lack of a
principal debtor or obligation," and peremptorily declaring his judg­ment
under appeal as having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and
ordering execution thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mere
technical defect or im­perfection in the filing of an appeal bond does not
render the decision subject of the appeal immediately final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, for where said bond is in substantial conformity
with the provisions of the law such that its legal effect accomplishes the
objective of insuring to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the payment of
the costs of appeal, the appeal should be given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an action for the enforcement of a commercial vehicle
comprehensive insurance policy with damages, judgment was rendered by
respondent judge sentencing petitioner as defendant to pay respondent-plaintiff
<span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span> "the total sum of P18,773.58 minus the
sum of P500.00 representing the deductible franchise, plus attorney's fees in
the amount of P5,600.00 or the total sum of P23,873.58, with interest thereon
at the rate of 36% per annum from February 21, 1978 until said amount shall
have been fully satisfied; and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">From said judgment, petitioner-defendant timely filed a notice of
appeal, appeal bond and a record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the herein private respondent, the prevailing party in the lower
court, filed therein a motion to dismiss the appeal and for the issuance of a
writ of execution, impugning the validity of petitioner's appeal bond as having
no principal debtor and therefore void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Despite opposition, respondent judge upheld <span style="">respondent's contention and </span>denied due
course to the appeal and further directed the issuance of the corresponding
writ of execution <span style="">a </span>judgment, in
his questioned Order of January 28, 1981, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"No issue exists regarding the seasonable filing of the
notice, bond and record of appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
issue centers on the efficacy of the appeal bond executed by Rodrigo Y. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, both lawyers, as 'sureties', whereby they 'jointly
and severally bind (themselves) in favor of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for the payment of
cost <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>x.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As correctly pointed out by the plaintiff, the disputed
appeal bond is void and unenforceable for lack of a principal debtor or obliga­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, while the sureties bound them­selves
to pay, jointly and severally, 'such an undertaking presupposes that the
obligation is enforceable against someone else besides the (sureties), and the
latter could always claim <span style="">that </span>it
was never (their) intention to be the sole person obligated thereby.' (Manila
Rail­road <span style="">Co., </span>et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span>, 17 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 154, 156.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It, therefore, follows that the judgment rendered in this
case had become final and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">executory</span></span><span style="">, </span>because
the defendant had not filed <span style="">any appeal
bond in </span>due time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Reconsideration was </span>denied
in respondent judge's Order of <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="3">March
 27, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petition for <i>certiorari</i> which we find to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Rule 41 of the Rules of Court reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Appeal
Bond</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appeal bond shall answer
for the payment of costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>shall be in the amount of one
hundred and twenty pesos (P120) unless the court shall fix a different
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the appeal bond is not in
cash, it must be approved by the court before the trans­mittal of the record on
appeal to the appel­late court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The last sentence of the above quoted section presupposes that
before elevating the record on appeal to the appellate court, the trial court <span style="">has </span>the duty to pass upon the suffi­ciency
of the appeal bond, and it is called upon to require the party-appellant within
<span style="">a </span>period of time to fully comply
with the requirements as to said appeal bond in case of some defect in its
execution, in the same manner it requires correction or amplification of a
deficient record on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it
behooves the trial court upon opposition to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of an appeal bond to examine it, to declare it lacking of the requirements if
it be so, and then to require and allow the appellant to complete or amend it
in accordance with instructions within <span style="">a
</span>reasonable period, so as to per­fect the appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as in the filing of records on appeal,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court has invariably taken a liberal attitude in favor of the appellant
when it comes to the filing of appeal bonds in relation to perfection of
appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it has been held that an appeal bond <span style="">is </span>sufficient when it is in
substantial conformity with the provisions of the law as long as the legal
effect is to insure to the <span class="SpellE">ap­pellee</span> the payment of
all costs required by <span style="">law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In Javier Cruz vs. Enriquez,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which is similar to the case at bar, the respondent judge therein ordered the
disapproval of the appeal bond after discovering that the <span style="">same </span>consisted merely in the
signatures of two lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
ruled therein <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This provision of law<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
does not pres­cribe a special form for appeal bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only requires that the <span style="">same </span>be for the amount of sixty pesos,
(at that time) ‘conditioned for <span style="">the
payment of costs which the appellate court may award against </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">appellant.’ </span><span style="">The </span><span style="">bond in question </span><u><span style="">complies substantially</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">with
the provision of law, and </span><span style="">we see
</span><span style="">no reason why the respondent
judge found it defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he
approved the record on appeal, there has been an implied approval of the
original bond, and </span>we find no reason either why after such approval, he
had to disapprove said bond and dismiss the appeal on the allegation that the
new bond was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, granting that the first bond was really defective, <u><span style="">justice </span>demands</u> that herein
petitioners, as appellants in that case, be given an <u><span style="">opportunity to cure its defect</span></u><span style=""> <u>by filing, as they did, another bond</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In dismissing the appeal the
respondent judge has entirely overlooked the fact that the second bond was not
a new one but merely <span style="">a </span>correction
<span style="">of </span>the original supposedly
defective bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent <span class="SpellE">Laserna</span> vigorously
contends that under the inherent powers of the court to amend and control its
process and orders so <span style="">as </span>to make
them conformable to law and justice, the dis­missal of the appeal on the ground
that the first bond was defective and the second one was filed out of time,
should be sustained; but under the facts obtaining in the case, this contention
is evidently untenable for the original bond, in our opinion, is not defective,
and even granting that it were, petitioners herein were diligent in curing the
supposed defect by filing <span style="">a </span>new
bond in order to protect their right to appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, the respondent judge should not have been <u><span style="">strictly technical</span></u><span style=""> </span>in the application of the rules, for
in so doing he has <u><span style="">deprived herein
petitioners of their right to appeal</span></u><span style="">, </span>or at least to perfect it within the time allowed by
law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question in the instant case, as acknowledged in the
challenged order, that the record on appeal, notice of appeal and the appeal
bond were filed on time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, as in
the above cited case of <u>Cruz</u>, the appeal bond in question was executed
by petitioner's lawyers, Attys. Rodrigo Y. <span class="SpellE">Arandia</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Porfirio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, both
lawyers of the law firm representing herein petitioner as defendant in the main
case, as well as in the case at bar, whereby they did "hereby jointly and
severally bind ourselves in favor of Miguel <span class="SpellE">Ilagan</span>,
in the amount of One Hundred Twenty Pesos (P120.00) conditioned for the payment
of costs which the appellate court may award against appellants." Clearly
enough, this undertaking, albeit not signed by herein pe­titioner as
party-appellant, effectively insures to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
the payment of costs and <span style="">is, </span>therefore,
in subs­tantial compliance with the requirement of the cited Rule, for they
certainly are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying principal lia­bility
under the said bond, as baselessly feared by res­pondent judge in his Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">One additional observation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The authority cited by respondent judge in the questioned order, <u>Manila
Railroad Company (<span class="SpellE">MRC</span>) vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the appeal bond was held void and unenforceable for lack of a principal
debtor or obligation since the <span class="SpellE">MRC</span> as co-appellant of
the Manila Port Service was not a signatory to the bond, has been superseded by
the decision of this <span style="">same </span>court in
the later case of <u>Manila Railroad Company vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvendia</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where we held that the Manila Port Service must be deemed part of the Manila
Railroad Company and not a separate entity in a suit against the <span class="SpellE">MRC</span> based on <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations
undertaken by it through its "agents and subsidiary," the Manila Port
Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in this case the
lawyers as agents and attorneys of petitioners properly executed the appeal
bond in their own name but for the benefit and on behalf of petitioner as their
client, who has in turn ratified as principal the execution of said appeal bond
with the very prosecution of this action, as evidenced by the verification of
the petition at bar by petitioner's vice-president.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> judgment <span style="">is </span>hereby rendered setting aside respondent judge's orders of
January <span style="">28, 1981 </span>and March <span style="">27, </span>1981 and ordering respondent judge
to give due course to the appeal and <span style="">to
</span>transmit the records to the Court of Appeals for proper proceedings and
determination of the appeal on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
