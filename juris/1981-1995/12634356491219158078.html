Attorney Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, Concordia Gladys <span class="SpellE">Ysmael</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> <span class="SpellE">Rentao</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> filed an
administrative complaint charging respondents Gallardo C. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
deputy sheriff of the Office of the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court
of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila, and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> D. Castro, Jr., Clerk of Court and Ex-<span class="SpellE">Oficio</span> Sheriff of the same court, with grave abuse of
authority, serious misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of
the service, in connection with their actuations in Civil Case No. R-83-19048
(41518) entitled, "Philippine Trust Company vs. Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>,
et al.," of Branch 12, Regional Trial Court of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set out in the resolution of this Court dated <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1988</st1:date> in G.R. No. 81142
entitled, "Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> vs. Justice Lorna <span class="SpellE">Lombos-Dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Fuente</span>, et.
al.," the background facts of this case are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1958, Attorney Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
borrowed P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from PHILTRUST. As security for
the loan, her parents mortgaged to PHILTRUST some properties in <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. For failure of
the debtors to pay the loan when due, the bank commenced foreclosure proceedings
in 1963. Eventually, as highest bidder at the public sale, the bank
consolidated its ownership over the mortgaged properties. A new title was
issued in its name on <st1:date month="3" day="13" year="1972">March 13, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1974, the <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
residence which stood on the foreclosed property was destroyed by a typhoon.
Apparently, Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> had not vacated it, for
she rebuilt it in January 1975. In 1980, the bank sold the property to Alto
Industrial Enterprises, Inc. On <st1:date month="8" day="28" year="1989">August
 28, 1989</st1:date>, a writ of possession was issued by Judge Castaneda of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 17, whom Lumen <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>
sought to disqualify. The case was raffled to Branch 12 presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Procoro</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, who issued a
second alias writ of possession on October 15, 1990. It was given to respondent
deputy sheriff Gallardo <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for implementation.
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, et al. challenged Judge <span class="SpellE">Donato's</span> order in the Court of Appeals but without success.
Her petition was dismissed by the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1991" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1991</st1:date>. Her petition for review of the
Appellate Court's decision was likewise dismissed by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="12" year="1990">November 12, 1990</st1:date>,
Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> filed in court a motion for
approval of his estimate of expenses for the implementation of the writ of
possession and prayed that the plaintiff be ordered to deposit the amount with
the sheriff. The court, however, deferred action on <span class="SpellE">Tolentino's</span>
motion until after the hearing on <st1:date month="12" day="6" year="1990">December
 6, 1990</st1:date> of <span class="SpellE">Policarpio's</span> motion for
reconsideration. Without waiting for the court's action on his motion, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> proceeded to implement the alias writ of
possession on <st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1990">November 14, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="29" year="1990">November 29, 1990</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> found <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
guilty of indirect contempt for his undue haste in implementing the alias writ
of possession without waiting for the court's approval of his estimate of
expenses for the implementation of said writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="4" year="1991">October 4, 1991</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> filed with the Executive Judge of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila, a
sheriff's Return and Manifestation seeking authority to place certain personal
property of the complainants in a bonded warehouse. He also asked the court to
approve his bill of expenses for moving the complainants' property from the
premises. On <st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1991">October 7, 1991</st1:date>,
Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> issued the order prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 14, 1991, acting by virtue of the resolution of the
Supreme Court dated August 28, 1991 in the case of "Simeon <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, et al. vs. CA, G.R. No. 97963, as well as the
October 7, 1991 order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span>, deputy sheriff
Gallardo <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, with the knowledge and approval
of clerk of court Attorney <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> D. Castro, and
aided by <span class="SpellE">PHILTRUST's</span> lawyer and a support force of
thirty (30) bank employees, forcibly opened the house of the complainants,
ransacked the same, removed all the personal property therein, and transferred
them to an undisclosed bonded warehouse in <span class="SpellE">Pandacan</span>;
Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, <st1:date month="10" day="15" year="1991">October
 15, 1991</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> recalled and set
aside his <st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1991">October 7, 1991</st1:date>
order for fear that it might be misinterpreted as an assumption of jurisdiction
over the case by the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants filed this administrative complaint against the
respondents, alleging that the enforcement of the writ of possession by
breaking into the <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> home which was not even
"included in the mortgage with the <span class="SpellE">Philtrust</span>"
(p. 2, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), was unlawful because the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> had no jurisdiction over the
case. Despite that, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> filed his Return and
Manifestation in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.
Complainants filed robbery charges against the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that the implementation of the writ of
possession on <st1:date month="10" day="14" year="1991">October 14, 1991</st1:date>
by the respondents was premature and irregular. It was carried out with undue
haste and in an oppressive manner, without awaiting the court's action on
respondent sheriff's motion for approval of his estimated expenses. As a matter
of fact, for that misconduct, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> was found
guilty of indirect contempt by Judge <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 12.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, as
recommended by the Court Administrator, respondents Gallardo C. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
Castro are found guilty of abuse of authority and serious misconduct and are
each ordered to pay a fine of TWO THOUSAND (P2,000.00) PESOS for having
arbitrarily and oppressively disregarded procedural rules in implementing the
writ of possession on the property of the herein complainants. They are warned
that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with
more severely and they are admonished to henceforth exercise utmost care and
prudence in the performance of their duties.</p>
