<p class="BODY">The summary of the facts and evidences narrated by the trial
court which was quoted by the Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of
Appeals, is as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs' evidence tends to establish that they caused the
construction of the house in question on or about <st1:date year="1962" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1962</st1:date> through his brother-in-law Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> and two helpers, <span class="SpellE">Gavino</span>
Reyes <span style="">and </span>Pedro Antonio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They secured a building permit dated <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1962</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'<span class="GramE">A</span>').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
house was finished in two weeks at the cost of P500.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made additional constructions thereafter
and the house was completely finished in 1968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They lost all the receipts for the materials used in the initial
construction of the house in 1962 but he was able to save some of the receipts
for the materials used in the additional construction (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
<span class="GramE">D, D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4, D-5, Dd-6 &amp; D?8).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in 1963, <span class="SpellE">Querico</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz caused the construction of a shed through
his brother-in-law Perfecto in front of the house and another shed at the back
by the defendant as a transient 'visitor'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the construction of the house in question, plaintiffs
were residing in another house on a lot leased by them from the Manila Railroad
Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This house was razed to the
ground by the fire in the vicinity of the <span style="">MRR
</span>lots and the lot they were leasing was thereafter occupied by the Luzon
Bus Line (Now Philippine National Railway Motor Service).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs looked for another lot so that
they could build a new house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
sold her rights to the plaintiffs over the lot on lease to her by MRR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agreement, however, was only verbal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house in question was declared for
taxation purposes in the name of Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> on
<st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1964</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) <span class="GramE">and</span> they paid taxes
thereon (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">C, C-1 &amp; C-2).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted that they were sued for Unlawful
<span class="SpellE">Detainer</span> by the defendant on May 26, 1964 before the
Municipal Court (now City Court) of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> in
Civil Case No. 3355 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they received the complaint in said
case, they still made improvements and constructed additional parts on the
house in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, defendant's evidence tends to establish
that after her first house erected on the same lot leased to her by the MRR was
burned down by the fire she caused the construction of the house in question
within the month after she secured a building permit on <st1:date year="1962" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1962</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. 'A').</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was
finished in two weeks time by the carpenters Vicente Robles and Salvador
Catalan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately after the
construction, plaintiffs requested that they be allowed to rent a portion of
her house by putting a partition at the rate of P30.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six days after, plaintiffs transferred to her
house with only one (1) sewing machine of Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span>
who is a seamstress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lot on which
the house in question stands is leased to her by the MRR at P100.00 a year (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs
paid rentals in the sum of P30.00 for the first month and thereafter, payments
were irregularly made at P1.00 to P2.00 for a total of five months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her husband died, the rental payments
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs likewise constructed
against her will a shed ('<span class="SpellE">sibi</span>') in front of the
house near the street when they expanded their sewing business and added five
(5) more <span style="">sewing
</span>machines to the original one (1) sewing machine when they first
transferred to her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs
spent for this shed and for other additional constructions made against her
will which they occupied in addition to the original portion of her house which
they were renting from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She demanded
payments for the rentals in arrears but <span class="GramE">plaintiffs repeatedly
refused to pay and was</span> even driving her away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She consulted a lawyer who sent demand letter
to plaintiff to vacate the house in question (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
17, 18 and 18-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she filed
Civil Case No. 3355 for Unlawful <span class="SpellE">Detainer</span> in the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
19) and a decision was rendered in her favor (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
21) ordering the plaintiffs to vacate the premises and to pay the rentals in
arrears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs were evicted as per
Sheriff's return of service (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 29) but plaintiffs
returned the next day with their belongings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A Criminal Case was filed against plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Querico</span>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz when he attempted to stab her when
defendant wanted to enter her house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being <span style="">a
</span>childless old widow, with no other companion in the house, she was
forced to reside in another place at <st1:street><st1:address>del <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 165-167)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1979</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered its decision, rejecting petitioners' right over the
house in controversy, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads:</p>

rendered, ordering the plaintiffs as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span> <span class="GramE">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 69-73).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, petitioners moved to present
certain pieces of evidence which were not brought before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
but which the appellate court denied, it appearing that said documents could
have been presented in the lower court, but were not, and therefore not
considered newly-discovered evidence (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 172).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 29, 1984, while pending appeal in the Court of
Appeals, respondent Maria De Jesus died in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>
City as shown by a Death Certificate (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 154) and prior to her
death she ceded her rights to lease the lot owned by the PNR to Jose <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City
for and in consideration of the sum of P1.00 and other valuable considerations
as shown in a deed of Transfer of Rights dated June 13, 1980 <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 151).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for respondent moved for substitution
of parties which was opposed by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered its decision affirming the trial court's judgment
with the modification that Maria De Jesus, the deceased defendant, was ordered
substituted by Jose <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> and Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> who were <span class="GramE">transferees</span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">pendente</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> </span>under
Section 20, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,

for reconsideration of aforesaid decision was denied in the resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1988</st1:date> <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 188).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the required pleadings were filed, the petition was given
due course and the parties were required to file simultaneous memoranda in the
Resolution of <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1989</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 220).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners' memorandum was filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 222)
while private respondents' memorandum was submitted on <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1989</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 252).</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in this case as to who of the contending
parties is the legitimate possessor of the lot and owner of the house in
dispute, is a question of fact resting mainly on the credibility of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic legal precept that factual issues may not be
reviewed by the Supreme Court under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Amurao</span> v. Court of Appeals, <span style="">et </span>al., 168 SCRA 737 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Supreme Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of
facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions and findings of
fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not
be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">fact that the appellate
court adopted the findings of the trial court make</span> the same binding upon
the Supreme Court for the factual findings of the appellate court are generally
binding on the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
findings of the Court of Appeals when supported by substantial evidence are almost
beyond the power of review by the Supreme Court (Sabena Belgian World Airlines
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 82068, March 31, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by both the trial court and the Intermediate Appellate
Court, respondent De Jesus is the lessee of the <span style="">lot </span>situated at <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City owned
by the PNR, as early as 1954 and built a house thereon in March 1962, right
after her first house had been razed to the ground in the same year, and that
petitioners are occupying the house in dispute <span style="">as mere </span>lessees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners' alleged right to occupy the lot
leased to the respondent as having sprang from a verbal contract of sale of
right to lease the lot remained <span class="SpellE">unestablished</span>,
unsubstantiated and self-serving.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, petitioners' claim that there was a verbal contract of
sale of right to lease between them and respondent is inconceivable, it
appearing that: (a) prior demands to pay lease rentals in arrears were given
upon them by respondent's counsel in March 1964; (b) they were sued for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> by respondent in May 1964 before
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City; (c) aforesaid
court rendered its judgment in December <span style="">1966,
ordering petitioners' eviction from the house in controversy for non</span>-<span style="">payment </span>of rentals; (d) subsequent
eviction of petitioners in execution of the said decision; and (e) admissions
by petitioners that they were sued for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
and that they introduced additional constructions on the controversial house
despite protestations of the respondent during and after the proceedings in the
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, respondent's alleged sale of right to lease is in the
nature of an assignment of lease, a prohibited and illegal practice without the
consent of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, unless there is a stipulation
to the contrary enunciated under Article 1649 of the New Civil Code (<span class="SpellE">Dakudao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>, 122 SCRA
881 [1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the right to lease <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> subject lot over which the subject house was built
belonged to respondent as far back as 1954 while petitioners' additional
evidence submitted before the Court of Appeals tends to show that they became
lessees of PNR of the <span style="">lot </span>only
in January 14, 1982 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 141) that is, 28 years
after and rentals <span style="">for the lot were paid
</span>only in 1977 <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., p</span>.
139), which is about 23 years, both reckoned from respondent's lease contract <span style="">with PNR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consideration of petitioners' forgotten evidence, i.e., temporary
building permit (1977), rental payments (1977), lease contract (1982) and tax
declarations, which were not presented before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
would not alter the findings of fact in the case at bar as they merely
corroborate and add up to petitioners' existing evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
which had already attained finality operates as the 'law of the case' as to who
between the parties has the right of possession over the subject house but not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE">j<u>udicata</u></span> with
respect to the issue of ownership since the municipal court's jurisdiction is
confined to issues involving physical possession of the property, under Section
88, Judiciary Act of 1948 (now Section 33(2), Judiciary Reorganization Act of
1980).</p>

<p class="BODY">The less familiar concept or less terminological usage of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> as a
rule on conclusiveness of judgment refers to the situation where the judgment
in the prior action operates as an <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> only as
to the matters actually determined therein or which were necessarily included
therein (<span class="SpellE">Machoca</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Carriaga</span>,
G.R. No. 75109-10, June 28, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the substitution of party on the basis of the
"Transfer of Rights" executed by respondent De Jesus in favor of Jose
<span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> covering the lot was not proper and
erroneously allowed for the following reasons: (1) the transfer <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span> of
the <u>right</u> <u>to</u> <u>lease</u> <u>the</u> <u>lot</u> admittedly owned
by the PNR has no bearing <span style="">on </span>the
main case since the property litigated concerns only the <u>house</u> located
at <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> land; (2) what was transferred by respondent
unto <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> was the right to lease the <span class="SpellE">PNR's</span> lot, which, as heretofore discussed, is <span style="">a </span>prohibited act without the owner's
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to choose one's
lessee is a prerogative of PNR being owner of the leased lot; and (3) the
instrument itself does not speak of transfer/cession/assignment of the house
subject of the suit, but only of rights and interests over the lot.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the petition for review is
hereby DENIED for lack of merit and the assailed decision of the Intermediate
Appellate Court is hereby AFFIRMED but MODIFIED to disallow the improper
substitution of Jose <span class="SpellE">Bagaybagayan</span> as party in this
case in lieu of Maria de Jesus.</p>
