				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by the accused Salvador V. <span class="SpellE">Lutañez</span> alias "Jun <span class="SpellE">Plementero</span>"
from the judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> rendered in Criminal Case No.

parents in the amount of P12,000.00, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record of the case shows that at about 7:00 o'clock in the
evening of 12 March 1980, while <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> and her children named Rosemarie, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span>, Ricardo, and <span class="SpellE">Melogine</span>,

she heard a man downstairs ordering <span style="">in </span>this
manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"all the women come out,

<span style="">W</span>hen nobody made a <span style="">move to go down, the muzzle of a gun was
poked through the wall of the house made of coconut leaf </span><span style="">shingles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon </span><span style="">thereafter, a man whom they later identified as the herein</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">appellant,
Salvador V. <span class="SpellE">Lutañez</span> alias </span><span style="">"Jun </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Plementero</span></span><span style="">", pushed open the makeshift door of the

15-year old daughter of <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>, the appellant
beckoned the girl to him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> When <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> was

<p class="BODY">With a gun tucked in his waist and another slung over his
shoulder, the appellant held the right hand of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and brought her to the deserted hut of Ka Eric <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>,
about one-half kilometer away, where the appellant made her <span style="">lie </span>down and removed her panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> struggled
but she could <span style="">not overcome the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also tried to shout, but
the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">appellant covered her mouth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant then pulled her legs apart and
inserted his organ into her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the first time she had sexual intercourse with a man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant raped her twice that night.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, after the appellant had left with <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> ran to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Espiridion</span> <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
to seek help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isorena</span>
then accompanied <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain, one <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Caballes</span>
who, in turn, reported the incident to the PC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the return of <span class="SpellE">Isorena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>, they met Adriano <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>,
a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">tanod</span>, whom they
invited to accompany them.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After satisfying his lust, the appellant brought <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> back to her mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching the house, the appellant demanded that the mother of the
child come down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
pleaded with the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
At that instant, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span>
and his companions arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>, the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">tanod</span>, directed his flashlight at the appellant who ran
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They chased him, but they were
unable to overtake him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, PC
soldiers and the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They looked around the house and after about
twenty minutes they left, bringing with them <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> and her children, who passed the night in the

<blockquote>"That on or about the 12th day of March, 1980, in the <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> of <span class="SpellE">Balitwak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Isidro, Municipality of San Luis, Province of

<p class="BODY">When arraigned, the accused, assisted by counsel, pleaded not
guilty to the commission of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
At the stand, he denied that he abducted and then raped the complainant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> on the night of <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="3">12 March 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he was in <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> on the said
day.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
His claim was corroborated by Mario <span class="SpellE">Danipog</span> and Jun <span class="SpellE">Collado</span> who both testified that the accused and other
residents of <span class="SpellE">Sinipit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, attended the
birthday party of <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> Corpus held at the <span class="SpellE">Banquerohan</span> River, <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span> City,
where they stayed up to 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, after which they went to
the house of the accused where they had a drinking spree until midnight of the
said day.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the trial court did not give credence to the appellant's
alibi since he was positively identified by prosecution witnesses who had no
motive to testify falsely against him and rendered judgment in the case,
sentencing the accused, under the charge, to suffer the penalty aforesaid.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon, the accused instituted the present appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support thereof, he claims that the trial
court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in giving credence to
the testimonies of prosecution witnesses in readily identifying the accused
whom they all allegedly saw for a fleeting moment on the night of 12 March
1980; (2) in concluding that complaining witness <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
<span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> was abducted and raped by accused-appellant
on the night of 12 March 1980; (3) <span style="">in </span>convicting
the accused-appellant solely on the question of whether his defense of alibi is
available and worthy, and not on the strength of the corroborated and firmly
established alibi of the accused-appellant for failure of the prosecution to
prove <span style="">his </span>guilt beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The issues raised by the appellant involve the credibility of witnesses
and we have repeatedly upheld the well-established rule that conclusions and
findings of fact of the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal
because the trial court is in a better position to observe the demeanor and
credi­bility of the witnesses while testifying.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While there may be some exceptions to this rule,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
we find that the present case is not within such exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the complainant on how she was forcibly taken
from her home and brought to a deserted hut, about half a kilometer away, <span style="">and </span>then raped twice, is credible and
we find nothing unusual or improbable in it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her testimony appears <span style="">to </span>be
straightforward and consistent and she had no motive to testify falsely against
the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court has
consistently held that the testimony of a rape victim as to who abused her is
credible where she had no motive to testify falsely against the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
We need not also belabor the rule that no Filipino girl would publicly admit that
she had been ravished unless this is the truth for her natural instinct is to
protect her honor and future.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We can not give credence to the appellant's claim that he was
somewhere else at the time of the commission of the crime because the appellant
was positively identified as the culprit by prosecution witnesses who had no
ulterior motive to impute to him the commission of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the appellant was identified by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
<span class="SpellE">Porbido</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> by his pock-marked face and recognition was easy
because the house was sufficiently illuminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the appellant contends that the testimonies
of said witnesses should not be given credence because such testimonies
identifying him by his pock-marked face, appear to be too identical and of the
same pattern as to clearly betray their being rehearsed and concocted; and that
the said witnesses could not have identified him because they saw the culprit
for the first time on a fleeting moment and at night time.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not true, however, that the appellant was seen only for a
fleeting moment so that it could not be possible for the said witnesses to
identify him as the culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should
be noted that <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span>,
the victim, had spent some time with him, having been abducted and then raped
by the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
prosecution witnesses were one in identifying the appellant by his pock-marked
face, would not also justify a conclusion that their testimonies were rehearsed
or concocted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we have pointed out,
the prosecution witnesses had no evil motive to impute the commission of the
crime to the appellant; and besides, the crime was reported to the police
authorities immediately after the appellant had left with his victim, giving no
time for these witnesses to concoct a story against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the identification of the appellant was not based
solely on his physical defect, but by his voice as well, when the appellant
told the women in the house to come out; and when he told the victim's mother, <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> to come down,
after he returned to the house with <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further claims that the testimony of the
prosecution witnesses is incredible because they contradicted each other as to
the gun used by the appellant, in that <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> declared that the gun poked into the wall of their
house was about 98 centimeters long, while <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> stated that the gun of the appellant was about 29
centimeters in length, and even as <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Porbido</span> testified that the appellant had two (2) firearms –
one tucked into his waistband and another slung over his shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This alleged contradiction, if it be so,
refers however to an insignificant detail which would not destroy the
credibility of the said witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has ruled that "it is an accepted rule that the
credibility of a rape victim is not destroyed by some inconsistencies in her
testimony more especially if she is testifying on minor matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, such inconsistencies are to be
expected if a witness is unrehearsed and testifies spontaneously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gozum</span></u> (135 SCRA 295), We <span style="">held </span>that minor inconsistencies in the testimony of a
complainant, a 16–year old girl not accustomed to a public trial, do not affect
her credibility."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the complainant could not have been
raped on the night of 12 March 1980, as claimed by her, because of the
testimony of the physician who examined her the following day that the
lacerations on the complainant's vagina were no longer fresh and bleeding and
in<span style=""> </span>view of the absence of other
physical injuries on the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact, however, that the lacerations on the complainant's
vagina were no longer bleeding when she was examined the day after the
commission of the crime charged d<span style="">oes </span>not
preclude a finding that she was raped in the manner testified to by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the same medical examiner testified
that “it is possible that she lost her virginity on the day before she was
examined.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The absence of other physical injuries on the complainant's body does not also
negate the complainant's testimony that she was raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For rape to be committed, it is not necessary
that there be marks of physical violence on the victim's body.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, did not commit any error in finding
the appellant guilty of the crime for which he was charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity to be paid to the complainant,
however, should be increased to P30,000.00, in line with recent decisions of
the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED
with the modification that the indemnity to be paid to the complainant is
increased to P30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs.</p>
