This petition for review on certiorari presents for review the order 
dated October 30, 1969 of the defunct Court of First Instance of Manila,
 Branch IV, which granted the motion to dismiss the complaint of 
petitioners in Civil Case No. 75391 on the ground that the same failed 
to state a cause of action (p. 16, rec.; pp. 1, 100, CFI rec.).
<p>
The undisputed facts are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    On January 17, 1969, petitioners filed a complaint for the exercise 
of preferential rights with the then Court of First Instance of Manila, 
Branch IV, docketed as Civil Case No. 75391 (p. 32, rec.; p. 1, CFI 
rec.).
  </p>
  <p> The said complaint alleged that petitioner association has for its
 members Nicolas Aglabay, et al., named and listed in Annex "A" of said 
complaint, which members are heads of 110 tenant families, and who have 
been, for more than ten years prior to 1959, occupants of a parcel of 
land (with their 110 houses built thereon), formerly owned by the 
respondent, Juliana Diez vda. de Gabriel, to whom petitioners have been 
paying rents for the lease thereof, but who, on May 14, 1968, without 
notice to petitioners, sold the same to respondent Carlos Dimayuga, who,
 in turn, mortgaged the same to her for the balance of the purchase 
price; that according to Republic Act 1162, as amended by Republic Act 
2342, a parcel of land in Manila and suburbs, with at least fifty (50) 
houses of tenants erected thereon and actually leased to said tenants 
for at least ten (10) years prior to June 20, 1959, may not be sold by 
the landowner to any person other than such tenants, unless the latter 
renounced their rights in a public instrument; that without said 
tenants-petitioners having renounced their preferential rights in public
 instrument, respondent Vda. de Gabriel sold the land to respondent 
Dimayuga; that petitioners-tenants are willing to purchase said land at 
the same price and on the same terms and conditions observed in the 
contract of sale with respondent Dima­yuga; and that since aforesaid 
contract of sale is expressly prohibited by law, the same is null and 
void, while it is mandatory for respondent Vda. de Gabriel to execute 
such sale to petitioners. Petitioners therefore prayed that said 
contract of sale be declared void, and that respondent Vda. de Gabriel 
be ordered to execute a deed of sale in favor of petitioners at the same
 price and conditions followed in the contract with respondent Dimayuga,
 plus attorney's fees and damages (p. 32, rec.; p. 1, CFI rec.). </p>
  <p>
    On January 31, 1969, respondent Vda. de Gabriel filed a motion to 
dismiss on the ground that the complaint stated no cause of action 
because the land subject of the complaint is not a landed estate, and 
not being such, the same cannot be expropriated, and not being 
expropriable, no preferential rights could be availed of by the tenants 
(p. 41, rec.; p. 22, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p> Respondent Dimayuga filed his answer to afore­said complaint on 
February 6, 1969 admitting therein certain factual allegations, denied 
some averments, interposed the affirmative defenses that plaintiffs had 
no personality to initiate the action since the Land Tenure 
Administration possessed the power to institute the proper expropriation
 proceedings before the competent court and that the subject complaint 
stated no cause of action against respondent, alleged a counterclaim to 
eject plaintiffs from the property, and prayed for the dismissal of the 
complaint and other remedies (p. 44, rec.; p. 155, CFI rec.). </p>
  <p>
    On February 6, 1969, plaintiffs-petitioners filed their opposition 
to the motion to dismiss, maintaining, among others, that Republic Act 
1162, as amended by Republic Act 2342 (law which respondent Vda. de 
Gabriel invoked), does not necessarily refer to landed estates, but to 
any piece of land occupied by more than 50 families leasing the same for
 more than ten (10) years prior to June 20, 1959; that their 
preferential rights are independent of the expropriability of the land; 
that therefore, said rights may be exercised even if the land is not 
expropriable; and that these rights were granted pursuant to the police 
power of the State for the general welfare, with prayer that aforesaid 
motion to dismiss be denied (p. 47, rec.; p. 26, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 13, 1969, respondent Vda. de Gabriel replied to the 
aforesaid opposition to motion to dismiss, reiterating therein her 
prayer to dismiss the complaint (p. 57, rec.; p. 38, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p> Plaintiffs-petitioners filed their rejoinder to above reply to 
their opposition on February 19, 1969, laying emphasis on the alleged 
distinction between the two ways of acquiring occupied land under 
Republic Act 1162, which are expropriation and voluntary disposal of the
 land by the owner thereof, and which are exercisable independently of 
each other (p. 56, rec.; p. 42, CFI rec.). </p>
  <p>
    On October 30, 1969, Branch IV of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila issued the subject order which found respondent's motion to 
dismiss well-taken and thereby dismissed the complaint (p. 69, rec.; p. 
100, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p>
    Petitioners moved for reconsideration of the aforecited order on 
January 7, 1970, which motion was denied in the lower court's order of 
January 27, 1970 (p. 111, 190, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 9, 1970, petitioners filed a notice of appeal with the 
lower court to which respondent Vda. de Gabriel moved for dismissal of 
the same on February 11, 1970 on the alleged ground that pursuant to 
Republic Act 5440, petitioners should have appealed from the questioned 
order by way of a petition for certiorari to this Court since the matter
 involved only errors or questions of law (p. 143, CFI rec.).
  </p>
  <p> After a series of motions, reply, rejoinder, surrejoinder, and 
answer between both parties, the lower court issued its order of May 11,
 1970 dismiss­ing petitioners' appeal (p. 225, CFI rec.). </p>
  <p>
  Petitioners thus resorted to this petition.
  </p>
  <p>
  Petitioners contend that the lower court committed an error in 
dismissing their complaint on the ground that since the land is not 
expropriable, it follows that the tenants therein have no preferential 
rights to buy said land, it the same is sold voluntarily. Petitioners' 
contention is anchored on the amendment introduced by Republic Act 3516 
into Section 1 of Republic Act 1162, which latter law had been invoked 
in the decision of the lower court.
  </p>
  <p> According to petitioners, the phrase "any landed estates or 
haciendas herein authorized to be expropriated" had been amended to read
 "any landed estates or haciendas or lands herein authorized to be 
expropriated"; hence, Republic Act 1162 does not refer exclusively to 
landed estates or haciendas, but even to smaller lands. The particular 
section as amended reads thus: </p>
  <p> "The expropriation of landed estates or haciendas, or lands which 
formerly formed part thereof, or any piece of land in the City of 
Manila, Quezon City and suburbs, which have been and are actually being 
leased to tenants for at least ten years, is hereby authorized: <em>Provided</em>, That such lands shall have at least forty families of tenants thereon." (Sec. 1 of R.A. 3516). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioners likewise invoke the amended title of Republic Act 1162 which
 had been introduced by Republic Act 2342 which title now reads as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "An Act Providing for the Expropriation of Landed Estates or Haciendas or Lands Which Formerly Formed Part Thereof or <em>Any Piece of Land</em>
 in the City of Manila, Quezon City and Suburbs, Their Subdivision into 
Small Lots, and the Sale of Such Lots at Cost or Their Lease on 
Reasonable Terms, and for Other Purposes" (Italics supplied). </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Petitioners further allege that Republic Act 1162 is both an 
exercise of the power of eminent domain and the police power of the 
State. The exercise of the police power of the State refers to the grant
 of preferential rights to the tenants of such land, if the same is 
disposed of voluntarily. Simply stated, petitioners theorize that 
Republic Act 1162 covers both compulsory and voluntary sale; hence, 
while expropriability is pertinent to compulsory sale, the same does not
 relate to voluntary sale. Even if the land is not expropriable, if the 
same is however actually leased to the occupants for more than ten years
 prior to May 22, 1963 (when R.A. 3516 took effect) with at least 40 
families, said land, if sold voluntarily, is subject to the preferential
 rights of the tenants.
  </p>
<p> Respondent Vda. de Gabriel maintains, on the other hand, that there 
is no more issue regarding the non-expropriability of subject land, 
which condition or status was expressly admitted by petitioners in the 
lower court; that the title of Republic Act 1162, as amended by Republic
 Act Nos. 2342 and 3516 clearly embraces expropriation; that the 
prohibitive acts enumerated in Section 5 of R.A. 1162, as amended, are 
entirely dependent on the expropriability of the land in controversy; 
that there is nothing in the aforecited law which validly supports the 
alleged preferential right of petitioners to purchase the property at 
the same price and under the same conditions; that the only reasonable 
interpretation of the opening lines of Section 5 of Republic Act 1162, 
as amended, is that pending expropriation, the landowner shall not sell 
the land to any other person than the tenant or occupant unless the 
latter renounces his rights in a public instrument; but if the land is 
not expropriable, as petitioners have admitted, the prohibition does not
 apply; and that clearly, from the provision of Section 6 of the amended
 law, Section 5 thereof may be violated only if the land is "herein 
authorized to be expropriated" and since petitioners have admitted the 
non-expropriability of subject land, it necessarily follows that said 
Section 5 cannot apply. </p>
<p>
    Respondent Dimayuga avers that Section 9, in relation to the title 
of R.A. 1162, clearly provides that the preferential right could be 
exercised only when the land under question is subject to expropriation,
 or better still, if the tenanted property which formerly formed part of
 an hacienda or is a landed estate, had been expropriated; and, that 
R.A. 1162, as amended, embraces only landed estates or haciendas with an
 extensive area.
  </p>
<p>
    The sole issue raised by petitioners is whether or not they have the
 pre-emptive or preferential rights to buy the land in question.
  </p>
<p>
WE find for petitioners.
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center">
    I
  </p>
  <p>
    The third proviso in Section 5 of Republic Act 3516, which law further amended R.A. 1162, reads:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Provided, furthermore, That no lot or portion thereof actually 
occupied by a tenant or occupant shall be sold by the landowner to any 
other person than such tenant or occupant, unless the latter renounce in
 a public instrument his rights under this Act: Pro­vided, finally, That
 if there shall be tenants who have constructed bona fide improvements 
on the lots leased by them, the rights of these tenants should be 
recognized in the sale or in the lease of the lots, the limitation as to
 area in Section three notwithstanding."
    </p>
    <p> The provision clearly defines the preferential right of herein 
petitioners to buy the parcel of land. It should be noted that 
respondent Vda. de Gabriel voluntarily sold the land to respondent 
Dimayuga without informing the petitioners of the transaction. 
Respondent Vda. de Gabriel did not give the first offer to petitioners 
who were then tenants-lessees and who would have either accepted or 
refused to buy the land in a public document. The fact is that on 
discovery of the sale to respondent Dimayuga, petitioners filed their 
original claim for preferential rights eight months after the 
clandestine sale. Thus, the condition set forth in the aforesaid proviso
 -- that of offering first the sale of the land to petitioners and the 
latter's renunciation in a public instrument -- ­were not met when the 
land was sold to respondent Dimayuga. Evidently, said sale was made 
illegally and, therefore, void. Petitioners have still the first option 
to buy the land as provided for in the above provision. </p>
  </blockquote>

    II
  </p>
  <p>
    A brief run-down of this Court's decisions easily reveal the 
adherence to the principle that the test for a valid expropriation of 
private land for resale to its occupants, is the number of families to 
be benefited thereby, and not the area.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his book on Constitutional Law, Dean Isagani Cruz recapitulates thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In the earlier case of <em>Rural Progress Administration v. Reyes</em>,
 the Supreme Court held that the criterion for determining the validity 
of expropriation under this provision was not the area of the land 
sought to be taken <em>but the number of people intended to be benefited</em> thereby. <em>The land,</em> in other words, <em>could be small provided it was tenanted by a sizable number of people</em>. </p>
  <p> "This ruling was abandoned in the case of <em>Guido v. Rural Progress Administration</em>, where the Supreme Court declared, also by a split decision as in the <em>Reyes case</em>, that <em>the test</em> to be applied <em>was the area of the land</em> and <em>not the number of people who stood to be benefitted</em> by the expropriation. <em>The land should be a landed estate</em> or one comprising <em>a very vast area.</em>
 It was stressed that one of the purposes of the framers was precisely 
to break up these estates in the hands of only a few individuals or 
families and thus more equitably distribute them among the landless. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "It has also been held that where a landed estate is broken up 
unto reasonable portions which are thereafter sold to separate 
purchasers, the resultant portions cannot be deemed as still subject to 
expropriation under this provision simply because they used to form part
 of a landed estate. </p>
  <p> "In the case of <em>Tuason v. PHHC</em>, which was a petition for prohibition to nullify a law directing the expropriation of Tatalon Estate in Quezon City, <em>Justice
 Fernando suggested a return to the Reyes ruling, arguing that the 
propriety of expropriation 'could not be determined on a purely 
quanti­tative or area basis</em>,' quoting from Justice J.B.L. Reyes in his dissenting opinion in the <em>Baylosis Case</em>. xx xx" (p. 71, 1983 Ed.; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
From the Reyes case where the number of beneficiaries test was applied 
in determining public use down to the Guido and Baylosis cases where the
 land or area size test was invoked, then to the Tuason case where a 
return to the Reyes decision was made and then up to the recent case of 
Pulido vs. Court of Appeals (L-57625, May 3, 1983; 122 SCRA 63) where 
this Court found it "unfortunate that petitioner would be deprived of 
his land holdings, but his interest and that of his family should not 
stand in the way of progress and the benefit of the greater majority of 
the inhabitants of the country," there has evolved a clear pattern of 
adherence to the "number of people to be benefited test."
</p><p>
This is made more manifest by the new con­stitutional provisions on the 
equitable diffusion of property ownership and profits (Sec. 6, Art. II) 
and the implementation of an agrarian reform program aimed at 
emancipating the tenant from the bondage of the soil (Sec. 12, Art. 
XIV).
</p><p>
It has been noted with concern that while respondents raised the issue 
of expropriability of the parcel of land, petitioners limited themselves
 to the issue of preferential or pre-emptive rights.
</p><p>
What petitioners might have failed to realize is that had they invoked 
the expropriability of subject land, they would have had a foolproof 
case. Right from the start, they would have had the upper hand. 
Ironically, however, instead of anchoring their case on the 
expropriability of such land, they concentrated on asserting their 
preferential right to buy the land. For, Section 1 of R.A. 1162, as 
amended by R.A. 3516, specifically authorizes the expropriation of <em>any piece of land in the City of Manila, Quezon City and suburbs which have been and are actually being leased</em>
 to tenants for at least ten (10) years, provided said lands have at 
least forty families of tenants thereon. The case at bar comes within 
the coverage of the aforesaid legal provision since the parcel of land 
is located in Manila which was then actually leased to 110 tenant 
families 20 years prior to the commencement of this action in the lower 
court. Clearly, therefore, the land in question is capable of 
expropriation.
</p><p>
The above situation now brings Us back to the case of J.M. Tuason &amp; 
Co. vs. Land Tenure Administration (L-21064, Feb. 18, 1970, 31 SCRA 
413-417) where this Court laid down certain basic doctrines on the power
 of eminent domain. Thus, this Court, speaking thru then Justice 
Fernando, declared:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It does not admit of doubt that the congressional power conferred
 by the Constitution is far from limited. It is left to the legislative 
will to determine what lands may be expropriated so that they could be 
subdivided for resale to those in need of them. Nor can it be doubted 
either that as to when such authority may be exercised is purely for 
Congress to decide. Its discretion on the matter is not to be interfered
 with. This is shown by reference to the historical basis of the 
provision as reflected in the proceedings of the Constitutional 
Convention. </p>
  <p> "Historical discussion while valuable is not necessarily decisive.
 It is easy to understand why. The social and economic conditions are 
not static. They change with the times. To identify the text of a 
written constitution with the circumstances that inspired its inclusion 
may render it incapable of being responsive to future needs. Precisely, 
it is assumed to be one of the virtues of a written constitution that it
 suffices to govern the life of the people not only at the time of its 
fram­ing but far into the indefinite future. It is not to be considered 
as so lacking in flexibility and suppleness that it may be a bar to 
measures, novel and unorthodox, as they may appear to some, but 
nonetheless imperatively called for. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "The framers of the Consti­tution were seriously concerned with 
the grave problems of inequality of wealth, with its highly divisive 
tendency, result­ing in the generous scope accorded the police power and
 eminent domain prerogatives of the state, even if the exercise thereof 
would cover terrain of property right previously thought of as beyond 
state control, to promote social justice and the general welfare. </p>
  <p> "As in the case of the more general provision on eminent domain, 
the power to expropriate lands under Sec. 4 of Art. XIII of the 
Constitution requires the payment of just compensation, the taking to be
 for the public use, and to meet the exacting standard of due process 
and equal protection guaranty of the Constitution. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "The power granted to Congress by the Constitution to 'authorize, 
upon payment of just compensation, the expropriation of lands to be 
subdivided into small lots and conveyed at cost to in­dividuals' is 
unlimited by any other provision of the Constitution. Just compensation 
is in reality a part of the power granted rather than a limitation 
thereto, just as just compensation is of the essence in any exercise of 
the power of eminent domain, as, otherwise it would be plain 
commandeering. </p>
  <p> "While the taking must be for public use as a matter of principle,
 in the judicial proceeding, the Government need not present evidence of
 such public use as a fact. The constitutional provision itself declares
 the public objective, purpose or use of the expropriation contemplated,
 hence, it should follow that as long as a congressional legislation 
declares a the condemnation of particular land is for the specific 
purpose stated in the Constitution, it is not for the judiciary to 
inquire as to whether or not the taking of such land is for public use. 
The Constitution itself which is supposed to be the supreme law on 
private property rights declares it to be so, and leaves it to Congress,
 not to the judiciary, to make the choice of the lands to be taken to 
attain the objective the constituent assembly aimed to achieve. The 
scope and the limit of the power of the judiciary in this regard is only
 to determine the existence of enabling legislation, to see to it that 
the facts are as contemplated in such enabling act and to provide the 
vehicle for compliance with procedural due process in the implementation
 of the congressional act."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the matter of taking for public use, Chief Justice Fernando summarily observes:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The taking to be valid must be for public use. There was a time 
when it was felt that a literal meaning should be attached to such a 
requirement. Whatever project is undertaken must be for the public to 
enjoy, as in the case of streets or parks. Otherwise, expropriation is 
not allowable. It is not so any more. As long as the purpose of the 
taking is public, then the power of eminent domain comes into play. As 
just noted, the Constitution in at least two cases, to remove any doubt,
 determines what is public use. One is the expro­priation of lands to be
 subdi­vided into small lots for resale at cost to individuals. The 
other is the transfer, through the exercise of this power, of utilities 
and other private enterprise to the government. It is accurate to state 
then that at present whatever may be beneficially employed for the 
general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use" (The 
Constitution of the Philippines, 2nd Ed., 1977, pp. 523-24). </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
III
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    This preferential right of petitioners and the power of eminent 
domain have been further mandated, strengthened and expanded by recent 
developments in law and jurisprudence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It must be recalled that the 1973 Constitution embodies certain original
 and innovative provisions on eminent domain. The new Constitution 
provides thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation" (Sec. 2, Art. IV). </p>
  <p> "The Batasang Pambansa may authorize, upon payment of just 
compensation, the expropriation of private lands to be subdivided into 
small lots and conveyed at cost to deserving citizens" (Sec. 13, Art. 
XIV). </p>
  <p> "The State shall promote social justice to ensure the dignity, welfare and security of all the people. Toward this end, <em>the
 State shall regulate the acquisition, ownership, use, enjoyment, and 
disposition of private property, and equitably diffuse property 
ownership and profits</em>" (Sec. 6, Art. II; Italics supplied). </p>
  <p> "The State shall establish, maintain, and ensure adequate social 
services in the field of education, health, housing, employment, 
welfare, and social security to guarantee the enjoyment by the people of
 a decent standard of living" (Sec. 7, Art. II). </p>
  <p> "The State shall formulate and implement an agrarian reform 
program aimed at emancipating the tenant from the bondage of the soil 
and achieving the goals enunciated in this Constitution" (Sec. 12, Art. 
XIV). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The aforequoted Section 6 of Article II, which is a modified version of 
the original provision of the 1935 Constitution, "emphasizes the 
stewardship concept, under which private property is supposed to be held
 by the individual only as a trustee for the people in general, who are 
its real owners. As a mere steward, the individual must exercise his 
rights to the property not for his own exclusive and selfish benefit but
 for the good of the entire community or nation" (p. 70, Phil. Political
 Law, Cruz, 1983 ed.).
</p><p>
In the case of Almeda vs. Court of Appeals, et al. (L-43800, 78 SCRA 194 [July 29, 1977]), this Court thus declared:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is to be noted that under the new Constitution, property 
ownership is impressed with social function. Property use must not only 
be for the benefit of the owner but of society as well. The State, in 
the promotion of social justice, may 'regulate the acquisition, 
ownership, use, enjoyment and disposition of private property, and 
equitably diffuse property -- ownership and profits.' One governmental 
policy of recent date projects the emancipation of tenants from the 
bondage of the soil and the transfer to them of the ownership of the 
land they till."
  </p>
  <p> "The Legislature may regulate 'the acquisi­tion, ownership, use, 
enjoyment and disposition of private property,' to the end that maximum 
advantage can be derived from it by the people as a whole. Thus, it may 
limit the size of private landholdings, impose higher taxes on 
agricultural lands that are not being tilled, or provide for a wider 
distribution of land among the landless. xx" (p. 70, Phil. Political 
Law, Cruz, 1983 ed.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is obviously in the spirit of Sections 6 and 7 of Article II that 
P.D. No. 1517 on urban land reform was enacted and the subsequent 
implementing Proclamation No. 1967 was issued. Significantly also, the 
latest amendment to the Constitution on urban land reform and social 
housing program which has been proclaimed by the President as having 
been approved in the recent plebiscite on January 17, 1984 all the more 
emphasizes and strengthens the constitutional base for urban land reform
 consistent with the provisions on social justice.
</p><p>
Even as We have consistently and explicitly pronounced that the power of
 eminent domain is a basic and inherent power of government which does 
not have to be spelled out by the Constitution, still our legislators 
felt such urgent demands for redistribution of land in this country that
 they had to incorporate into the 1935 and 1973 Constitutions a specific
 provision on expropriation of land for resale. Section 13, Article IV 
of the 1973 Constitution, specially authorizes the expropriation of 
private lands for resale.
</p><p>
Thus, as earlier mentioned, P.D. No. 1517 entitled "Proclaiming Urban 
Land Reform in the Philippines and Providing for the Implementing 
Machinery Thereof" was enacted and became effective on June 11, 1978 and
 Proclamation No. 1967 was issued on May 14, 1980 as an implementing 
law. This decree, which is firmly based on Section 6, Article II of the 
new Constitution, undoubtedly adopts and crystallizes the greater number
 of people criterion when it speaks of tenants and residents in declared
 urban land reform zones or areas without any mention of the land area 
covered by such zones. The focus, therefore, is on people who would 
stand to benefit and not on the size of the land involved.
</p><p>
It should now be clarified that Section 22 of the aforecited decree declares thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 22. <em>Repealing Clause</em>. All laws, decrees, executive 
orders, rules and regulations inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed,
 amended or modified accordingly."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The decree has, therefore, superseded R.A. Nos. 1162, 2342 and 3516.
</p><p>
The issue of pre-emptive or preferential rights still remains for Our resolution within the purview of the said decree.
</p><p>
The pertinent provisions of P.D. No. 1517 are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 4. <em>Proclamation of Urban Land Reform Zones</em>. The 
President shall proclaim specific parcels of urban and urbanizable lands
 as Urban Land Reform Zones, otherwise known as Urban Zones for purposes
 of this Decree, which may include Bagong Lipunan Sites, as defined in 
P.D. 1396" (par. 1 of the section). </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "Sec. 6. <em>Land Tenancy in Urban Land Reform Areas. Within the 
Urban Zones legitimate tenants who have resided on the land for ten 
years or more who have built their homes</em> on the land and residents <em>who
 have legally occupied the lands by contract, continuously for the last 
ten years shall not be dispossessed of the land and shall be allowed the
 right of first refusal to purchase the same within a reasonable time 
and at reasonable prices</em>, under terms and conditions to be 
deter­mined by the Urban Zone Expro­priation and Land Management 
Committee created by Section 8 of the Decree. </p>
  <p align="center">
    xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</p>
  <p> "Sec. 9. <em>Compulsory Declaration of Sale and Pre­emptive 
Rights. Upon the proclamation by the President of an area as an Urban 
Land Reform Zone, all landowners, tenants and residents there­upon are 
required to declare to the Ministry any proposal to sell</em>, lease or encumber lands and improvements thereon, <em>including the proposed price</em>, rent or value of encumbrances <em>and secure approval of said proposed transactions</em>. </p>
  <p> "The Ministry shall have the preemptive right to acquire the 
above-mentioned lands and improvements thereon which shall include, but 
shall not be limited to lands occupied by tenants as provided for in 
Section 6 of this Decree" (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Pursuant to the above decree and for purposes of making specific the 
applicability of the same and other subsequent laws on the matter, <em>the President issued Proclamation No. 1967 dated May 14, 1980 declaring Metropolitan Manila Area as Urban Land Reform Zone</em>. Thus, on page 2, No. 14 of said proclama­tion, <em>Mataas na Lupa</em>,
 the land in controversy, (an area bounded on the northwest by Quirino 
Avenue, South Super­highway on the east, San Andres Street on the south,
 and on the west, by Anak Bayan Street) <em>was declared as an area for priority development and urban land reform zone</em>.
</p><p>
The aforequoted provisions of P.D. 1517 and the declaration in the 
aforesaid proclamation are clear and leave no room for any 
interpretation. Evidently, petitioners' case falls squarely within the 
law. Under Section 6 of the decree, the 110 tenant-families have been 
vested with the right of first refusal to purchase the land in question 
within a reasonable time and reasonable prices, subject to Ministry of 
Human Settlements rules and regulations.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, THE ORDER DATED OCTOBER 30, 1969 OF THE THEN MANILA COURT OF 
FIRST INSTANCE, BRANCH IV, IS HEREBY SET ASIDE AND THE MINISTRY OF HUMAN
 SETTLEMENTS IS HEREBY DIRECTED TO FACILITATE AND ADMINISTER THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RIGHTS OF HEREIN PETITIONERS. COSTS AGAINST 
RESPONDENTS.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero,</em> and <em>Escolin, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, J</em>., in the result.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J.,</em> reserve his vote.
