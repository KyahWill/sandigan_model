Personnel Officer (petitioners in G.R. No. 80407) and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> (petitioner in G.R. No. 79731) both ask us to set
aside and nullify the Resolution of the National Labor Relations Commission
("NLRC") in RAB Case No. VI-0030-85 which had affirmed a Decision of
the Executive Labor Arbiter requiring <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Navigation and its Personnel Officer to pay Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>
separation pay amounting to his one-month salary for every year of service,
plus ten percent (10%) thereof as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> had been employed as a <span class="SpellE">messman</span> by <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation
since January 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On Christmas day of
1984, <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> was assigned as <span class="SpellE">messman</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation's vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>M/S "Sta. Maria".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "Sta. Maria" was then berthed
at the <span class="SpellE">Muelle</span> <span class="SpellE">Loney</span> wharf
in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the vessel's home port, receiving passengers and cargo bound for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the vessel's departure being then scheduled for <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time> in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">messman</span> <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> arrived at the
vessel's lobby, with his authorized uniform tucked out (rather than tucked in)
with front unbuttoned thus baring his chest and stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was obviously drunk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without <span class="GramE">provocation,</span>
and in the presence of some of the vessel's officers including the Chief Mate,
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>, Jr., crew members and passengers,
he became very belligerent and in a loud and angry voice challenged everyone
present to fight with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> sought to pacify him, but he refused to be
pacified and instead insulted and challenged the Chief Mate in front of
everyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After sometime, <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> disembarked from the vessel and while descending the
gangplank, continued to shout at and challenge all and sundry on shipboard to
come down and fight with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The "Sta. Maria" left the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename></st1:place> at the scheduled
hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the vessel was on its way to
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, the Chief Mate was informed
that <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> was on board the vessel, sleeping off his
liquor inside his quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
apprehensive that <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> might cause further trouble,
the Chief Mate instructed the Chief Steward, who was <span class="SpellE">Lausa's</span>
immediate supervisor, as well as the Boatswain, to see to it that <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> did not leave his quarters and immediately to report
any sign of further trouble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief
Mate then prepared a brief report on the behavior of <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>,
with a view to submitting the same to his superiors in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename>

</span><span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> denied the material allegations of the

was Chief Mate Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>, Jr. who had been
listening and prying into our marital argument for a considerable length of
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that incident, nothing more
happened, and we parted ways, probably he realized that it was his fault in
interfering with our marital argument and he was the one who provoked me to say
those <span class="GramE">kind</span> of words to him.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The next morning, I met Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>,

me to forget everything that had happened, because it was nobody's fault anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presuming that everything was all right, I

other things, illegal dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conciliation proceedings were had, but without success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After submission of the parties’ <span style="">respective position papers and supporting

<span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> had been illegally dismissed and required the
employer and its Personnel Officer to pay him separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of this decision read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, we find that respondents' act in
dismissing the complainant is arbitrary and does not constitute a just cause
for respondent to separate him from work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We believe that the alleged serious misconduct is not attend­ant in the
instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If ever complainant
committed <span class="GramE">a misconduct</span> it was not serious as to
warrant his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Though we find
the termination to be illegal, the remedy of reinstatement in the instant case
is not in the best interest of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;

rupture or severe breakdown of employer-employee relationship (Mario <span class="SpellE">Libunao</span> vs. Olympia International Inc., NLRC Case No. RB

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation, et al. and <span class="SpellE">messman</span> <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> appealed separately

Navigation, et al. contended that the Executive Labor Arbiter had seriously
erred in giving credence to the uncorroborated version of <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>
of the relevant events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>, upon the other hand, appealed from the Executive
Labor Arbiter's Decision to the extent that it had awarded him separation pay
instead of reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, arguing that
his non-reinstate­ment <u>cum</u> separation <span style="">pay </span>was inconsistent with the finding
that he was not guilty of serious misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp;

the NLRC dismissed both appeals for lack of merit, and accordingly sustaining,
in all its parts, the Decision of the Executive Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Both <span class="SpellE">Negros</span></span>
Navigation, et al. and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> are now before
us on <i>certiorari</i>, ascribing grave abuse of discretion to the NLRC in
rendering its aforementioned Resolution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation, et al.’s principal
contentions are two-fold:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the NLRC
acted with grave abuse of discretion in, firstly, disregarding the evidence
submitted by them while accepting the allegations of <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>;
and secondly, in holding that <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> had not committed
serious misconduct and had not given just cause for termination of his
services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>,
on the other hand, contends that the NLRC acted with grave abuse of discretion
in, firstly, terminating his services and giving him separation pay instead of
ordering his reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> after
having found that he was not guilty of serious misconduct; and secondly, in not
awarding him moral and exemplary damages when there was legal basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the records shows that both the Executive Labor
Arbiter and public respondent NLRC had indeed rejected the evidence presented
by <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation, et al. in arriving at their
respective assailed decisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
particular, the NLRC, following the conclusions of the Executive Labor Arbiter,
disregarded the report dated <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="12">26
 December 1984</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the affidavits dated <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="1">21 January
 1985</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="4">30 April 1985</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
all executed by Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> upon the ground
that the report and affidavits were inconsistent with each other in their
material averments.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have, however, examined these report and affidavits for
ourselves and find no material inconsistencies between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the Executive Labor Arbiter, we find
no necessary contradiction between the statement in the report of Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> of 26 December 1984 that he "immediately
apprehended" the complainant upon the latter's drunken and belligerent
behavior and the statement in the Chief Mate's affidavit that he "tried to
pacify" respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> since the
"apprehension" or restraint of <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> was
precisely intended to "pacify" him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Executive Labor Arbiter also pointed to the fact that the report
dated 26 December 1984 and the affidavit of 21 January 1985 did not set out the
"exact utterance of the complainant", while the affidavit dated 30
April 1985, did set out such utterance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Executive Labor Arbiter apparently concluded that the subsequent
affidavit was false or unreliable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do
not <span style="">believe so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note that the subsequent affidavit of 30
April 1985 is cast in question-and-answer form and that the affiant, Chief Mate
<span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>, was asked by the administering officer
what <span class="SpellE">messman</span> <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> had
stated and that, accordingly, the Chief Mate in response repeated as far as he
remembered the language employed by <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC had also stated that there was some delay in the

Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> hand-carried his report to his
superiors in <span style="">the office of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">petitioner
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, as the Labor Arbiter
stated, that Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> might have
forwarded his report to the home office earlier than 31 December 1984, we do
not understand how the failure to do so could have diminished the intrinsic
credibility of the report which was rendered in the ordinary course of business
and in the performance of duty on the part of Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Executive Labor Arbiter sought to justify rejection
of the affidavits executed by several crew members of the "Sta.
Maria" corroborating and reinforcing the report and affidavits of Chief
Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>, upon the ground that those affidavits
had been executed "by practically [sic] all men under the direct
supervision and control of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span>, Jr., except
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Codilla</span> who did nothing while the alleged
incident was taking place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, if
witnesses should undertake to tell all that occurred in precisely the same
order, each giving the same incident as the order in precisely the same words,
that fact would be itself <span class="GramE">a suspicious circumstances</span> [sic]
(People v. Lopez, L-12704, September 30, 1961)".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no evidence whatsoever <span style="">to
suggest that Chief Mate <span class="SpellE">Tendencia</span> coerced the
affiants -- Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Seruelo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Momboy</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mondadero</span> and </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Palma</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> -- to perjure <span class="GramE">themselves</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that these crew members may have
narrated the <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> incident giving substantially the
same sequence of events and using substantially similar <span class="GramE">words,</span>
is certainly not sufficient basis to exclude such evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, these affidavits were subscribed to
on the same date before the same notary public, who very probably drafted <span class="GramE">them</span> using substantially similar words in English, after the
affiants had described what they had seen of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the affiants and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> belonged to the same labor union, the Iloilo-<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Employees and Laborers Union (INELU).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the record to explain why
affiants would have fabricated out of thin air the whole incident which clearly
would lead to imposition of sanctions against a fellow union member.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We are thus compelled to conclude that clearly relevant evidence
for <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation, et al. was, without rational
basis, excluded and disregarded by both the Executive Labor Arbiter and the
NLRC and that such failure to consider material evidence of record constitutes a
grave abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the question of whether or not the drunken behavior of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> constituted misconduct <span class="GramE">so</span> serious as reasonably to warrant his dismissal from the
service of petitioner corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Executive Labor Arbiter undertook to substitute his own judgment for that of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> in this respect, holding that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"if ever complainant committed a
misconduct, it was not [so] serious as to warrant his dismissal".<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly, the drunken and bellicose
behavior of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> constituted misconduct on
his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The critical question relates
to appreciation of the gravity of such misconduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In appraising the character of the misconduct
committed by <span class="SpellE">messman</span> <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>,
it is important to stress that petitioner corporation is a public carrier,
engaged in transporting passengers and cargo across <span style="">our </span>waters and <span style="">seas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a public carrier, <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> is, “from the nature of [its] business and for reasons of
public policy", bound to observe "extraordinary diligence" in </span>the
<span style="">vigilance over the goods and for the
safety of passengers transported by it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The standard of care established by </span>the
Civil Code -- extraordinary diligence -- is defined rigorously as a duty
"to carry passengers safely <u>as far as human care and foresight can
provide</u>, using the <u>utmost diligence of very cautious persons</u>, with a
due regard for all the circumstances."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In the context of this duty of extraordinary diligence imposed by law upon <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>, the drunken and disorderly and
pugnacious behavior of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> on board the
vessel was clearly <span style="">a </span>serious
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such kind of behavior could
easily have provoked or triggered off a brawl and mindless panic on board the
vessel, and endangered the safety of passengers and crew members and, under
certain conditions, the safety of the vessel itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that, in<span style=""> </span>the case at bar, no violence and terror and panic actually
broke out on board <span style="">the M/S </span>"Sta.
Maria", was certainly not due to Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, we consider that
the behavior of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> is properly
characterized as serious misconduct warranting his dismissal from the service.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The statutory duty of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation of
extraordinary diligence would have justified, indeed required, the Chief Mate
and other crew members of the "Sta. Maria" to take reasonable
measures to apprehend and restrain <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> to ensure
that no such panic and stampede resulted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation was moreover
justified in taking into account, in dismissing respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>,
the fact that the <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="12">25 December 1984</st1:date>
drunken incident was not the first such serious misconduct on the part of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence submitted by <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation,
et al. showed that on 27 September 1980, on board the M/S “<span class="SpellE">Doña</span>
<span class="SpellE">Florentina</span>” where he was previously assigned,
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> and other crew members were caught
playing cards (Lucky 9) and that under the influence of <span class="SpellE">liqour</span>,
and having lost money in the game, he provoked a fight in the course of which
he inflicted physical injuries upon one of the card players whom he chased and
slashed with a broken bottle.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation would have dismissed <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> back in 1980 had the union not intervened on his
behalf and promised that next time, it would not so intervene.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span><span style="">hold that, in the specific
circumstances of this case, respondent NLRC and the Executive Labor Arbiter
committed a grave abuse of discretion in substituting their own judgment for
that of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Navigation who could have been held
liable for damages if any of the passengers had been hurt as a result of the
drunken misbehavior of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the dismissal of Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span>
was for a just cause, he was not entitled to separation pay,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
