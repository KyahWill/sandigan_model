 29, 1974</st1:date> and issued pursuant to the authority granted under Act No.
2655, as amended (The Usury Law), and prescribing that:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx the rate of interest for the
loan, or forbearance of any money, goods, or credits and the rate allowed in
judgments, in the absence of express contract as to such rate of interest,
shall be twelve (12%) percent per annum,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">is</span> applicable to
the decision of respondent court dated <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="12">December
 28, 1970</st1:date> in Civil Case No. 11973 entitled "Eastern <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> VTPA, Inc., et al. v. Phil. - Virginia Tobacco
Administration, et al."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on various dates in 1963 the private respondents,
who are farmers’ cooperatives, delivered to the Central Cooperative Exchange,
Inc. (CCE, for brevity) in the latter's <span class="SpellE">redrying</span>
plant at <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union, <span class="GramE">certain</span>
quantities of tobacco under particular <span class="SpellE">guias</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, CCE had a management contract
with petitioner under which it obligated itself to procure, <span class="SpellE">redry</span>
and service Virginia Tobacco for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">petitioner </span>and to advance the payment of the

 24, 1963</st1:date>, a fire destroyed the tobacco shipments of private

therein though still awaiting inspection, grading and weighing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner failed to pay the price of the
burned tobacco, prompting private respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

until fully paid, on the ground that petitioner already had the legal control
and custody of the tobacco shipments and should be deemed to have accepted
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to a writ of execution
issued by the respondent Judge, </span>the funds of the petitioner deposited at
the Philippine National Bank (<span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> Branch) were
garnished by the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City to satisfy
the judgment in favor of the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">did </span>not
agree with the computation of the interest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of 12% </span>per annum based on Central Bank Circular No. 416 and
insisted on the application of the 6% legal rate of interest under Art. 2209 of
the Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"If the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money,
and the debtor incurs in delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no
stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment of interest agreed upon, and
in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest which is six percent per
annum."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, on August 12, 1981, private
respondents filed an <u style="text-underline:words">ex­</u><u>-</u><span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:words">parte</u></span> motion praying
for the issuance of an order fixing the legal rate of interest at 12% per

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Private respondents
maintain that Article 2209 is "merely descriptive of the legal rate and
does not mean that the legal rate will be 6% per annum forever; it was added to
Art. <span class="GramE">2209 because in 1950 when the Civil Code took effect the
prevailing rate was 6%.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now,
however, the prevailing legal rate is 12% per annum <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

further argue that the term "judgments" in CB Circular No. 416 is not
limited to judgments on loans or forbearance of money, or to "interest by
way of earnings" but should apply to all judgments for the payment of a
sum of money (as the law does not distinguish).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The foregoing conclusions
deserve scant consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Applying
the case of <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tomol</span>,
139 SCRA 260, which bears essentially the same issues as in the case at hand,
We hold that Central Bank Circular No. 416 dated July 29, 1974, which fixes the
legal rate of interest at 12% per annum is not applicable here since the
circular applies only to loans or forbearance of money, goods or credits and
court judgment thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in the <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span> case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Central Bank Circular No. 416 which took effect on July 29,
1974 was issued and promulgated by the Monetary Board pursuant to the authority
granted to the Central Bank by P.D. No. 116, which amended Act No. 2655,
otherwise known as the Usury Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
amendment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">from which said authority
emanated reads </span>as follows ?</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">‘Section 1.a.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Monetary Board is hereby authorized to
prescribe the maximum rate or rates of interest for the <u>loan</u> <u>or</u> <u>renewal</u>
<u>thereof</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><u>or</u> <u>the</u>
<u>forbearance</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><u>of</u> <u>any</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><u>money,</u> <u>goods</u> <u>or</u> <u>credits</u>,
and to change such rate or rates whenever warranted by prevailing economic and
social conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> such changes shall not be made oftener than once every
twelve months.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘In the exercise of the authority herein granted, the Monetary
Board may prescribe higher maximum rates for consumer loans or renewals thereof
as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>such
loans made by pawnshops, finance companies and other similar credit institutions
although the rates prescribed for these institutions need not necessarily be
uniform.' (Italics supplied)</p>

<blockquote>"Acting pursuant to this grant of authority, the Monetary
Board increased the rate of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">legal </span>interest
from that of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>(6%)
percent per annum originally allowed under Section 1 of Act No. 2655 to twelve
(12%) percent per annum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will be noted that Act No. 2655 deals with interest on (1)
loans; (2) forbearances of any money, goods, or credits, and (3) rate allowed
in judgments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The issue now is--what kind of judgment is referred to under
the said law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners maintain that
it covers all kinds of monetary judgments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention is devoid of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The judgments spoken of and referred to are judgments in
litigations involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods or credits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any other kind of monetary judgment which has
nothing to do with, nor involving loans or forbearances of any money, goods or
credits does not fall within the coverage of the said law for it is not within
the ambit of the authority granted to the Central Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Monetary Board may not tread on forbidden
grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot rewrite other
laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That function is vested solely
with the legislative authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
axiomatic in legal hermeneutics that statutes should be construed as a whole
and not as a series of disconnected articles and phrases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>clear contrary intention, words and
phrases in statutes should not be interpreted in isolation from one
another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A word or phrase in a statute
is always used in association with other words or phrases and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">its </span>meaning
may thus be modified or restricted by the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span> case was an Action for
Damages for injury to persons and loss of property which was held not to
involve any <span class="GramE">loan,</span> much less forbearance of any money,
goods or credits and therefore the law applicable is Art. <span class="GramE">2209
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Civil </span>Code and not
Central Bank Circular No. 416.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
make the latter law applicable to any case other than those specifically
provided for by the Usury Law would be to violate the principle of undue
delegation of legislative powers since the Monetary Board will be exercising <span class="GramE">legislative functions which was</span> beyond the intendment of
P.D. 116.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no cogent reason to deviate from the <span class="SpellE">Reformina</span>
ruling in this case before <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent transaction here does not also
involve any loan or forbearance of any money, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a contract of sale wherein there was
default in the payment of the price and interest was awarded <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The interest here is therefore not within the
contemplation of the Usury Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Thus, Art.</span> 2209 is the law applicable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the position of private respondents that the term
"judgments" in Central Bank Circular No. 416 is not limited to
judgments on loans or forbearance of money but should apply to all money
judgments, We strongly disagree and hold that the "judgments"
contemplated in the said Circular are judgments involving such loans or
forbearances only and not in judgments in litigations that have nothing to do
with loans as in the case at bar.</p>
