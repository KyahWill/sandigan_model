				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On July 1, 1988, at around half past seven in the evening, four
armed men entered the house of Juan Siobal in Barangay Salcedo, San Manuel,
Tarlac, and forcibly took him and his son Jovito outside, where they were shot
in cold blood.  Two of the men had
covered their faces while the other two had not.  More than four months later, these latter two were identified as
Angel Fabros and Danilo Fernando and were subsequently prosecuted for double
murder.  After trial, they were found
guilty as charged and sentenced to <u>reclusion</u> <u>p</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">erpe</span>tua</u> and to pay solidarily
civil indemnity in the amount of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">60,
000.00, </span>the funeral expenses in the sum of P14,000.00, and the costs of
the suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused-appellants are now before this Court to replead their innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The star witness for the prosecution was Anita Siobal Fernandez,
Juan's daughter.  She testified that on
that tragic night, four men knocked at their door and introduced themselves as
Constabulary soldiers.  They were not in
uniform but were all armed.  Each of the
two accused carried a .38 caliber revolver while the masked men were carrying
carbines.  One of the men closed the
doors and windows.  The rest of the
family was herded into a room while her father and her brother Jovito were tied
and dragged out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the house
into the MacArthur Highway.  Minutes
later, they heard five shots.  As they
feared, these shots had killed Juan and Jovito, whose lifeless bodies were
found sprawled along the road.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anita's testimony was corroborated by her mother, Martina Castro
Siobal.  Like Anita, she explained that
she had not spoken out earlier to denounce the accused because she was afraid,
and it was only later, after she had composed herself and thought things over,
that she decided to talk to the police.  She said she had withheld her identification of the accused because of
her fear of the threats she heard every night following the murders.  The voices said that she herself would be
killed if she exposed her husband’s and son's assailants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both Fabros and Fernando denied participation in the offenses,
claiming they were somewhere else at the time the Siobals were killed.  Fabros sought to show that he was then
working at the Asian Engine Rebuilders, where he was employed as a machinist.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Fernando testified that from 9 o'clock in the morning of July 1 until about the
same hour the next morning of July 2, 1988, he was playing mahjong in the house
of Zenaida Delfin.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fabros was corroborated by Marian Soriano, payroll clerk of the
said company, who presented the daily time record<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
of the former showing that on July 1, 1988, he punched out at 8:02 p.m. and the
payroll record showing that he worked overtime for three hours that night.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Two other employees, Rufino Yee and Jael Honesto, declared under oath that
Fabros worked until eight o'clock that evening of July 1, 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fernando was corroborated by Zenaida Delfin and Basilio Delfin,
who both testified that they were playing mahjong with him on the night in
question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants’ brief seeks to cast doubt on the prosecution
evidence and wonders why it took Anita and Martina more than four months to
point to the accused-appellants as the killers.  It also faults the trial court for rejecting their defense of
alibi notwithstanding their clear showing that they were not at the scene of
the crime when the victims were killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have said often enough that the factual findings of the trial
judge are conclusive even on this Court as long as they are supported by
substantial evidence.  The reason is
that he is in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses,
whom he can directly observe on the stand, and to ascertain by their demeanor
whether they are telling the truth or spinning <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">a </span>tissue of lies.  The
telltale marks of deception are directly detectable by the trial judge but not
discernible on appeal from the sterile record.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have also said, no less frequently, that inconsistencies among
witnesses testifying on the same incident may be expected because different
persons may have different impressions or recollections of the same
incident.  One may remember a detail
more clearly than another.  Witnesses
may have seen that same detail from different angles or viewpoints.  That same detail may be minimized by one but
considered important by another.  Nevertheless, these disparities do not necessarily taint the witnesses’
credibility as long as their separate versions are substantially similar or
agree on the material points.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, although it may be conceded that there are some variations
in the separate testimonies of Anita and Martina, these do not, in our view,
detract from the integrity of their declarations.  On the contrary, they represent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>believable narration, made more so precisely because of their
imperfections, of what actually happened on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">night </span>of July 1, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The delay in the identification of the accused-appellants is
attributable to the two women's apprehension that the accused-appellants might
turn on them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as </span>the threats they
heard in the night had intoned.  The
witnesses were not stout-hearted men but timid women whose kin had been
murdered in cold blood.  One would hope
that they had come out earlier, to make their charge more credible, but the fact
is that they did not because they were afraid.  It was a natural reluctance.  Fear inhibits and silences.  At
any rate, it has been remarked, and correctly, that different persons may have
dissimilar reactions to the same incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that Anita and Martina were afraid when they could have been fearless
does not mean that they are not telling the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the alibis of both accused?appellants have
been corroborated.  As we have said,
however, the findings of the trial court regarding the credibility of the
defense witnesses deserve respect from this Court, for reasons already
given.  We shall not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>reverse His Honor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">if </span>he has chosen to believe Martina
and Anita rather than the friends of Fabros and Fernando who have supported
their respective alibis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The daily time and the payroll records are at best only
persuasive and do not conclusively prove Fabros's presence at the shop on the
night the Siobals were killed.  The
Bundy clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>not the most
reliable timekeeper.  Punching in or out
for somebody else is a common problem in many establishments, including
government offices.  As for Fernando, it
has been established that the Siobal house is only 750 meters away from the
place where he was supposedly playing mahjong and so was within his convenient
reach for the commission of the crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that the men who entered the Siobal house that
night were bent on one and only one thing:  murder.  Not a single article was
taken.  None of the women was
molested.  All the intruders were motivated
by only one purpose, and that was to take out Juan and Jovito Siobal and to
kill them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>planned.  Thus, upon entering the house, they closed
the door and windows.  They forced the
rest of the family, unharmed, into <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>room.  Then they dragged out the father and the son
and killed them.  They knew what to do
and they did it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given these circumstances, the Court can only connect the killing
to an earlier one, where the victim was Dominador Fernando, Danilo's brother
and Fabros's nephew.  The suspected
killer was Carlito Siobal, Juan's son and Jovito's brother.  It is evident that the motive for the
killing was vengeance for the slain Dominador.  That motive can be imputed to the accused-appellants, whose kin had been
killed, as they believed, by Carlito's kin, who must therefore be punished for
his sin.</p>

<p class="BODY">  The factual conclusions
of the trial judge must stand, there being no clear showing that they were
reached arbitrarily or in disregard of the evidence of record.  We agree that the accused-appellants acted
in concert in pursuing their evil purpose and so are liable under their
conspiracy to the same and equal penalty.  We also find that the killings were attended by treachery and evident
premeditation as above discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where treachery has already been used to qualify the crime as
murder, evident premeditation should be considered only as a generic
aggravating circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
And as there is no other modifying circumstance, the penalty properly imposable
is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, in view of the prohibition of the death
penalty by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that the appellants were charged with double
murder in one single information.  This
was violative of Section 13, Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure, which
provides that “a complaint or information must charge but one offense except
only in those cases in which existing laws prescribe a single punishment for
various offenses.”</p>

<p class="BODY">But as this section was not invoked at the trial, the defect
cannot be belatedly questioned on appeal.  The consequence of such omis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">s</span>ion
is that the accused-appellants may be convicted of as many offenses as are
charged in the said defective <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">information.</span><span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>ruling
that “in essence, a complex crime was charged which carries only a single
penalty.” Under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code, a complex crime exists
“when a single act constitutes two or more grave or less grave felonies, or
when an offense is a­ necessary means for committing the other.” We have held
that where the killing are not shown <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to
have been committed by </span>a single discharge of firearms, the crime cannot
be complexed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the evidence shows that the victims were killed separately
with five gunshots.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two other men who covered their faces with handkerchiefs have
not been apprehended and remain unpunished.  Why the accused-appellants did not choose a similar precaution is a
question the Court does not have to answer, short of saying that their
recklessness is not proof of their innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the lower court is hereby
MODIFIED.  The accused-appellants are
found guilty of two murders and sentenced for each murder to the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u> and to pay jointly and severally to the heirs of the victims
the sum of P100<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">,000.00, in</span> accordance
with<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the existing policy of the
Court.  Conformably to Article 70 of the
Revised Penal Code, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">duration of the
two penalties of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> shall not exceed 40
years.  The appeal is DISMISSED, with
costs against the accused-appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
