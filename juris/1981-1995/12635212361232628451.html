In Our Resolution promulgated December 14, 1979 in the first 
above-entitled case, respondent Stanley R. Cabrera, a successful Bar 
examinee in 1977 against whom petition had been filed for denial of his 
admission as member of the Bar for lack of good moral character and for 
his proclivity to filing baseless, malicious, and unfounded cases, was 
found guilty of contempt of this Court for "(b)y his improper conduct in
 the use of highly disrespectful, insolent language, respondent has 
tended to degrade the administration of justice; he has disparaged the 
dignity and brought to disrepute the integrity and authority of the 
Court” and was sentenced to pay within ten days from notice a fine of 
P500.00 or imprisonment of 50 days.  (See 94 SCRA 512.)
<p>
Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated January 9, 1980 
which We denied on March 6, 1980 and further required respondent to pay 
within five (5) days from notice the aforesaid fine of P500.00.
</p><p>
The fine was thereafter paid on March 14, 1980 under SC Official Receipt
 No. 5369050X.  On July 16, 1980, respondent submitted an Urgent Motion 
for Admission to the Bar "in view of the foregoing (payment) and for 
mercy" which We denied on August 12, 1980 since the investigation 
against the said respondent was still pending before the Legal 
Investigator of the Court, Atty. Victor J. Sevilla.
</p><p>
Another Urgent Motion for Early Resolution dated August 9, 1980 was 
again filed with the Court by respondent, calling attention to the fact 
that the case has been pending since April, 1977.  We noted said motion 
on September 16, 1980.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, respondent manifested to the Court in still another Urgent 
Motion for Admission to the Bar dated September 25, 1981 that 
"respondent has amended his ways and has conformed to the use of polite,
 courteous, and civil language as can be gleaned from (his) urgent 
motion for admission to the Bar dated July 16, 1980 and (his) urgent 
motion for early resolution dated August 29, 1980 filed with this 
Honorable Court; and that undersigned respondent reiterates his sincere 
apologies to this Honorable Court and its Legal Investigator for all his
 actuations since this case was filed in 1977; x x x that undersigned 
respondent was acquitted by Judge Priscila Mijares of the City Court of 
Manila for estafa wherein Lourdes C. Perea was the complaining witness 
as hereto authenticated by Annexes A, A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, A-6 and 
made an integral part of this motion." Respondent prayed that "for 
humanitarian considerations, considering that undersigned respondent has
 seven children, a wife, and a widowed mother to support," he be allowed
 to take his oath of office as a lawyer and be admitted to the Bar.
</p><p>
Respondent then wrote a letter dated August 25, 1982 to the Chief 
Justice, reiterating his sincere apologies to the Court for all his 
actions which culminated in his conviction for contempt and prayed for 
help to enable him "to uplift the living conditions of (his) seven 
children considering that up to this date (he is) a squatter beside the 
railroad tracks living in abject poverty." The aforementioned letter was
 noted by this Court on September 16, 1982.
</p><p>
In the meantime, the second case, "SBC-571 (Lourdes C. Perea vs. Stanley
 R. Cabrera)" was ordered archived in view of the resolutions in the 
first case "SBC-585 (Emilia E. Andres vs. Stanley R. Cabrera)" denying, 
among others, respondent's admission to the Bar, as per Our Resolution 
dated September 13, 1979 in SBC-571.
</p><p>
On February 21, 1983, respondent wrote a second letter to the Chief 
Justice, once more reiterating his sincere apologies to the Court and 
begged for mercy "to the end that he be allowed to take his oath of 
office as a lawyer and enable him to give his children a bright future.”
 In Our Resolution of June 14, 1983, We resolved to deny the aforesaid 
letter/petition.
</p><p>
On July 5, 1983, there was received in this Court a letter from one 
Nerida V. Cabrera with address at 732 Int. 4, Bagumbayan, Bacood, Sta. 
Mesa, M.M., wife of the respondent herein, addressed to the Chief 
Justice, appealing for kindness and humanitarian consideration to allow 
her husband to take his oath as a lawyer so that he can provide food and
 shelter for their eight children because he is unemployed.  She also 
apologized for her husband for his disrespectful language to the Court 
and prayed that she be allowed to apologize personally to the Chief 
Justice and to the Supreme Court for her husband.
</p><p>
We noted the said letter of Nerida V. Cabrera and required said 
respondent to appear personally before this Court on Tuesday, August 23,
 1983 at 11:00 o'clock a.m.  The records further disclose that a 
handwritten letter by Nerida Cabrera dated August 1, 1983 attaching a 
picture of the family of respondent and their eight children and a 
similar handwritten letter by Presentacion Vda. de Cabrera, mother of 
the respondent, were sent to the Chief Justice.  Notices of the hearing 
set for August 23, 1983 were given to the parties.
</p><p>
At the said hearing, Atty. Rhodora Javier appeared and argued for the 
complainant Emilia E. Andres in SBC-585 (Emilia E. Andres vs. Stanley R.
 Cabrera).  Stanley Cabrera appeared in his own behalf and answered the 
questions asked by the Court.  Atty. Victor Sevilla, Legal Investigator 
of this Court, who investigated SBC-585, also answered the questions 
asked by the Court.  The Court then resolved to require respondent 
Cabrera to submit within five (5) days from date (1) letters of apology 
to the Court, to Atty. Victor Sevilla, to complainant Emilia E. Andres, 
and to Fiscal Leonardo Arguelles for the contumacious and vile language 
contained in his pleadings, and (2) certifications of good behavior and 
exemplary conduct from the Parish Priest and from the Barangay Captain 
of the place where he resides.  Thereafter, the petition to take the 
lawyer's oath shall be considered submitted for resolution.
</p><p>
On August 25, 1983, respondent forwarded to the Chief Justice his letter
 of apology and through him to all the Associate Justices of the Court 
"for all (his) disrespectful acts and utterances thru (his) pleadings 
against the Honorable Supreme Court" and promised never to commit the 
same.  He enclosed therewith the Letter of Apology to Atty. Victor 
Sevilla, Legal Investigator of the Court, Letter of Apology to Atty. 
Emilia E. Andres, Legal Division, MOLE, complainant in SBC-585, Letter 
of Apology to Fiscal Leonardo Arguelles, Manila City Hall, Certification
 of Good Moral Character from Rev. Fr. Eduardo A. Cruz, Parish Priest, 
Our Lady of Fatima Parish, Fatima Village, Bacood, Lubiran St., Sta. 
Mesa, Manila, and Certification of Good Moral Character from Barangay 
Captain Emiliano C. Masilungan of Barangay 604, Zone 60, Sta. Mesa, 
Manila.
</p><p>
The authority and responsibility over the admission, suspension, 
disbarment and reinstatement of attorneys-at-law is vested in the 
Supreme Court by the Constitution.  (Art. X, Sec. 5(5).  This power is 
indisputably a judicial function and responsibility.  It is judicial in 
the sense that discretion is used in its exercise.  The function 
requires (1) previously established rules and principles, (2) concrete 
facts, whether past or present, affecting determinate individuals, and 
(3) decision as to whether these facts are governed by the rules and 
principles; in effect, a judicial function of the highest degree.  (In 
re:  Cunanan, et al., 94 Phil. 534).
</p><p>
This power to admit attorneys to the Bar is not, however, an arbitrary 
and despotic one, to be exercised at the pleasure of the court, or from 
passion, prejudice or personal hostility, but it is the duty of the 
court to exercise and regulate it by a sound and judicial discretion.  
(In re:  Crum, 204 Pac. 948; 103 Ore. 297; 1 Thornton on 
Attorneys-at-Law, Sec. 2, cited in Moran, Comments on the Rules of 
Court, Vol. 6, pp. 204, 205).
</p><p>
On the other hand, the power to punish persons for contempt is inherent 
in all courts and essential to the preservation of order in judicial 
proceedings and to the enforcement of their lawful orders and decisions 
(Montalban vs. Canonoy, 38 SCRA 1).  A lawyer who uses intemperate, 
abusive, abrasive or threatening language betrays disrespect to the 
court, disgraces the Bar and invites the exercise by the court of its 
disciplinary power.  (Surigao Mineral Reservation Board vs. Cloribel, 
L-27072, Jan. 9, 1970, 31 SCRA 1; In re Almacen, 31 SCRA 562; Montecillo
 vs. Gica, 60 SCRA 234).  Such power, however, should be exercised on 
the preservative and not on the vindictive principle and on the 
corrective and not on the retaliatory idea of punishment.  (Weigal vs. 
Shuster, 11 Phil. 340; Villavicencio vs. Lucban, 39 Phil. 778; People 
vs. Marcos, 70 Phil. 468, 480; Victorino vs. Espiritu, 5 SCRA 653; 
Reliance Procoma, Inc. vs. Phil-Asia Tobacco Corp., 57 SCRA 370; 
Fontelera vs. Amores, 70 SCRA 37).  Furthermore, contempt power should 
not be utilized for mere satisfaction of natural inclination to strike 
back at a party who has shown lesser respect to the dignity of the 
court.  (Royeca vs. Animas, 71 SCRA 1).
</p><p>
In the case at bar, respondent having paid the fine imposed upon him for
 direct contempt against the integrity and dignity of this Court, having
 apologized in repeated motions filed before this Court for his 
disrespectful language and personally reiterated at the hearing 
conducted herein, and has furthermore complied with the Court's 
directives contained in Our Resolution dated August 23, 1983 by 
submitting his letters of apology to the Chief Justice and to the 
members of this Court, to Atty. Victor Sevilla, Legal Investigator of 
the Court, to complainant Atty. Emilia E. Andres, to Fiscal Leonardo 
Arguelles, and Certifications of Good Moral Character from his parish 
priest, Rev. Fr. Eduardo A. Cruz, and his Barangay Captain, Emiliano C. 
Masilungan of Barangay 604, Zone 60, Sta. Mesa, Manila where respondent 
resides, We are convinced by these actions that he has become 
respectful, sincere and honest, thereby evincing that good moral 
character required of a person who may be admitted to the practice of 
law.
</p><p>
The pleas of his mother and wife for the sake and the future of 
respondent's family with eight young children, althou self-serving, are 
strong human factors in considering judiciously and wisely the motion of
 respondent which in effect would allow him to start on a professional 
career as a lawyer that would certainly mean a bright future for himself
 and his family, for otherwise the discretion with which the Court may 
admit qualified personal to the practice of law may be clouded with 
vindictiveness and retaliation which is not the basic purpose of the 
Court's inherent power to punish for contempt.
</p><p>
The dignity and authority of the Court has been maintained and preserved
 when the Court punished respondent for his contumacious conduct and he 
willingly and promptly paid the penalty therefor.  The preservative and 
corrective purpose of the contempt power of this Court has already been 
accomplished and achieved that to continue denying his plea for 
forgiveness and mercy in his behalf and his family is not only to 
prolong the agony of his misconduct which he has suffered for seven long
 years since 1977 when he passed the Bar examinations but also would 
appear to be despotic and arbitrary.  We hold that respondent has 
expiated enough for his misdeed and may now be allowed to take the 
lawyer's oath and thus become a more useful member of society and of the
 law profession.
</p><p>
In SBC-571, since the charge against respondent for estafa which is the 
basis of the petition for disqualification filed by complainant Lourdes 
C. Perea, has been dismissed and respondent acquitted in Criminal Case 
No. 015429-CV by the City Court of Manila, Branch VII, the same is 
hereby dismissed.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, respondent Stanley R. Cabrera is hereby allowed to take the lawyer's oath.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Fernando</em>, C.J., <em>Teehankee, Makasiar, Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Escolin,</em> and <em>Relova</em>, JJ., concur.
</p><p>
Gutierrez, Jr., J., Entertains some reservations about the respondent’s 
ability or willingness to maintain his changed disposition conduct but 
concurs in the decision to give him a chance to be a member of the bar 
in good standing.
