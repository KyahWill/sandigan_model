of respondent Court in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 24779, entitled "Heirs of the Late
Jaime Binuya, et al. versus Honorable Arturo A. Romero, et al." dismissing
their petition for the review of the decision of Branch 120 (Kalookan City) of
the Regional Trial Court (RTC), National Capital Judicial Region, in Civil
Cases Nos. 14662 and 14663 entitled "Jaime Binuya versus Bernardo
Carpio" and Jaime Binuya versus Rustico Dungao", respectively, which
modified the decision of Branch 50 of the Metropolitan Trial Court (MTC) of
Kalookan City in Civil Case No. 19587 and Civil Case No. 19588 for
ejectment.  The RTC modified the said
decision by ordering that the eviction of the defendants therein be effected
only after they shall have been reimbursed or paid by the original plaintiff,
now substituted by petitioners, for the value of their houses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As culled from the
pleadings, the following facts are not disputed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' father, Jaime Binuya, was the registered owner of a
parcel of land located along P. Garcia Street, Kalookan City.  He leased out a portion thereof to private
respondent Dungao who constructed thereon a residential house.  The lease was to run for a period of ten
(10) years, commencing on 1 April 1968; a monthly rental of P20.00 was agreed
upon.  In 1973, private respondent
Carpio bought one of Jaime's two (2) houses on the lot; after the said
purchase, Carpio leased that portion of the lot occupied by the house for a
period of ten (10) years commencing on 22 June 1973 at a monthly rental of
P20.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Both contracts of lease
were in writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contract with Dungao was renewed for a period of two (2)
years after its expiration.  Although no
further renewal or extension was agreed upon, Dungao was allowed to stay in the
premises on a month to month basis at a monthly rental of P40.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There was no extension or
renewal of the contract of lease with Carpio after its expiration, but he,
nevertheless, continued to stay </span><span style="">on
</span><span style="">the premises, paying a monthly
rental of P30.00, which was later increased to P40.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon their failure to pay rentals after March 1989, an amicable
settlement thru the conciliation procedure prescribed under P.D. No. 1508 was
attempted.  This having failed, Jaime
Binuya filed the aforesaid Civil Cases Nos. 19587 and 19588 for ejectment with
Branch 50 of the MTC of Kalookan City against Bernardo Carpio and Rustico Dungao,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Joint-Affidavit submitted to the MTC, private respondent
Carpio claimed that Jaime agreed to reimburse him (Carpio) for the value of the
improvements he would introduce on the house and that the current value of such
improvements is P80,000.00.  On the
other hand, private respondent Dungao claimed that Jaime also agreed to
reimburse him for the value of the improvements he would introduce on the
portion leased should Jaime decide to repossess the land.  Both private respondents further asserted
that their respective contracts of lease were renewed for a period of ten (10)
years per renewal; Carpio was on his second renewal while Dungao was on his <span style="">third </span>renewal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Joint Decision dated 13 October 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> the
Metropolitan Trial Court ruled for Jaime Binuya and ordered the private
respondents as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered,
ordering:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  Both defendants<span style=""> </span>and all persons claiming rights <span style="">under </span>them to remove their respective structures from and to
vacate the subject premises and surrender peacefully the possession of said
premises to the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Both defendants to pay all their respective rentals as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(a) Defendant
Bernardo Carpio to pay the sum of P630.00 representing unpaid rentals at P40.00
per month from April, 1989 up to August, 1990, and furthermore, the sum of
P40.00 per month beginning with the month of September, 1990 and every month
thereafter until said defendant finally vacates the premises;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(b) Defendant
Rustico Dungao to pay the sum of P680.00 representing unpaid rentals at P40.00
per month from April, 1989 up to August, 1990, and furthermore, the sum of
P40.00 per month beginning with the month of September, 1990 and every month
thereafter until said defendant finally vacates the premises;</p>

<blockquote>3.  Both defendants to pay P6,000.00 each as and for reasonable attorney's
fees, plus costs of these suits."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court dismissed the counterclaims of both Carpio and Dungao
for lack of merit.  In respect to their
claims for reimbursements for the value of improvements introduced by them, the
court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x A careful perusal of the lease contract originally
entered into by the parties reveals no such agreement to that effect.  Furthermore, defendants failed to present
any document to show that there was such an agreement entered into between
themselves and plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Herein private respondents appealed from said Decision to the
Regional Trial Court of Kalookan, Branch 120, which docketed their appeals as
Civil Cases Nos. 14662 and 14663.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 February 1991, Jaime Binuya died, prompting the herein
petitioners to substitute him as plaintiff in the<span style=""> </span>appealed cases.  On 4
April 1991, the RTC, per respondent Judge Arturo A. Romero, rendered its
decision in the said cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> the
dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED subject
to the modification that the eviction shall be effected after defendants shall
have been reiumbursed (sic) or paid by plaintiff for the value of their houses
aforementioned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This order requiring plaintiff to reimburse defendants for the
value of the latter's houses is founded on its conclusion that private
respondents are builders in good faith, which in turn is anchored <span style="">on </span>the following findings:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Worth-noting (sic) is
the fact that in Civil Case No. 19587, the plaintiff sold his house then
existing on the lot in question to the defendant at the time lease (sic)
agreement was entered into between plaintiff and defendant Carpio.  And in Civil Case No. 19588, the defendant
Rustico Dungao erected a residential house on the lot in question upon the
lease of plaintiff's lot with the consent of plaintiff.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Accordingly, what easily
looms as the most pervasive and decisive issue for consideration is whether or
not the defendants are entitled to the reimbursement of (sic) their respective
houses existing on the lots from whence (sic) they are now being evicted.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Under the circumstances on
record, the defendants are owners/builders in good faith.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">In the case of Sarmiento
vs. Agana, 129 SCRA 122, it was held that:  'A landowner on which </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">building has been constructed in good faith
by another has the option to buy the building or </span><span style="">sell </span><span style="">his land to the
builder; he cannot refuse to exercise </span>either <span style="">option'.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Since it </span>is <span style="">evident that the plaintiff prefers to take
possession of both lots in question, the plaintiff should therefore pay the
defendants the value of their improvements."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Failing to understand and unable to accept the modification,
petitioners filed with the respondent Court a petition for the review of the
decision.  The said petition was
docketed as C.A.-G.R. SP No. 24779.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 June 1991, respondent Court promulgated the assailed
resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the petition, there being no <i><u>p</u></i><i><u><span style="">rima</span></u></i><i><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u></i> showing that the trial court judge committed
any error of law or of fact which may warrant a reversal or modification of the
decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>  It agreed with the respondent Judge that
private respondents "are builders in good faith" and "since the
original plaintiff as well as his heirs, herein petitioners, prefer to take
possession of the lot in question, reimbursement is only proper."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then filed the instant petition, claiming that
respondent Court and respondent Judge erred in holding that private respondents
are builders in good faith and in applying the case of <i>Sarmiento vs. </i><i><span style="">Agana.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After private respondents filed their Comment<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> in
compliance with the Resolution of 7 August 1991, this Court resolved to give
due course to the petition and require the parties to submit their respective
Memoranda,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which both parties subsequently complied with.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We decide for the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far back as 1907, in <i>Alburo </i><i><span style="">vs. Villanueva,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court already ruled that a lessee
is not entitled to indemnification for improvements as a builder in good faith,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The contention that the defendant is entitled to the benefits
of the provisions of Article 361 of the Civil Code can not be maintained
because the right to indemnification secured in that article is manifestly
intended to apply only to a case where one builds or sows or plants on land in
which he believes himself to have a claim of title and not to lands wherein
one's only interest is that of tenant under a rental contract; otherwise, it
would always be in the power of the tenant to improve his landlord out of his
property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code mentioned therein is<i> </i>the old Civil Code;
Article 361 provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The owner of land on which anything has been built, sown, or
planted, in good faith, shall be entitled to appropriate the thing so built,
sown, or planted, upon paying the compensation mentioned in Articles 453 and
454, or to compel the person who has built or planted to pay him the value of
the land, and the person who sowed thereon to pay the proper rent
therefor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 453 referred to necessary and useful expenditures while
Article 454 referred to expenditures purely for ostentation or mere pleasure.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Articles 361, 453 and 454
of the old Civil Code are now Articles 448 (with amendments), 546 (with
amendments) and 548, respectively, of the new Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This rule was reiterated
many times over in subsequent cases.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">  The
reason therefore is obvious.  As stated
by this Court in <i>Lopez, Inc. vs. Philippine &amp; Eastern Trading Co.</i>:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x</span> This
principle of possessor in good faith naturally cannot apply to a lessee because
as such lessee he knows that he is not the owner of the leased property.  Neither can he deny the ownership or title
of the lessor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Or, as stated in <i>Guitarte vs. Sabaco,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
lessees are "at the outset aware of the ‘precarious nature’ of their
possession."</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that one of the conclusive presumptions in
Section 2, Rule 131 of the Rules of Court is that "[T]he tenant is not
permitted to deny the title of his landlord at the time of the commencement of
the relation of landlord and tenant between them."</p>

<p class="BODY">In contracts of lease, the matter of improvements introduced by
the lessee is specifically governed by Article 1678 of the new Civil Code which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"If the lessee makes, in good faith, useful improvements which
are suitable to the use for which the lease is intended, without altering the
form or substance of the property leased, the lessor upon the termination of
the lease shall pay the lessee one-half of the value of the improvements at
that time.  Should the lessor refuse to
reimburse said amount, the lessee may remove the improvements, even though the
principal thing may suffer damage thereby.  He shall not, however, cause any more impairment upon the property
leased than is necessary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With regard to ornamental expenses, the lessee shall not be
entitled to any reimbursement, but he may remove the ornamental objects,
provided no damage is caused to the principal thing, and the lessor does not
choose to retain them by paying their value at the time the lease is
extinguished."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the old Civil Code, the matter was governed by Article 1573 in
relation to Article 487.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>  Article 1573 provided:</p>

<blockquote>"A lessee shall have, with respect to useful and voluntary
improvements, the same rights which are granted to usufructuaries."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">while Article 487 provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The usufructuary may make on the property held in usufruct
any improvements, useful or recreative, which he may deem proper, provided he does
not change its form or substance; but he shall have no right to be indemnified
therefor.  He may, however, remove such
improvements, should it be possible to do so without injury to the
property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted at once that the old Civil Code allowed neither
indemnity nor retention.  The new Code,
however, allows indemnity, to the extent of one-half (½) of the value of the<span style=""> </span>useful improvements, if the lessor
chooses to retain them.  In short, it is
the lessor who has the option to pay for one-half (½) the value of the
improvements.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lessee does not have the right to demand that he be paid
therefor.  For if the lessor refuses
"to reimburse said amount", the only remedy available to the lessee
is to "remove the improvements, even though the principal thing may suffer
damage thereby," provided, however, that he should not "cause any
more impairment upon the property leased than is necessary".  Also, not being a possessor in good faith,
and therefore, not entitled to the benefits of Article 546 of the new Civil
Code, the lessee does not have the right of retention over his improvements
until he is reimbursed one-half (½) of the value of the useful improvements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above provisions of law are clear and unambiguous.  The jurisprudence built upon them is
well-entrenched.  Both the respondent
Judge and the respondent Court should not have overlooked or disregarded them;
vigilance on their part would have aborted in due time the probability of the
cases being brought to this Court to contribute to the clogging of its docket.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioner that <i>Sarmiento vs. Agana</i><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
does not apply in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, it was established that as far as private
respondents, the spouses Ernesto Valentino and Rebecca Lorenzo, knew, "the
LAND was owned by ERNESTO'S mother-in-law who, having stated they could build
on the property, could reasonably be expected to later on give them the
LAND." Ernesto constructed the house in 1967.  It turned out, however, that the land was registered in the name
of <span style="">Mr. </span>and Mrs. Jose Santos,
Jr., who sold the same in 1974 to petitioner Sarmiento who in turn filed an
ejectment suit against private respondents.  This Court, taking into account the peculiar circumstances under which they
constructed the house, considered them builders in good faith and, therefore,
affirmed the modifying decision of the Court of First Instance which applied
Article 448 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, therefore, the modification made by respondent Judge
directing that the ejectment of the private respondents shall be effected only
after they shall have been reimbursed or paid by petitioners for the value of
their houses finds no basis in law and disregards the overwhelming weight of
authority on the matter.  He thus
committed a palpable abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style=""> </span>affirming the same by
dismissing the petition in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 24779, the respondent Court
perpetuated the error of the respondent Judge and must, therefore, share the
responsibility for the blunder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is <span style="">hereby </span>rendered GRANTING <span style="">the
</span>instant petition, SETTING ASIDE the resolution of respondent Court of 6
June 1991 in C.A.-G.R. SP No. 24779, SETTING ASIDE <span style="">the </span>modification in the Decision of respondent Judge of 4 April
