				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks the reversal <span style="">of </span>the decision of respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. Sp.
No. 15790 dismissing the petition for review and affirming the decision of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 44 in Civil Case No. 86-38296 which in
turn<span style=""> </span>affirmed the decision of the
Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 27 in Civil Case No. 113298.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Vergel G. Cruz, the private respondent in this case was the <u>bonafide</u>
tenant of Amado Q. Bugayon, Jr. for almost five years in the premises in
question just before this controversy started.  He religiously paid the monthly rentals of P1,400.00, introduced several
improvements and operated a veterinary clinic known as<span style=""> </span>Malate Veterinary Clinic.  Sometime in the latter part of July, 1985, he offered for <span style="">sale </span>the goodwill of the veterinary
clinic and some of its equipments <span style="">to </span>Dr.
Wendelyn V. Yap, Evelia H. Badiagan, Teresita A. <span style="">Baladad and Florencia C. de Vera, the petitioners</span><span style=""> </span>herein.  During the period of negotiations, private respondent Cruz
introduced to the landlord Dr. Wendelyn V. Yap as the person interested in
taking over the clinic.  However, the
negotiations did not materialize<span style=""> </span>but
the petitioners managed to enter into a contract of lease for the said premises
at a monthly rental of <span style="">P1,800.00 </span>with
the landlord.  As a result, private
respondent Cruz brought an action for "Forcible Entry with Damages"
with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 27 against petitioners
herein and the landlord.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 26, 1986, the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch
27, rendered its decision in favor of private respondent <span style="">Cruz, </span>the dispositive portion of which
states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the
plaintiff and all the defendants are ordered to vacate the premises in question
and surrender peaceful possession of the premises to plaintiff; defendants
Amado Bugayon, Jr. and Dr. Wendelyn Yap only are ordered to pay jointly and
severally the plaintiff the amount of P3,000.00 as moral damages; the amount of
P2,000.00 as exemplary damages and the sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's
fees." (Rollo, p. 22-A)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 11, 1988, the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 44
affirmed the aforesaid decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court and on April
21, 1989, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for review of petitioners
and affirmed the decision of the Regional<span style="">
</span>Trial Court, Branch 44.  Hence,
this petition was filed raising the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"2.1.  The Hon. Court
of Appeals erred in ruling that the lower courts were correct in their decision
that the petitioners must vacate the premises and turn over the possession
thereof to the private respondent despite the fact that the private respondent
had already failed and refused to pay for the rentals thereof, thus, did not
have any right thereto, and the petitioners had a valid lease agreement thereof
with the owner of the premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.2.  The Hon. Court
of Appeals erred in ruling that the owner of the premises must be<span style=""> </span>forced to re-lease the premises to
the private respondent even if there is already a<span style=""> </span>valid and existing contract with the petitioners and the refusal
of the owner to lease the same to the private respondent due to the latter's
failure to pay the rentals therefor;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.3.  The Hon. Court of
Appeals erred in ruling that the possession by the petitioners of the premises
located at 1118 Pres. Quirino Avenue was dependent upon the sale of the
goodwill of the Malate Veterinary Clinic by the private respondent to the
petitioners.” (pp. 74-75, <u>Rollo</u>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the petitioners gained access to the
leased premises in question by virtue of the offer of the private respondent to
sell the goodwill over his veterinary clinic to them.  By one reason or another, i.e., the alleged increase in the
asking price for the goodwill from P12,000.00 to P15,000.00 and the alleged
failure of private respondent to secure the necessary permits and licenses from
the government authorities, the negotiations<span style=""> </span>bagged down.  What then
happens to the leasehold rights of private respondent over the premises in
question which he had already transferred to petitioners?  Private respondent claims that in view of
the failure of negotiations, the petitioners should have returned the leased
premises to him but instead of so doing, they entered into <span style="">a </span>lease contract with the landlord
thereby ousting him therefrom through strategy or stealth.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the bone of contention of petitioners is that
the lease between private respondent and the landlord was automatically
terminated because while the negotiations for the sale of the goodwill was
still on-going, the private respondent stopped paying the rentals for the
leased premises which was already on a month-to-month basis as the formal lease
had long expired.  They claim that they
were informed of the same and given the option by the landlord to either vacate
the premises or enter into a new lease agreement with him and to pay an
increased rental of P1,800.00 for the premises beginning the month of August,
1985.  As such, their possession of the
premises has absolutely nothing to do with the proposed sale of the goodwill by
private respondent.  Thus, they claim
that the decision of the lower courts is contrary to law inasmuch as it had
equated the sale of the goodwill with the possession of the premises occupied
by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Correctly, the petitioners claim a right to the premises in
question apart from the proposed sale of the goodwill.  Precisely, private respondent's action for
forcible entry and damages recognizes such fact because he predicates his cause
of action on the<span style=""> </span>deprivation of
his possession by virtue of the new lease contract executed by the petitioners
with the landlord.  Whether this
contract is valid is the <span style="">question </span>to
be resolved here.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule in favor of private respondent.  When the petitioners and the landlord executed a new contract of
lease, the lease of private respondent was still valid and subsisting.  There is no question that private respondent
has not effectively relinquished his leasehold rights over the premises in
question in view of the failure of negotiations for the sale of the
goodwill.  Clearly, the transfer of the
leasehold rights is conditional in nature and has no force and effect if the
condition is not complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the lease of private respondent is on a month-to-month
basis and may be terminated at the end of any month after proper notice or
demand to vacate has been given (Rivera v. Florendo, G.R. No. 60066, July 31,
1986, 143 SCRA 278; Zablan v. CA, G.R. No. 57844, September 30, 1987, 154 SCRA
487; Uy Hoo and Sons Realty Development Corp. v. CA, G.R. No. 83263, June 14,
1989, 174 SCRA 100; Palanca v. IAC, G.R. No. 71566, December 15, 1989, <span style="">180 SCRA </span>119). In the case at bar,
however, the lack of proper notice or demand to vacate upon the private
respondent is clearly evident.  In the
absence of such notice, the lease of private respondent continues to be in
force and can not be deemed to have expired as of the end of the month
automatically.  Neither can the
non-payment of the rent for the month of August, <span style="">1985 </span>be a ground for termination of the lease without a demand to
pay and to vacate.  The instant case can
easily be differentiated from the case of Vda. de Kraut v. Lontok, G.R. No.
L-18374, February 27, 1963, 7 SCRA 281, which was cited by petitioners in
support of their contention that a lease on a month-to-month basis may be
terminated at the end of any month and shall be deemed terminated upon the
lessee's refusal to pay the increased rental because here there was neither
demand on the part of the landlord to pay the rental nor refusal on the part of
the private respondent to pay the same as in fact he made a tender o<span style="">f </span>his rental payment in the latter
part of August, 1985.  Thus, when the
landlord and the petitioners entered into a new contract of lease effectively
depriving the private respondent of his lease, they were clearly guilty of
forcible entry in view of the subsisting lease of private respondent.</p>
