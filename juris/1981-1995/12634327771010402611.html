				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the three (3) consolidated Petitions before us, the common
question raised by petitioners is the constitutionality of Section 11 (b) of
Republic Act No. 6646.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in these cases consist of representatives of the mass
media which are prevented from selling or donating space and time for political
advertisements; two (2) individuals who are candidates for office (one for
national and the other for provincial office) in the coming May 1992 elections;
and taxpayers and voters who claim that their right to be informed of election
issues and of credentials of the candidates is being curtailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is principally argued by petitioners that <span style="">Section 11 </span>(b)
of Republic Act No. 6646 invades and violates the constitutional guarantees
comprising freedom of <span style="">expression.  Petitioners </span>maintain
that the prohibition imposed by <span style="">Section </span>11 (b) amounts to censorship, because
it selects and <span style="">singles </span>out for suppression and repression with criminal
sanctions, only publications of a particular content, namely, media-based
election or political propaganda during the election period of 1992.  It is asserted that the <span style="">prohibition is in </span>derogation
of media's role, function and duty to provide adequate channels of public
information and public opinion relevant to election issues.  Further, petitioners contend that Section 11
(b) abridges the freedom of speech of candidates, and that the suppression of
media-based campaign or political propaganda except those <span style="">appearing in </span>the
Comelec space of the newspapers and on Comelec time of radio and television
broadcasts, would bring about a substantial reduction in the quantity or volume
of information concerning candidates and issues in the election thereby
curtailing and limiting the right of voters to information and opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statutory text that petitioners ask us to strike down as
unconstitutional is that of Section 11 (b) of Republic Act No. 6646, known as
the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 11.  <u>Prohibited
Forms of Election Propaganda</u>. - In addition to the forms of election
propaganda prohibited under Section 85 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, <u>it shall
be unlawful</u>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for </span>any
<u>newspapers, radio broadcasting or television station, other mass media</u>, <span style="">or </span>any person making use of the mass
media <u>to sell or to </u><u><span style="">give </span>free of charge print space or </u><u><span style="">air </span>time for campaign </u><u><span style="">or </span>other political purposes except to
the Commission as provided under Section 90 and 92 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881</u>.  Any mass media columnist, commentator,
announcer or personality who is a candidate for any elective public office
shall take a leave of absence from his work as such during <span style="">the campaign </span>period."
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 11 (b) of Republic Act No. 6646 should
be taken together with Sections 90 and 92 of B.P. Blg. 881, known as the
Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines, which provide respectively as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 90.  <u>Comelec
space</u>. ? The Commission <u>shall procure space</u> in at least one
newspaper of general circulation in every province or city:  <u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>.  That in the absence of <span style="">said </span>newspaper, publication shall be
done in any other magazine or <span style="">periodical
</span>in said province or city, which shall be known as 'Comelec Space'
wherein candidates can announce their candidacy.  Said space sha<span style="">ll</span>
be <u>allocated</u>,<u> free of charge, equally</u>, and <u>impartially</u> by
the Commission <u>among all candidates</u> within the area in which the
newspaper is circulated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 92.  <u>Comelec time</u>.
? The Commission <u>shall procure radio and television time</u> to be
known as 'Comelec Time' which shall be <u>allocated</u> <u>equally</u> and <u>impartially</u>
among the candidates within the area of coverage of all radio and television
stations.  <span style="">For </span>this purpose, the franchises of all radio broadcasting and
television stations are hereby amended so as to provide radio or television <span style="">time, </span><span style="">free </span>of charge, <span style="">during
the </span>period of the campaign." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The objective which animates Section 11
(b) is the <span style="">equalizing, </span>as far as
practicable, the situations of rich and poor candidates by preventing the
former from <span style="">enjoying </span>the undue
advantage offered by huge campaign "war chests." Section 11 (b)
prohibits the sale or donation of print space and air time "for campaign
or other political purposes" except to the Commission on Elections
("Comelec").  Upon the other
hand, Sections 90 and 92 of the Omnibus Election Code require the Comelec to
procure "Comelec space" in newspapers of general circulation in every
province or city and "Comelec time" on radio and television
stations.  Further, the Comelec is
statutorily commanded to allocate "Comelec space" and "Comelec
time" on <span style="">a
</span>free of charge equal and impartial basis among all candidates within the
area served by the <span style="">newspaper or </span>radio
and television station involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">No one seriously disputes the legitimacy or the importance of the
objective sought to be secured by Section 11 (b) (of Republic Act No. 6646) in
relation to Sections 90 and 92 (of the Omnibus Election Code).  That objective is of special importance and
urgency in a country which, like ours, is characterized by extreme disparity in
income distribution between the economic elite and the rest of society, and by
the prevalence of poverty, with the bulk of our population falling below the "poverty
line." It is supremely important, however, to note that that objective is
not only a concededly legitimate one; it has also been given constitutional
status by the terms of Article IX(C)(4) of the 1987 Constitution which provides
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Sec. 4.   The Commission (on Elections) may, during the
election period, </span><u>supervise or regulate the enjoyment or utilization
of all franchises or permits for the operation of</u> <span style="">transportation and other public utilities, </span><u>media of
communication or information</u>, <span style="">all
grants, special privileges, or concessions granted by the </span><span style="">Government or any </span><span style="">subdivision, agency, or instrumentality
thereof, including any government-owned or controlled corporation or its
subsidiary.  Such </span><u>supervision</u>
<span style="">or </span><u>regulation</u> <span style="">shall </span><u>aim to ensure equal opportunity,
time, and space, and the right to reply</u>, <span style="">including reasonable, equal rates therefor, <u>for public information
campai</u></span><u><span style="">g</span></u><u><span style="">ns and forums among </span>candidates</u> <span style="">in connection with the objective of holding
free, orderl</span><span style="">y</span><span style="">, honest, peaceful, and credible elections."
(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Comelec has thus been expressly
authorized by the Constitution to supervise or regulate the enjoyment or
utilization of the franchises or permits for the operation of media of
communication and information.  The
fundamental purpose of such "supervision or regulation" has been
spelled out in the Constitution as the ensuring of "equal opportunity,
time, and space, and the right to reply," as well <span style="">as </span>uniform and reasonable rates of charges for the use of such
media facilities, in connection with "public information campaigns and
forums among candidates."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It seems a modest proposition that the provision of the Bill of
Rights which enshrines freedom of speech, freedom of expression and freedom of
the press (Article III [4], Constitution) has to be taken in conjunction with
Article IX(C)(4) which may be seen to be a special provision applicable during
a specific limited period -- i.e., "during the election period." It
is difficult to overemphasize the special importance of the rights of freedom
of speech and <span style="">freedom of the press in a
democratic <span style="">polity, in particular </span></span>when
they relate to the purity and <span style="">integrity
</span>of the <span style="">electoral
</span><span style="">process itself, the process by
which the people identify those who shall have governance over them.  Thus, it is frequently said that these
rights are accorded </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">preferred status in
our constitutional hierarchy.  Withal,
the rights of free speech and free press are not unlimited </span>rights for
they are not the only <span style="">important </span>and
relevant <span style="">values even in the most
democratic of polities.  In our own
society, equality of opportunity to proffer oneself for public office, without
regard to the level of financial resources that one may have at one's disposal,
is clearly an important value.  One of
the basic state policies given </span>constitutional rank by Article II,
Section 26 of the Constitution is the egalitarian demand that "the State
shall<span style=""> guarantee <u>equal access to
opportunities for public service</u> and prohibit political dynasties as may be
defined by law."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The technical effect of Article IX(C) (4) of the Constitu­tion
may be seen to be that no presumption of <span style="">invalidity </span>arises in respect of exercises of supervisory <span style="">or </span>regulatory authority on the part of
the Comelec for the purpose of securing equal opportunity among candidates for
political office, although such supervision or regulation may result in <u>some</u>
limitation of the rights of free speech and free <span style="">press.  For supervision or
regulation of the operations of media </span>enterprises <span style="">is scarcely conceivable without such accompanying
limitation.  Thus, the applicable rule
is the general, time-honored one ? that a statute is presumed to be
constitutional and that the party asserting its unconstitutionality must
discharge the burden of clearly and convincingly proving that assertion.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Put in slightly different terms, there appears no present
necessity to fall back upon basic principles relating to the police power of
the State and the requisites for constitutionally valid exercise of that
power.  The essential question is whether
or not the assailed legisla­tive or administrative provisions constitute a
permissible exercise of the power of supervision or regulation of the
operations of communication and information enterprises during an election
period, or whether such act has gone beyond permissible supervision or
regulation of media operations so as to constitute unconstitutional repression
of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  The Court considers that Section 11 (b) has not gone outside the
permissible bounds of supervision or regulation of media operations <span style="">during </span>election periods.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the constitutional
assaying of legislative provisions like Section 11 (b), the character and
extent of the </span>limitations resulting from the particular measure being assayed
upon freedom of speech and freedom <span style="">of
the </span>press are essential considerations.  It is important to note that the restrictive impact upon freedom of
speech and freedom of the <span style="">Press </span>of Section 11 (b) is circumscribed by certain important
limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, Section 11 (b) is limited in <span style="">the </span>duration of its applicability and enforceability.  By virtue of the operation of Article
IX(C)(4) of the Constitution, Section 11 (b) is limited in its applicability in
time to election periods.  By its
Resolution No.  2328 dated 2 January
1992, the Comelec, acting under another specific grant of authority by the
Constitution (Article IX(C)(9)), has <span style="">defined
the period from 12 January 1992 until 10 June 1992 as the relevant election
period.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, and more importantly, Section 11 (b) is limited in its
scope of application.  Analysis of
Section 11 (b) shows that it purports to apply only to the purchase and sale,
including purchase and sale disguised <span style="">as
a </span><span style="">donation,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">of </span>print space <span style="">and air time </span>for "campaign or other political
purposes." Section 11 (b) does <u>not</u> purport <span style="">in </span><span style="">any </span><span style="">way</span> <span style="">to</span><span style=""> </span>restrict the
<span style="">reporting </span>by newspapers or radio
<span style="">or </span><span style="">television stations of news or news-worthy
events relating to candidates, their qualifications, political parties and
programs of government.  Moreover,
Section 11 (b) does <u>not</u> reach commentaries and expressions of belief or
opinion by reporters or broadcasters or editors or commentators or columnists
in respect of candidates, their qualifications, and programs and so forth, so
long at least as such comments, opinions and beliefs are not in fact
advertisements for particular candidates covertly paid for.  In sum, Section 11 (b) is not to be read as
reaching any report or commentary or other coverage that, in responsible media,
is not paid for by candidates for political office.  We read Section 11 (b) as designed to cover only paid political
advertisements of particular candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above limitation in scope of application of Section 11 (b) --
that it does not restrict either the reporting of <span style="">or </span>the expression of belief or opinion or comment upon the
qualifications and programs and activities of any and all candidates for office
-- constitutes the critical distinction which must be made between the instant
case and that of <u>Sanidad v. Commission on Elections</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> In <u>Sanidad</u>,
the Court declared unconstitutional Section 19 of Comelec Resolution No. 2167
which provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 19.  <u>Prohibition
on Columnists, Commentators or Announcers</u> -- During the plebiscite campaign
period, on the day before and on plebiscite day, no mass media columnist,
commentator, announcer or personality shall use his column or radio or
television time to campaign for or against the plebiscite issues."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Resolution No. 2167 had been promulgated
by the Comelec in connection with the plebiscite mandated by R.A. No. 6766 on
the ratification or adoption of the Organic Act for the Cordillera Autonomous
Region.  The Court held that Resolution
No. 2167 constituted a restriction of the freedom of expression of petitioner
Sanidad, <span style="">a </span>newspaper columnist
of the Baguio Midland Courier, "for no justifiable reason." The
Court, through Medialdea, <u><span style="">J</span></u><span style="">., said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
x x </span>[N]either Article IX-C of the Constitution nor Section 11(b), 2nd
par. of R.A. 6646 can be construed to mean that the Comelec has also been
granted the right to supervise and regulate the <span style="">exercise </span><u><span style="">by media practitioners themselves</span></u><span style=""> </span>of their right to expression during plebiscite periods.  <u><span style="">Media
practitioners exercising their freedom of expression during plebiscite periods
are neither the franchise holders nor the candidates.  In fact, there are no candidates involved in the plebiscite</span></u><span style="">.  </span>Therefore
Section 19 of Comelec Resolution No. 2167 has no statutory basis."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring partly in the original and partly supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span>is a third
limitation upon the scope of applica­tion of Section 11 (b).  Section 11 (b) exempts from its prohibition
the purchase by or donation to the Comelec of print space or air time, which
space and time Comelec is then affirmatively required to allocate on a fair and
equal basis, free of charge, among <span style="">the
individual candidates </span>for elective public offices in the province or
city served by the newspaper or radio or television station.  Some of the petitioners are apparently apprehensive
that Comelec might not allocate "Comelec time" or "Comelec
space" on a fair and equal basis <span style="">among
</span>the several candidates.  Should
such apprehensions materialize, candidates who <span style="">are in fact </span>prejudiced by unequal or unfair allocations effected
by Comelec will have ap<span style="">p</span>ro<span style="">p</span>riate judicial remedies <span style="">available, </span>so long at least as this
Court sits.  Until such <span style="">time, </span>however, the Comelec is entitled
to the benefit of the presumption that official duty will be <span style="">or is being regularly </span>carried
out.  It <span style="">seems </span>appropriate here to recall what <span style="">Justice Laurel taught in </span><u><span style="">Angara v. Electoral Commission</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> that
the possibility of abuse is no argument against the concession<span style=""> </span>of the power or authority involved,
for there is no power or authority in human society that is not susceptible of
being abused.  Should it be objected
that the Comelec might refrain from procuring "Comelec time" and
"Comelec space," much the same considerations should be borne in
mind.  As earlier noted, the Comelec is
commanded by statute to buy or "procure" "Comelec time" and
"Comelec space" in mass media, and it must be presumed that Comelec
will carry out that statutory command.  There is no indication, so far <span style="">as
</span>the record here would show, that Comelec would not in fact carry out its
statutory duty in this connection, and if it does fail to do so, once <span style="">again, </span>the candidate or candidates
who feel aggrieved have judicial remedies at their disposal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The points<span style=""> </span>that may
appropriately be underscored are that Section 11 (b) does <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> </span>cut off the flow of media reporting, opinion or commentary
about candidates, their qualifications and platforms and promises.  <span style="">Newspaper,
radio </span><span style="">broadcasting and
television stations remain quite free to carry out their regular and normal
information and communica­tion operations.  Section 11 (b) does <u>not</u> authorize any intervention and much less
control on the part of Comelec in </span>respect of the <u>content</u> of the
normal operations of media, nor in respect of the <u>content</u> of political
advertisements which the individual candidates are quite free to present within
their respective allocated Comelec time and Comelec space:  There is here no "officious functionary
of <span style="">(a) </span>repressive
government" dictating what events or ideas reporters, broadcasters,
editors or commentators may talk or write about or display on TV screens.  There is here <span style="">no </span>censorship, whether disguised or otherwise.  What Section 11 (b), viewed in context, in
fact does is to limit <u>paid partisan political advertisements</u> to <u>fora
other than</u> modern mass media, and to "Comelec time" and
"Comelec space" in <span style="">such </span><span style="">mass media.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 (b) does, of course, limit the right of free speech
and of access to mass media of the candidates themselves.  The limitation, however, bears a clear and reasonable
connection with the constitutional objective set out in Article IX(C)(4) and
Article II (26) of the Constitution.  For it is precisely in the unlimited purchase of print space and radio
and television time that the resources of the financially affluent candidates
are likely to make a crucial difference.  Here lies the core problem of equalization of the situations of the
candidates0 with deep pockets and the candidates with shallow or empty pockets
that Article IX(C)(4) of the Constitution and Section 11 (b) <span style="">seek </span><span style="">to address.  That the statutory mechanism which Section </span>11 (b) brings into
operation is designed and may be expected to bring about or <span style="">promote </span>equal opportunity, and equal
time and space, for political candidates to inform all and sundry about
themselves, cannot be gainsaid.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">My learned brother in the
Court Cruz, <u>J</u>. remonstrates, however, that "(t)he financial
disparity among the </span>candidates is <span style="">a
</span>fact of life that cannot be corrected by legislation except only by the
limitation of their respective expenses to <span style="">a </span>common maximum.  <u>The
flaw in the prohibition under challenge is that while the rich candidate is
barred from buying mass media coverage, it nevertheless </u><u><span style="">allows him to spend of his funds </span></u><u><span style="">on </span></u><u><span style="">other campaign activities also inaccessible to his straitened rival</span></u><span style="">." True enough Section 11 (b) does not,
by itself or in conjunction with Sections 90 and 92 of the Omnibus Election
Code, place </span>political candidates on complete and perfect equality <u>inter
se</u> without regard to their financial affluence or lack thereof.  But a regulatory measure that is less than
perfectly comprehensive or which does not completely obliterate the evil sought
to be remedied, is not for that reason alone constitutionally infirm.  The Constitution does not, <span style="">as </span>it cannot, exact perfection in
governmental regulation.  All it
requires, in accepted doctrine, is that the regulatory measure under challenge
bear a reasonable nexus with the constitutionally sanctioned objective.  That the supervision or regulation of
communication and information media is not, in itself, <span style="">a </span>forbidden modality is made clear by the Constitution itself in
Article IX(C)(4).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is believed that, when so viewed, the <span style="">limiting </span>impact of Section 11 (b) upon the right to free speech
of the candidates themselves may be seen to be not unduly repressive or
unreasonable.  For, once again, there is
nothing in Section 11 (b) to prevent media reporting of <span style="">and </span>commentary on pronouncements, activities, written <span style="">statements of the candidates themselves.  All other <u>fora</u> remain accessible to
candidates, even for political advertisements.  The requisites of fairness and equal oportunity are, after all, designed
to benefit the </span>candidates themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the nature and characteristics of modern mass media,
especially electronic media, cannot be totally disregarded.  Realistically, the only limitation <span style="">upon the </span>free speech <span style="">of </span>candidates imposed is on the right
of candidates to bombard the helpless electorate with paid advertisements
commonly repeated in the <span style="">mass media </span><u>ad</u>
<u>nauseam</u>.  Frequently, such
repetitive political commercials when fed into the electronic media themselves
constitute invasions of the privacy of the general electorate.  It might be supposed that it is easy enough
for <span style="">a </span>person at <span style="">home simply to flick off his radio or
television set.  But it is </span><span style="">rarely that simple.  For </span><span style="">the</span><span style=""> candidates with deep </span>pockets

Because of the financial implications involved, true donations by media
enterprises of print space and air time for political advertisements are not
likely to be substantial in number or in peso volume.  The principal effect of the phrase "or to give free of
charge" is thus to catch purchases and sales disguised <span style="">as </span>donations either given directly by
media enterprises, or indirectly through an intervening purchaser-donor.</p>

In noting the phenomenon of the captive audience, the Supreme Court of the
United States in <u>Columbia Broadcasting System <i>v.</i> Democratic National
Committee</u> <span style="">(412
</span><span style="">US 94, </span><span style="">36 L Ed </span>2d 772 (1973]), said:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;"><span style="">"x x x.  </span>The 'captive'
nature of the broadcast audience was recognized as <span style="">early as </span>1924, when Commerce
Secretary Hoover remarked at the Fourth National Radio Conference that 'the
radio listener does not have the same option that the reader of publications
has -- to ignore advertising in which he is not interested – and he may resent
its invasion of his set.' As the broadcast media became more pervasive in our
society, the problem has become more acute.  In a recent decision upholding the Commission's <span style="">power</span> to promulgate rules regarding cigarette adverti­sing, Judge
Bazelon, writing for a unanimous Court of Appeals, noted some of the effects of
the ubiquitous commercial:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.9in; text-indent: 0in;">'Written messages
are not communicated unless they are read, and reading requires an affirmative
act.  Broadcast messages, in contrast,
are "in the air." In an age of omnipresent radio, there scarcely breathes
a citizen who does not know some part of <span style="">a </span>leading cigarette" jingle by
heart.  Similarly, <u>an ordinary
habitual television watcher can avoid these commercials only by frequently
leaving the room, changing the channel, or doing some other such affirmative
act.  It is difficult to calculate the
subliminal impact of this pervasive </u><u><span style="">propaganda, </span>which may be heard even if not listened to, but it
may reasonably be thought greater than the impact of the written word</u>.'
Banzhaf v FCC, 132 US App DC 11, 32-33, 405 F2d 1082, 1100-1101 (1968), cert denied
396 US 842, 24 L Ed 2d 93, 90 S Ct 50 (1969).</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is no answer to say that because
we tolerate pervasive commercial <span style="">advertisements
we </span>can <span style="">also</span>
live with its political counterparts." (36 L. ed 2d at 798; underscoring
supplied)</p>

makes today, the majority has exalted authority over liberty in another
obeisance to the police state, which we so despised during the days of martial
law.  I cannot share in the excuses of
the Court because I firmly believe that the highest function of authority is to
insure liberty.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sustaining the challenged law, the majority invokes the
legislative goal, about which there can be no cavil.  My<span style=""> </span>quarrel is with
the way the objective is being pursued for I find the method a most
indefensible repression.  It does little
good, I should think, to invoke the regulatory authority of the Commission on
Elections, for that power is not <span style="">a </span>license
to violate the Bill of Rights.  The
respondent, no less than the legislature that enacted Section 11(b), <span style="">is </span>subject to the requirements of the
police power which the <u>ponencia</u> seems to disdain.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that a declaration of constitutionality must be
reached only after the most careful deliberation as the challenged act is
presumed to be valid in deference to the political departments.  But not - and this represents a singular
exception - where the act is claimed to violate individual liberty, most
importantly the freedom of expression.  In such a vital and exceptional case, as in the case now before us, I
respectfully submit that the presumption must be reversed in favor of the
challenge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Milton defined freedom of speech as "the liberty to <span style="">know, </span>to utter, and to argue freely
according to conscience, above <span style="">all </span>liberties."
In this context, the definition is understood to embrace all the other cognate
rights involved in the communication of ideas and falling under the more
comprehensive concept of freedom of expression.  These rights include the equally important freedom of the press,
the right <span style="">of </span>assembly and
petition, the right to information on matters of public concern, the freedom <span style="">of </span>religion insofar as it affects the
right to proselytize and profess one's faith or lack of it, and the right to
form associations <span style="">as an </span>instrument
for the ventilation of views bearing on the public welfare.</p>

<p class="BODY">Wendell Philips offered his own reverence for freedom of
expression when he called it "at once the instrument and the guaranty and
the bright consummate flower of all liberty." Like Milton, he was
according <span style="">it </span>an honored place in
the hierarchy of fundamental liberties recognized in the <span style="">Bill of Rights.  </span>And well they might, for this is truly the most cherished
and vital <span style="">of all </span>individual
liberties in the democratic milieu.  It
is no happenstance that it is this freedom that is first curtailed when the
free society falls under a repressive <span style="">regime,
as </span>demonstrated by the government take-over of the press, radio and
television when martial law was declared in this country on that tragic day of
September 21, 1972.  The reason for this
precaution is that freedom of expression is the sharpest and handiest weapon to
blunt the edge of oppression.  No less
significantly, it may be wielded by every citizen in the land, be he peasant or
poet – and, regrettably, including the demagogue and the dolt - who has the
will and the heart to use it.</p>

<p class="BODY">As an individual particle of sovereignty, to use Justice Laurel's
words, every citizen has <span style="">a </span>right
to offer his opinion and suggestions in the discussion of the problems
confronting the community or the nation.  This is not only a right but a duty.  From the <span style="">mass </span>of various
and disparate ideas proposed, the people can, in their collective wisdom and
after full deliberation, choose what they may consider the best remedies to the
difficulties they face.  These may not
turn out to be the best solutions, <span style="">as we
</span>have learned often enough from past bitter experience.  But the scope alone of the options, let
alone the latitude with which they are considered, can insure a far better
choice than that made by the heedless dictator in the narrow confines of his
mind and the loneliness of his pinnacle of power.</p>

<p class="BODY">The citizen can articulate his views, for whatever they may be
worth, through the many methods by which ideas are communicated from mind to
mind.  Thus, he may speak or write or
sing or dance, for all these are forms of expression protected by the
Constitution.  So is silence, which
"persuades when speaking fails." Symbolism can also signify meanings
without words, like the open hand of friendship or the clenched fist of
defiance or the red flag of belligerence.  The individual can convey his message in a poem or a novel or <span style="">a </span>tract or in <span style="">a </span>public speech or through a moving picture or a stage play.  In such diverse ways may he be heard.  There is of course no guaranty that he will
be heeded, for acceptability will depend on the quality of his thoughts and of
his persona, <span style="">as </span>well as the mood
and motivation of his audience.  But
whatever form he employs, he is entitled to the protection of the Constitution
against any attempt to muzzle his thoughts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is one especially
significant way by which the citizen can express his views, and that is through
the ballot.  </span>By the votes he
casts, he is able to participate in the selection of the persons who shall
serve <span style="">as </span>his representatives in
the various elective offices in the government, from the highest position of
President of the Philippines to that of the lowly member of the Sangguniang
Barangay.  In the exercise of this
right, he is free to choose whoever appeals to his intelligence (or lack of
it), whether it be <span style="">a </span>professional
comedian or <span style="">a </span>pretentious moron
or an unrepentant thief or any other candidate with no known distinction except
the presumptuousness to seek elective office.  Fortunately, there are also other candidates deserving of the support of
the circumspect and thinking citizens who will use their suffrages
conscientiously with only the public interest as their criterion and guide.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for the purpose of properly informing the electorate of the
credentials and platforms of the candidates that they are allowed to campaign
during the election period.  Such
campaign includes their personally visiting the voters in house-to-house
sorties, calling on the telephone for their support, sending them letters of
appeal, distributing self-serving leaflets extolling their virtues, giving away
buttons and stickers and sample ballots and other campaign materials, and
holding caucuses, rallies, parades, public meetings and similar
gatherings.  All these they are allowed
to do in the specified places and at the proper time provided only that they do
not exceed the maximum limit of election expenses prescribed by the Election
Code at the rate of P1.50 for every voter currently registered in the
constituency where they filed their certificate of candidacy.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is curious, however, that such allowable campaign activities
do not include the use of the mass media because of the prohibition in Section
11(b) of Rep. Act. No. 6646.  The
candidate may employ letters or leaflets or billboards or placards or posters
or meetings to reach the electorate, incurring for this purpose a not
inconsiderable amount of his or his supporters' money.  But he may not utilize for the same purpose
periodicals, radio, television or other <span style="">forms
of mass communication, even for free.  Employment of these facilities is allowed only through the respondent
Commission on Elections, which is directed by the Election Code to procure
newspaper space and radio and television time to be distributed among the
thousands of candidates vying throughout the land for the thousands of </span>public
<span style="">off</span>ices <span style="">to be filled in the coming elections.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are some students of the Constitution who believe that
unlike the other liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, the freedom of
speech and of the press is absolute and not subject to any kind of regulation <span style="">whatsoever.  Their reason is the language of Article III, Section 4, of the
Constitution, which provides without qualification:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of speech, of
expression or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble
and petition the government for redress of grievances.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court does not accept this extreme theory for the liberty we
recognize is not liberty untamed but liberty regulated by law.  The concept of absolute rights must be
approached with utmost caution if not rejected outright.  The better policy is to assume that every
right, including even the freedom of expression, must be exercised in
accordance with law and with due regard for the rights of others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In fact, laws punishing
crimes like slander and libel and inciting to sedition have never been
seriously or </span>successfully questioned.  Contemptuous language is not allowed in judicial proceedings.  Obscenity is proscribed, as so are acts that
wound religious sensibilities.  This
Court has regulated the exercise of the right to hold rallies and meetings,
limiting them to certain places and hours and under specified conditions, in
the interest of peace and security, public convenience, and <span style="">it </span>one case, even to prevent
disturbance of the rites in a nearby church.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> Under
the Public Assembly Act, a permit from the mayor shall be necessary for the
holding of <span style="">a </span>public meeting
except where the gathering is to be held in <span style="">a </span>private place or the campus of <span style="">a </span>government-owned or controlled educational institution or <span style="">a </span>freedom park.</p>

<p class="BODY">All <span style="">this is not meant to
suggest that every </span>government regulation is a valid regulation.  On the contrary, any attempt to restrict the
exercise of a right must be tested by the strict requisites of the valid
exercise of the police power <span style="">as </span>established
by this Court in <span style="">a </span>long line of
decisions.  These requisites are:  1) the interests of the public generally as
distinguished from those of a particular class require the exercise of the
police power; and 2) the means employed are reasonably necessary to the
accomplishment of the purpose sought to be <span style="">achieved and not unduly oppressive upon individuals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In simpler terms, the police measure, to be
valid, must have a lawful objective and a lawful method of achieving it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lawful objective of
Section 11(b) may be readily conceded.  The announced purpose of the law is to prevent disparity between the
rich and the poor candidates by denying both of them access to the mass media
and thus preventing the former from enjoying an undue advantage over the
latter.  There is no question that this
is </span>a <span style="">laudable goal.  Equality among </span>the <span style="">candidates in this regard should be
assiduously pursued by the government if the aspirant with limited resources is
to have any chance at all against an opulent opponent who will not hesitate to
use his wealth to make up for his lack of competence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But in constitutional
law, the end does not justify the means.  To pursue a lawful objective, only </span>a <span style="">lawful method may be employed even if it may not be the best among the
suggested options.  In my own view, the
method here applied falls far short of the constitutional criterion.  I believe that the necessary reasonable link
between the means employed and the purpose sought to be achieved has not been
proved and that the method employed is unduly oppressive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The financial disparity among the candidates is a fact of life
that cannot be corrected by legislation except only by the limitation of their
respective expenses to <span style="">a </span>common
maximum.  The <span style="">flaw </span>in the prohibition under challenge is that while the rich
candidate is barred from buying <span style="">mass
media </span>coverage, it nevertheless allows him to <span style="">spend his funds on other campaign activities </span><span style="">also </span>inaccessible to his straitened
rival.  Thus, the rich candidate may
hold as many rallies and meetings as he may desire or can afford, using for the
purpose the funds he would have spent for the prohibited mass media time and
space.  The number of these rallies and
meetings, which also require tremendous expense, cannot be matched by the poor
candidate, but the advantage of the rich candidate in this case is not
similarly prohibited.  By the <span style="">same </span>token, the rich candidate may
visit more houses, send more letters, make more telephone appeals, distribute
more campaign materials, incurring for all these more expenses than the poor
candidate can afford.  But these
advantages are allowed by the law because they do not involve the use of mass
media space and time.</p>

<p class="BODY">And what <span style="">if </span>the
rich candidate pays P25,000 from his own funds to buy media advertising and the
same amount is raised for the same purpose by 250 supporters of the poor
candidate contributing <span style="">P100 </span>each?  Both transactions would be prohibited under
the law although the rich candidate clearly has in this case no advantage over
his adversary.</p>

<p class="BODY">And what if a candidate is endorsed not in a paid advertisement
or commercial but by a columnist or <span style="">a </span>radio
commentator who is apparently expressing his own opinion without financial
consideration or inducement?  This is
not prohibited by Section 11(b) simply because the endorsement does not appear
to have been purchased by the candidate or given to him for free.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proposed distribution of COMELEC time and space is hardly
workable, considering the tremendous number of candidates running all over the
country for the offices of President of the Philippines, Vice-President,
senators, representatives, provincial governors, vice-governors, provincial
board members, city mayors, vice-mayors and councilors, and municipal mayors,
vice-mayors and councilors.  Allocation
of equal time and space among the candidates would involve administrative work
of unmanageable proportions, and the possibility as well of unequal
distribution, whether deliberate or unintentional, that might create more
serious problems than the problem at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed the settled rule that questions regarding the
necessity or wisdom of the law are for the <span style="">legislature to resolve and its resolution may not be </span>reviewed by
the courts of justice.  In the case of
the police power, however, it is required that there be <span style="">a </span>plausible nexus between the method employed and the purpose
sought to be achieved, and determination of this link involves a judicial
inquiry into the reasonableness of the challenged measure.  It is true, <span style="">as </span>remarked by Justice Holmes, that a law has done all it can if
it has done all it should, but this is on the <span style="">assumption </span>that what the law has done was valid to begin
with.  The trouble with the challenged
law is that it has <u><span style="">exceeded</span></u><span style=""> </span>what it should have done, thereby
becoming <span style="">both </span>inefficacious and
arbitrary.  As such, it must be slain.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the most important objection to Section 11(b) is that it
constitutes prior restraint on the dissemination of ideas.  In a word, it is <u><span style="">censorship</span></u><span style="">.  </span>It is that officious functionary of
the repressive government who tells the citizen that he may speak only if
allowed to do so, and no more and <span style="">no </span>less
than what he is permitted to say on pain <span style="">of
</span>punishment should he be so <span style="">rash
as </span>to disobey.  In his
"Appeal for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing," Milton deplored the
impossibility of finding a man base enough to accept the office of censor and
at the same time good enough to perform its duties.  Yet <span style="">a </span>pretender to
that meddler is in our midst today, smugly brandishing the threat of this
miserable law.</p>

<p class="BODY">One could perhaps concede some permissible <span style="">instances </span>of censorship, as where
private mail is screened during wartime to prevent deliberate or unwitting
disclosure of sensitive or classified matters that might prejudice the national
security or where, to take <span style="">a </span>famous
example, a person is prohibited from shouting "Fire!" in a crowded
theater.  But these exceptions merely
make and bolster the rule that there should be no prior restraint upon a
person's right to express his ideas on any subject of public interest.  The rule applies whether the censorship be
in the form of outright prohibition, as in the cases before us, or in more
subtle forms like the imposition of a tax upon periodicals exceeding a
prescribed maximum number of copies per issue<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> or
allowing the circulation of books only if they are judged to be fit for minors,
thus reducing the reading tastes of adults to the level of juvenile morality.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I remind the Court of the doctrine announced in Bantam Books v.
Sullivan<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
that "any system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court
bearing a heavy presumption against its validity." That presumption has
not been refuted in the cases <u>sub</u> <u>j</u><u><span style="">udice</span></u><span style="">.  </span>On the contrary, the challenged
provision appears quite clearly to be invalid on its face because of its
undisguised attempt at censorship.  The
feeble effort to justify it in the name of social justice and clean elections
cannot prevail over the self-evident fact that what we <span style="">have here is an illegal intent to suppress free speech by denying
access to the mass media as the </span>most <span style="">convenient instruments for the molding of public opinion.  And it does not matter that the use of these
facilities may involve financial transactions, </span>for the element of the
commercial does not remove them from the protection of the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>law <span style="">is no less oppressive on the candidates
themselves who want and have the right to address the greatest number of voters
through the modern facilities of the press, radio and television.  Equally injured are the ordinary citizens,
who are </span>also <span style="">entitled to be
informed, through these </span>mass media, <span style="">of the qualifications and platforms of the various candidates aspiring
for public office, that they may be guided </span>in <span style="">the choice they must make when they cast their ballots.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I am as deeply concerned
as the rest of the nation over the unabated if not aggravated influence of
material persuasions on the choice of our elective officials.  It is truly alarming that elections in a
growing number of cases have become no more than auction sales, where the
public office </span>is <span style="">awarded to the
highest bidder </span>as <span style="">if it were an
article of commerce.  The offer of cash
in exchange for his vote would be virtually irresistible to a person mired in
poverty and </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the throes of the elemental struggle for
survival.  That there are millions of
such persons can only </span>compound this terrible situation.  But what makes it especially revolting is
the way these helpless persons are manipulated and imposed upon and tantalized
to surrender their birthright for a mess of pottage.  The unscrupulous candidates who do not hesitate to use their
wealth to buy themselves into elective office - these are the real saboteurs of
democracy.  These are the scoundrels who
would stain the pristine ballot in their cynical scheme to usurp public office
by falsifying the will <span style="">of </span>the
people.  Section 11(b) aims to minimize
this malignancy, it is true, but unfortunately by a method not allowed by the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Comment it submitted after the Solicitor General expressed
support for the petitioners, the Commission on Elections relies heavily on
Badoy v. Commission on Elections<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> to
sustain the exercise of its authority to regulate and supervise the mass media
during the election period as conferred upon it by what is now Section 4 of
Article IX in the present Constitution.  However, that case <span style="">is </span>not
in point for what was upheld there was Section 12(f) of Rep. Act No. 6132
providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The Commission on Elections shall endeavor to obtain free space
from newspapers, magazines and periodicals which shall be known as Comelec
space, and shall allocate this space equally and impartially among all
candidates within the areas in which the newspapers are circulated.  Outside of said Comelec space, it shall be
unlawful to print or publish, or cause to be <span style="">printed or </span>published, any advertisement, paid comment or paid
article in furtherance of or in opposition to the candidacy of any person for
delegate, or mentioning the name of any candidate and the fact of his
candidacy, unless all the names of all other candidates in the district in
which the candidate is running are also mentioned with equal prominence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, through Justice Makasiar (but over strong dissents
from Justices Fernando, Teehankee and Barredo), declared:</p>

<blockquote>Considering the foregoing limitation in paragraph F, Sec. 12 in the
light of the other provisions of R.A. No. 6132 designed to maximize, if not
approximate, equality of chances among the various candidates in the same
district, the said restriction on the freedom of expression appears too
insignificant to create any appreciable dent on the individual's liberty of
expression.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is challenged in the case at bar is not that law but Section
11(b), which does not merely require mention of the candidate's rivals in the
paid advertisement or commercial, an innocuous enough requirement, to be sure.  What Section 11(b) does is <u>prohibit</u>
the advertisement or commercial itself in what is unmistakably an act of
censorship that finds no justification in the circumstances here
presented.  Surely, that blanket and
absolute prohibition to use the <span style="">mass
media as a </span>vehicle for the articulation of <span style="">ideas </span>cannot, by the standards of Badoy, be considered "too
insignificant to create <span style="">any </span>appreciable
dent on the individual's liberty of expression."</p>

<p class="BODY">What is in point is Sanidad v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, through Mr. Justice Medialdea, unanimously declared
unconstitutional a regulation of the Commission on Elections providing as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 19.  Prohibition on
columnists, commentators or announcers.  - During the plebiscite campaign period, on the day before and on
plebiscite day, no mass media columnist, commentator, announcer or personality
shall use his column or radio or television time to campaign for or against the
plebiscite issues.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the argument that the said persons could still <span style="">express their views through the air time and
newspaper space to be allocated by the respondent, the Court declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Anent respondent Comelec's argument that Section 19 of Comelec
resolution 2167 does not absolutely bar petitioner-columnist from expressing
his views and/or from campaigning for or against the organic act because he may
do so through the Comelec space and/or Comelec radio/television time, the same
is not meritorious.  <u>While the
limitation does not absolutely bar petitioner's freedom of expression, it is
still a restriction on his choice of the forum where he may express his view</u>.  No reason <span style="">was </span>advanced by respondent to justify such abridgment.  We hold that this form of regulation is
tantamount to a restriction of petitioner's freedom of expression for no
justifiable reason.  (Emphasis
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This decision was
promulgated without a single dissent, even from the incumbent members then who
are now sustaining Section 11(b) of Rep. Act No. 6646.  Contrary to Justice Davide's contention,
there is not a single word in this decision upholding the prohibition in
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The respondent also
paints a distressing picture of the current political scene and expresses its
despair over the plight of the poor candidate thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Respondent Commission invites appreciation of the realities of
present-day political campaigns.  In
today's election competitions the success of one's candidacy rests to <span style="">a </span>great extent on the candidate's
ability to match the financial and material resources of the other.  Where <span style="">a
</span>candidate is given limitless opportunity to take his campaign to areas
of persuasion through the media, what is left of a winning chance for a poor,
if deserving, candidate?  But for the
regulatory power of Sec. 11(b) of Republic Act No. 6646, a wealthy candidate
could block off an opponent of lesser means from the public view by buying all
print space in newspapers and air time in radio and television.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I am certain the Court shares the apprehensions of the sober
elements of our society over the acute disadvantage of the poor candidate <u><span style="">vis-a-vis</span></u><span style=""> </span>a wealthy opponent determined to win at all costs (which he can
afford).  However, for all its anxiety
to solve this disturbingly widespread difficulty, it is inhibited, as all of us
must be, by the mandate <span style="">of </span>the
Constitution to give untrammeled rein to the dissemination and exchange of
ideas concerning the elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem is not really as bad as the respondent would imagine
it, for it is unlikely that the rich candidate would or could buy "all
print space in newspapers and air time in radio and television" to
"block off" his opponents.  Let us not be carried away by hyperbolic speculations.  After all, as the respondent itself points
out, it is empowered by the Constitution to supervise or regulate the
operations of the mass media in connection with election matters, and we may
expect that it will use this power to prevent the monopoly it fears, which
conceivably will consume all the funds the candidate is allowed to spend for
his campaign.  It should be pointed out
that the rich candidate violates no law as long as he does not exceed the
maximum amount prescribed by the Election Code for campaign expenses.  The mere fact that the poor candidate can
spend only a small fraction of that amount does not prevent the rich candidate
from spending all of it if he is so minded.  This may be a heartless way of putting it, but that is in fact how the
law should be interpreted.  The Election
Code fixes a maximum limit for all candidates, rich or poor alike; it does not
say that the rich candidate shall spend only the same amount as the poor
candidate can afford.</p>

<p class="BODY">I realize only too well that the ideas that may <span style="">be </span>conveyed by the prohibited media
advertisements will mostly be exaggerations or distortions or plain poppycock
and may intrude upon our leisure hours if not <span style="">also </span>offend our intelligence and exhaust our patience.  We may indeed be opening <span style="">a </span>Pandora's box.  But these are unavoidable in the free
society.  As part of the larger picture,
these impositions are only minor irritations that, placed in proper
perspective, should not justify the withdrawal of the great and inalienable
liberty that is the bedrock of this Republic.  It is best to remember in this regard that freedom of expression exists
not only for the thought that agrees with us, to paraphrase Justice Holmes, but
also for the thought that we abhor.</p>

<p class="BODY">I submit that all the channels of communication should be kept
open to insure the widest dissemination of information bearing on the
forthcoming elections.  An uninformed
electorate is not likely to be circumspect in the choice of the officials who
will represent them in the councils of government.  That they may exercise their suffrages wisely, it is important
that they be apprised of the election issues, including the credentials, if
any, of the various aspirants for public office.  This is especially necessary now in view of the dismaying number

Constitution that will ruthlessly bleed it white, and with it this most
cherished of our freedoms.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR.,<i> J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I fully concur with the majority opinion.  I wish, however, to express my thoughts on
some material points.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional issue raised in these cases must be decided in
the light of the provisions of our own Constitution and not on orthodox
principles or classical definitions of certain rights which have, in the course
of time and as a result of the interplay of societal forces requiring the
balancing of interests and values, been unchained from their absolutist
moorings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now settled that the freedom of speech and of the press, or
of expression, which the Bill of Rights guarantees, is not an absolute <span style="">right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, even in American jurisprudence, the overwhelming weight
of authority maintains that "the right or privilege of free speech and
publication, guaranteed by the Constitutions of the United States and of the
several states, has its limitations; the right is not absolute at all times and
under all circumstances, although limitations are recognized only in
exceptional cases.  Freedom of speech
does not comprehend the right to speak whenever, however, and wherever one
pleases, and the manner, and place, or time of public discussion can be
constitutionally controlled."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing rule proceeds from the principle that every right
or freedom carries with it the correlative duty to exercise it responsibly and
with due regard for the rights and freedoms of others.  In short, freedom is not freedom from
responsibility, but <u><span style="">with</span></u><span style=""> </span>responsibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully submit that there can be no higher form of
limitation to a right than what the Constitution itself authorizes.  On this, both the lettered and the
unlettered cannot quarrel.  In respect
to freedom of speech or expression and of the press <i>vis-a-vis</i> the
electoral process, the present Constitution lays down certain principles
authorizing allowable restraints thereon.  I refer to the following provisions of the 1987 Constitution, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1)  Section 26 of Article
II.  (Declaration of Principles and
other Policies) which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The State shall guarantee <u>equal</u> <u>access</u> <u>to</u>
<u>opportunities</u> <u>for</u> <u>public</u> <u>service</u>, and prohibit
political dynasties as may be defined by law" (underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="NUM">(2)  Section 1 of Article
XIII (Social Justice and Human rights) which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The Congress shall give highest priority to the enactment of
measures that protect and enhance the right of all the people to human dignity,
reduce social, economic, and <u>p</u><u><span style="">olitical</span></u><span style=""> <u>inequalities</u>, </span>and remove
cultural inequities by <u><span style="">equitably</span></u><span style=""> <u>diffusing</u> </span>wealth and <u>p</u><u><span style="">olitical</span></u><span style=""> <u>power</u> </span>for the common good." (underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="NUM">(3)  Section 4 of Article
IX-C which provides:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The Commission may, during the election period, <u><span style="">supervise</span></u><span style=""> <u>o</u></span><u>r</u> <u><span style="">regulate</span></u><span style=""> </span>the enjoyment or utilization of all
franchises or permits for the operation of transportation and other public
utilities, <u>media</u> <u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">communication</span></u><span style=""> <u>o</u></span><u>r</u>
<u>i</u><u><span style="">nformation,</span></u><span style=""> </span>all grants, special privileges, or
concessions granted by the government or any subdivision, agency, or
instrumentality thereof, including any government-owned or controlled
corporation or its subsidiary.  <u><span style="">Such</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>supervision</u> <u>or</u> <u>regulation</u> <u>shall</u> <u>aim</u>
<u>to</u> <u>ensure</u> <u>equal</u> <u><span style="">opportunity,</span></u><span style=""> <u>time,</u> </span><u><span style="">and</span></u><span style=""> <u>s</u></span><u>pace</u>, <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>right</u> to reply,
including reasonable, equal rates therefor, for public information campaigns
and forums among candidates in connection with the objective of holding free,
orderly, honest, peaceful, and credible elections." (underscoring
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no doubt that the first two (2) provisions
contemplate measures that would bridge the gap between the rich and the poor in
our society.  In the past, the
equilibrium sought to be achieved was only in the economic and social
fields.  Thus, before the advent of the
1987 Constitution, social justice was defined as:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Social justice is 'neither communism, nor despotism, nor
atomism, nor anarchy,' but the humanization of laws and the equalization of
social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and
objectively secular conception may at least be approximated.  Social justice means the promotion of the
welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures
calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society,
through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the
interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the
adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through
the exercise of powers underlying the existence<b> </b>of all governments on
the time-honored principle of <i><span style="">salus
populi est suprema lex.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></i></p>

<p class="2Q">Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of
the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society
and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups
as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the
fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health,
comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about ‘the greatest good to
the greatest number.’ ”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Aware of the lamentable fact that in the Philippines, no gap
between these two unavoidable extremes of society is more pronounced than that
in the field of politics, and ever mindful of the dire consequences thereof,
the framers of the present Constitution saw it fit to diffuse political power
in the social justice provisions.  Ours
has been a politics of the elite, the rich, the powerful and the pedigreed.  The victory of a poor candidate in an
election is almost always an exception.  Arrayed against the vast resources of a wealthy opponent, the former,
even if he is the most qualified and competent, does not stand a fighting
chance.  Of course, there have been
isolated instances -- but yet so few and far between -- when poor candidates
made it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forgetting first the evil use of gold, guns and goons which only
the rich have access to, and focussing strictly on the legitimate aspect of the
electoral struggle, propaganda, through the various forms of media, provides
the most sophisticated and effective means of reaching the electorate and
convincing voters to vote for a particular candidate.  It is in this area, particularly in the use of television, radio
and newspaper, that a poor candidate will not be able to compete with his
opulent opponents who have all the resources to buy prime television and radio
time and full pages of leading newspapers.  With radio and television propaganda, the wealthy candidates, even as
they leisurely relax in their homes, offices or hotel suites, can reach every
nook and cranny of their municipality, city, province, district or even the
entire Philippines and be seen or heard at any time of the day and night.  During the contracted hours, their paid
hacks can concentrate on dishonoring the poor and hapless opponent by hurling
innuendoes of defects or vice.  With
newspaper advertisements, the wealthy candidates can reach thousands of readers
daily.  A worse scenario obtains where
the rich candidates themselves fully or substantially own or operate a
television or radio station, or publish newspapers.  On the other hand, to a poor candidate, the campaign period would
sadly prove to be insufficient for him to campaign in every barangay, even if
he is running for a municipal position.  Thus, not only would he already be at a disadvantage insofar as
visibility and presentation of his issues or program of government are
concerned, he would have no opportunity to rebut whatever lies his opponents
may spread nor the chance to clear himself of false accusations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, in response to the urgent mandate of Section 1 of
Article XIII aforequoted, Congress passed a measure, R.A. No. 6646, otherwise
known as the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
introducing additional reforms to the electoral system which, <i>inter alia, </i>not
only seeks to enhance the purity of the electoral process, but also aspires to
ensure even just an approximation of equality among all candidates in their use
of media for propaganda purposes.  The
latter is best evidenced by the provision challenged in this case, Section
11(b), which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Section 11. <i>Prohibited forms of election propaganda.</i> -
In addition to the forms of propaganda prohibited under Section 85 of Batas
Pambansa Blg. 881, it shall be unlawful:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x  x  x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for any newspaper, radio broadcasting or
television station, or other mass media, or any person making use of the mass
media to sell or to give free of charge print space or air time for campaign or
other political purposes except to the Commission as<i> </i>provided under
Sections 90 and 92 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.  Any mass media columnist, commentator, announcer or personality who is a
candidate for any elective public office shall take a leave of absence from his
work as such during the campaign period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision, understood in the light of Section 4, Article
IX-C of the Constitution, is a reasonable regulation enacted to accomplish the
desired objectives and purposes earlier mentioned.  It neither constitutes proscribed abridgment of the freedom of
expression nor prohibits free speech; it merely provides the rules as to the
manner, time and place for its exercise during a very limited period.  It makes reference to Sections 90 and 92 of
Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 on <span style="">"COMELEC
</span>time" and <span style="">"COMELEC </span>space."
Said sections read in full as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">“SEC. 90. <i>Comelec space</i>. - The Commission shall procure
space in at least one newspaper of general circulation in every province or
city:  <i>Provided</i>, <i>however</i>,<i>
</i>That in the absence of said newspaper, publication shall be done in any
other magazine or periodical in said province or city, which shall be known as
‘Comelec Space’ wherein candidates can announce their candidacy.  Said space shall be allocated, free of
charge, equally and impartially by the Commission among all candidates within
the area in which the newspaper is circulated.  (Sec. 45, 1978 EC)</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">SEC. 92. <i>Comelec time.</i> - The Commission shall procure radio
and television time to be known as ‘Comelec Time’ which shall be allocated
equally and impartially among the candidates within the area of coverage of all
radio and television stations.  For this
purpose, the franchise of all radio broadcasting and television stations are
hereby amended so as to provide radio or television time, free of charge,
during the period of the campaign.  (Sec. 46, 1978 EC)"</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously then, the airing and printing of a candidate's
political advertisement can be done -- and, is even encouraged <span style="">to </span>be done -- during the "COMELEC
time" and within the <span style="">"COMELEC </span>space."
This authority of the COMELEC is no longer purely statutory.  It is now constitutional pursuant to the
clear mandate of Section 4 of Article IX-C, which is quoted above.  This constitutional grant removes whatever
doubt one may have on the split verdict of this Court in <i>Badoy vs. Ferrer,
et al..</i><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Interpreting a related provision, Section 12(f) of R.A. No. 6132, reading: </p>

<p class="2Q">"The Commission on Elections shall endeavor to obtain free
space from newspapers, magazines and periodicals which shall be known as Comelec
space, and shall allocate this space equally and impartially among all
candidates within the areas in which the newspapers are circulated.  Outside of said Comelec space, it shall be
unlawful to print or publish, or cause to be printed or published, any advertisement,
paid comment or paid article in furtherance of or in opposition to the
candidacy of any person for delegate, or mentioning the name of any candidate
and the fact of his candidacy, unless all the names of all other candidates <span style="">in </span>the district in which the candidate
is running are also mentioned with equal prominence."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Against the background of such facilities accorded by the law
for all candidates, rich and poor alike, and the prohibitions as well as penal
sanctions to insure the sanctity of the ballot against desecration and the
equality of chances among the candidates, the restriction on the freedom of
expression of the candidate or any other individual prescribed in par. F of
Sec. 12 is so narrow as not to affect the substance and vitality of <span style="">his<b> </b></span>freedom of expression
itself.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Hence, consistent with our opinion expressed in the cases of Imbong
vs. Comelec and Gonzales vs. Comelec [35 SCRA 28], this slight limitation of
the freedom of expression of the individual, whether candidate or not, as
expressed in par. F of Sec. 12, is only one of the many devices employed by the
law to prevent a clear and present danger of the perversion or prostitution of
the electoral apparatus and of the denial of the equal protection of the laws<i>.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="2Q">The fears and apprehensions of petitioner concerning his liberty of
expression in these two cases, applying the less stringent
balancing-of-interests criterion, are far outweighed by the all important
substantive interests of the State to preserve the purity of the ballot and to
render more meaningful and real the guarantee of the equal protection of the
laws."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the fairly recent case of <i><span style="">Sanidad vs. Commission on Elections,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court sustained, in effect, the validity of Section 11(b) of R.A. No.
6646.  Thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">"However, it is clear from Art. IX-C of the 1987 Constitution
that what was granted to the Comelec was the power to supervise and regulate
the use and enjoyment of <i>franchises, permits or other grants</i> issued for
the operation of transportation or other public utilities, media of
communication or information to the end that equal opportunity, time and space,
and the right to reply, including reasonable, equal rates therefor, for public
information campaigns and forums <i>among candidates </i>are ensured.  The evil sought to be prevented by this
provision is the possibility that a franchise holder may favor or give any
undue advantage <i>to</i> <i>a candidate</i> in terms of advertising space or
radio or television time.  This is also
the reason why a ‘columnist, commentator, announcer or personality, <i>who is a
candidate for any elective office </i>is required to take a leave of absence
from his work during the campaign period (2nd par. Section 11(b) R.A. 6646).’
It cannot be gainsaid that a columnist or commentator who is also a candidate
would be more exposed to the voters to the prejudice of other candidates unless
required to take a leave of absence.</p>

<p class="2Q">However, neither Article IX-C of the Constitution nor Section
11(b), 2nd par. of R.A. 6646 can be construed to mean that the Comelec has also
been granted the right to supervise and regulate the exercise <i>by media
practitioners themselves </i>of their right to expression during plebiscite
periods.  Media practitioners exercising
their freedom of expression during plebiscite periods are neither the franchise
holders nor the candidates.  In fact,
there are no candidates involved in a plebiscite.  Therefore, Section 19 of Comelec Resolution No. 2167 has no
statutory basis.</p>

<p class="2Q">In the case of Badoy, Jr. v. Comelec, L-32546, Oct. 16, 1970, where
the constitutionality  of the
prohibition of certain forms of election propaganda was assailed, We ruled
therein that the prohibition is a valid exercise of the police power of the
state ‘to prevent the perversion and prostitution of the electoral apparatus
and of the denial of equal protection of the laws.’ The evil sought to be
prevented in an election which led to Our ruling in that case does not obtain
in a plebiscite.  In a plebiscite, votes
are taken in an area on some special political matter unlike in an election
where votes are cast in favor of specific persons for some office.  In other words, the electorate is asked to
vote for or against issues, not candidates in a plebiscite."</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting for the sake of argument that a doubt exists as to
the constitutionality of the challenged provision, the doubt must be resolved
in favor of its validity.  As this Court
stated in <i><span style="">Paredes, et al. vs.
Executive Secretary, et al.:</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"x x x it is in accordance with the settled doctrine that between
two possible constructions, one avoiding a finding of unconstitutionality and
the other yielding such a result, the former is to be preferred.  That which will save, not that which will
destroy, commends itself for acceptance.  After all, the basic presumption all these years is one of
validity.  The onerous task of proving
otherwise is on the party seeking to nullify a statute.  It must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence that there is an infringement of a constitutional provision, save in those
cases where the challenged act is void on its face.  Absent such a showing, there can be no finding of
unconstitutionality.  A doubt, even if
well founded, does not suffice.  Justice
Malcolm's aphorism is<span style=""> </span><i>apropos</i>:  'To doubt is to sustain.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for this is that an act of the legislature approved by
the executive is presumed to be within constitutional bounds.  The responsibility of upholding the
Constitution rests not only on the courts, but also on the legislature and the
executive as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the Court to strike out their acts as unconstitutional,
nothing less than clear and convincing <span style="">evidence
</span>of such breach of the Constitution must be shown.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have not acquitted themselves of that duty.  The petitions then must be dismissed for lack
of merit.</p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">  DISSENTING
OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I am saddened by the readiness with which Congress, Comelec, and the
members of this Court are willing to sacrifice not only that most precious
clause of the Bill of Rights -- freedom of speech and of the press -- but also
the right of every citizen <span style="">to </span>be
informed in every way possible about the <span style="">qualifications
</span>and programs of those running for public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11(b) of R. A. No. 6646 will <span style="">certainly </span>achieve one result - keep the voters ignorant of who
the candidates are and what they stand for.</p>

<p class="BODY">With elections fast approaching, the surveys show that almost
half of the nation's voters are undecided as to the Presidency.  Certainly, they do not know <span style="">who are </span>running for the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The implementation of Section 11(b) will result in gross
inequality.  A cabinet member, an
incumbent official, a movie star, a basketball player, or a conspicuous clown
enjoys an unfair advantage over a candidate many times better qualified but
lesser known.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am shocked to find out that even the most knowledgeable people
do not know that Antonio Carpio, former NBI Director; Estelito P. Mendoza,
former Solicitor General and Governor; and Florangel Rosario Braid, member of
the Constitutional Commission and distinguished <span style="">mass </span>communication personality (to name only three) are also
running for the Senate.  We owe it to
the masses to open all forms of communication to them during this limited
campaign period.  A candidate to whom
columnists and radio-television commentators owe past favors or who share their
personal biases and convictions will get an undue amount <span style="">of </span>publicity.  Those who incur the ire of opinion makers <span style="">cannot </span>counteract negative reporting
by buying his own newspaper space or airtime for the airing of his refutations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Comelec is already overburdened with the conduct of
elections.  Only recently it proved
unequal to the task of keeping registration lists clean and had to repeat the
exercise in critical areas.  It should
now husband its resources for its real function - insuring the integrity of the
voting process and safeguarding the true results of the elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Why Comelec should also supervise the publicity campaigns of
almost 100,000 candidates running for 17,000 national and local positions is
beyond my poor power to comprehend.</p>

<p class="BODY">I reject the idea that canned publicity in a so-called Comelec
hour or Comelec corner can replace the fresh, imaginative, and personal appeal
of advertisements espousing a cause or reaching a particular audience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11(b) of R. A. No. 6646 is censorship pure and
simple.  It is particularly
reprehensible because it is imposed during the limited period of the election
campaign when information is most needed.  Moreover, the mere thought that published materials are supervised by a
government office is enough to turn the reader off.  Only faithful followers who already know for <span style="">whom </span>they are voting will bother to
read the statements of their chosen candidates in the Comelec corner of the
newspapers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The existing restrictions are more than sufficient.  Political campaigns are allowed only within
a limited period.  The amount which a
political party or candidate may spend is restricted.  Added to the confines of <u>the</u> <u>limited</u> <u>period</u>
and <u>restricted</u> <u><span style="">expenses</span></u><span style="">, </span>the law now imposes a violation of
the candidates' freedom of speech and the voters' freedom to know.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>concur fully in
the views expressed by Mr. Justice Isagani A. Cruz in his usual eloquently
brilliant style.  We should not allow
the basic freedom of expression to be sacrificed at the altar of infinitely
lesser fears and concerns.  Under the
clear and present danger rule not only must the danger be patently clear and
pressingly present but the evil sought to be avoided must be so substantive as
to justify a clamp over one's mouth or, a writing instrument to be stilled.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the precedent setting case of <u>Gonzales</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Comelec</u>
(27 SCRA 835 [1969]), seven (7) Justices (one short of the 2/3 majority needed
to invalidate the law) deemed a less restrictive statute as
unconstitutional.  The four (4) Justices
who allowed the law to remain did so only because there were various safeguards
and provisos.  Section 11(b) of R. A.
No. 6646 now removes one of those safeguards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The then Justice Fred Ruiz Castro stated:</p>

<blockquote>"What of the social value and importance of the freedoms
impaired by Section 50-B?   The
legislation strikes at the most basic political right of the citizens in a republican
system, which is the right actively to participate in the establishment or
administration of government.  This
right finds expression in multiple forms but it certainly embraces that right
to influence the shape of policy and law directly by the use of ballot.  It has been said so many times it scarcely
needs to be said again, that the realization of the democratic ideal of
self-government depends upon an informed and committed electorate.  <u>This</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>accomplished</u>
<u>only</u> <u>by</u> <u>allowing</u> <u>the</u> <u>fullest</u> <u>measure</u> <u>of</u>
<u>freedom</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>public</u> <u>discussion</u> <u>of</u> <u>candidates</u>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I will state in language as simple as I can muster why I believe
the challenged law is constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 11 of Republic Act No. 6646, otherwise known as the
"Electoral Reforms Law of 1987", challenged in these petitions, states
that:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 11.  Prohibited
Forms of Election Propaganda - In addition to the forms of election propaganda
prohibited under Section 85 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, it shall be unlawful:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(b)  For any newspaper,
radio broadcasting or television station, or other mass media, or any person
making use of the mass media to sell or to give free of charge print space or
air time for campaign or other political purposes except to the Commission as
provided under Sections 90 and 92 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881.  Any mass media columnist, commentator,
announcement (sic) or personality who is a candidate for any elective public
office shall take a leave of absence from his work as such during the campaign
period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the provision is void because it is
violative of the freedoms of the press, speech and expression as guaranteed by
Article III, Section 4 of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is fundamental that these freedoms are not immune to
regulation by the State in the legitimate exercise of its police power.</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>concept of police
power is well?established in this jurisdiction.  It has been defined as the ‘state authority to enact legislation
that may interfere with personal liberty or property in order to promote the
general welfare.’ As defined, it consists of (1) an imposition of restraint
upon liberty or property, (2) in order to foster the common good.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It constitutes an implied limitation on the Bill of
Rights.  According to Fernando, it is
'rooted in the conception that men in organizing the state and imposing upon
its government limitations to safeguard constitutional rights did not intend
thereby to enable an individual citizen or a group of citizens to obstruct
unreasonably the enactment of such salutary measures calculated to ensure
communal peace, safety, good order, and welfare.' Significantly, the Bill of
rights itself does not purport to be an absolute guaranty of individual rights
and liberties.  'Even liberty itself,
the greatest of all rights, is not unres­tricted license to act according to
one's will.' It is subject to the far more overriding demands and requirements
of the greater number."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Police power rests upon public necessity
and upon the right of the State of the public to self-protection.  For this reason, it is co-extensive with the
necessities of the case and the safeguards of public interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In Section 11 of R.A. No. 6646, the legislature aims to uphold
the State's policy of guaranteeing <u>equal</u> <u>access</u> <u>to</u> <u>opportunities</u>
<u>for</u> <u>public</u> <u>service</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Opportunity to hold a public office for public service, particularly elective
public offices must be <u>equally</u> <u>accessible</u> <u>to</u> <u>qualified</u>
<u>and</u> <u>deserving</u> <u>citizens</u>.  Corollary to this, the legislature also recognizes the power of the
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) to supervise or regulate the enjoyment or
utilization of all franchises or permits for the operation of media of
communication or information granted by the government or any subdivision,
agency or instrumentality thereof.  "Such
supervision or regulation shall aim to ensure equal opportunity, time, and
space, and the right to reply, including reasonable, equal rates therefore, for
public information campaigns and forums among candidates in connection with the
objective of holding free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible
elections."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Pablito V. Sanidad
vs. The Commission on Elections</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> we
held that the evil sought to be prevented by Art. IX-C, Section 4 of the
Constitution is the possibility that a franchise holder may favor or give any <u>undue</u>
<u>advantage</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>candidate</u> <u>in</u> <u>terms</u> <u>of</u>
<u>advertising</u> <u>space</u> <u>or</u> <u>radio</u> <u>or</u> <u>television</u>
<u>time</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In line with the objective of providing equal oppor­tunity to all
candidates, the questioned provision is intended to act as an <u>equalizer</u> <u>between</u>
<u>the</u> <u>rich</u> <u>and</u> <u>poor</u> <u>candidates</u>.  As it is, the moneyed candidate has the
funds to engage in a myriad of campaign activities.  To allow the rich candidates to have free reign over the use of
media for their campaign would result in an unfair advantage over the poor candidates
who have no funds or have meager funds to secure print space and air time, and
yet, they may be equally qualified and deserving candidates.  In <u>Anacleto D. Badoy, Jr. vs. Jaime N.
Ferrer, et al</u>., G.R. NO. L-32546, October 17, 1970, 35 SCRA, 285, this
Court declared Section 12(F) of R.A. No. 6132 valid and constitutional,
recognizing that the purpose of the limitation, on the freedom of the candidate
or his sympathizer to spend his own money for his candidacy alone and not for
the furtherance of the candidacy of his opponents, is to give the poor
candidates a fighting chance in the election.  In the same manner, Sec. 11 of R.A. No. 6646 aims to maximize, if not
approximate, <u>equality</u> <u>of</u> <u>chances</u> <u>among</u> <u>the</u> <u>various</u>
<u>candidates</u> for elective public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners aver that by restoring to the print and broadcast
media industry the right to sell print space or air time for campaign or other
political purposes, access to print space and air time would be given equally
to all candidates.  Nevertheless, as opined
by the COMELEC, the means to gain access to said time and space would be
unequal among all candidates.  Hence,
there would be in the final analysis, inequality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, to tolerate even indirectly over-spending in print
space or air time for campaign purposes will open the floodgates to corruption
in public office because a winning candidate who overspends during the election
period must necessarily recover his campaign expenses by "hook or
crook".  Section 11 of R.A. No.
6646 would indirectly constitute a positive and effective measure against
corruption in public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also contend that the challenged provision is
"violative of the people's right to information particularly about the
conduct of public officials including the character and qualifications of
candidates seeking public office."</p>

<p class="BODY">I do not adhere to the proposition that "the electorate will
not have the opportunity for quality decision in expressing its mandate - no
sufficient fora to detect and decide for themselves who, among the candidates
truly deserve their votes."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from Sec. 11(b) of R.A. No. 6646 providing for <u>Comelec
space</u> and <u>Comelec time</u>, Sections 9 and 10 of the same law afford a
candidate several venues by which he can fully exercise his freedom of expression,
including freedom of assembly.  The
electorate, in turn, are given opportunities to know the candidates and be
informed of their qualifications and platforms.</p>

<p class="BODY">As provided in Section 9 of R.A. No. 6646, the COMELEC shall
encourage non-political, non-partisan private or civic organizations to
initiate and hold in every city and munici­pality, public for a at which all
registered candidates for the same office may simultaneously and personally
partici­pate to present, explain, and/or debate on their campaign platforms and
programs and other like issues.  Section
10, on the other hand, allows the candidates the use of the designated common
poster areas to post, display and exhibit election propaganda to announce or further
their candidacy; not to mention the right to hold political caucuses, confe­rences,
meetings, rallies, parades, or other assemblies for the purpose of soliciting
votes and/or undertaking any campaign or propaganda for a candidate; publishing
or distributing campaign literature or materials designed to support the
election of any candidate; and directly or indirectly solicit votes, pledges or
support for a candidate.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In short, the law in question (Sec. 11, Rep. Act No. 6646) has
been enacted for a legitimate public purpose and the means it employs to
achieve such purpose are reasonable and even timely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on all the foregoing considerations, I vote to sustain the
validity and constitutionality of Section II of R.A. No. 6646.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PARAS,<i> J.</i>:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a ghastly blow against our cherished liberties, the Supreme
Court, with insensate, guillotine-like efficiency, rendered <span style="">a </span>decision which in the interest of accuracy
and candidness, I would like to turn – the serious attack on our freedom of
expression.  It is sad but I have no
choice except to say that I dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The freedom to advertise one's political candidacy in the various
forms of media is clearly a significant part of our freedom of expression and
of our right of access to information.  Freedom of expression in turn includes among other things, freedom of
speech and freedom of the press.  Restrict these freedoms without <span style="">rhyme
or </span>reason, and you violate the most valuable feature of the democratic
way of life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority says that the purpose of the political advertisement
provision is to prevent those who have much money from completely overwhelming
those who have little.  This is gross
error because should the campaign for votes be carried out in other <span style="">for a (for example, </span>rallies and
meetings) the rich candidate can always be at a great advantage over his less
fortunate opponent.  And so the
disparity feared will likewise appear in campaigns other than through
media.  It is alleged also that the
candidate with money can purchase for himself several full page advertisements,
making his poor opponents really poor in more ways than one.  This is not realistic for the poor opponents
may, far certain reasons be given or favored with advertisements free of
charge, and money will not be needed in this case.  And yet under the statute in question, even <u>free</u> or <u>gratuitous</u>
advertisements in print, in radio or in television are included <span style="">in </span>the prohibition.  And then again, it is contended by the
majority that a poor candidate can still <span style="">make
use </span>of media by consenting to interviews and news reports about his
campaign, which interviews and reports are, according to the majority still
allowable.  But then these interviews
and news reports are still subtle advertisements and they can be had if a
candidate deliberately looks for media practitioners to interview him or to
write about him.  If the majority is to
be consistent, these interviews and news reports should also be
disallowed.  A case in point is the
senatorial candidate who was interviewed on television last Tuesday (March 3,
1992).  Portions of the interview
follow:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
19<span style="">___, </span>were you not the Secretary
of_____________?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
I was.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q. <span style=""> </span>When
you were Secretary, did you not accomplish the following?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(Interviewer
then enumerated various <u>accomplishments</u>.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
I did."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There can be no doubt
that this interview is disguised propaganda, and yet, if we follow the Majority
</span>opinion, this is <span style="">allowable.  </span>Is <span style="">this not illogical - </span>that <span style="">is,
if the ban stays?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And then again, if we<span style=""> </span>were
to consider the ban as constitutional, the "unknown" or "lesser
known" candidates would <span style="">be at </span>a
distinct disadvantage.  They will have
to hold numerous rallies (spending oodles and oodles<span style=""> </span>of money).  And only
those who had previously received public exposure by dint <span style="">of </span>government service or by prominence
in the movies, in music, in sports, etc. <span style="">will
</span>be the ones <span style="">"</span>r<span style="">ecalled" </span>by the voters.  This w<span style="">ill
</span>indeed be unfortunate for our country.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that freedom of speech and freedom of the press are
not absolute, and that they have their own limitations.  But I do not see how these limitations <span style="">can make the </span>disputed prohibition
valid and constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore reiterate my opinion that this political ads
prohibition is grossly unfair, <span style="">politica</span><span style="">lly </span>inept and eminently
unconstitutional.</p>
