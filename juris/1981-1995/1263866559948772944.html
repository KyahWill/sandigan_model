<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 2, 1980, the
Director of Mines and Geo-Sciences rendered a decision declaring and
recognizing the preferential right of therein petitioner June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett to explore, develop, exploit and lease the area

heirs of John and Maria <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span> interposed an appeal
on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November 4, 1982</span></st1:date><span style=""> to the Office of the President, docketed therein as MNR Case No. </span>5096,
<span style="">but failed to prosecute the </span>same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Private
respondents later filed their respective motions for reconsideration which,
however, proved to be belated as the decision of respondent Minister had
already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The finality of the
decision notwithstanding, respondent Minister of Natural Resources rendered

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25,
 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner
sought the reconsideration of the decision and prayed for a </span><u>status</u>

Office of the Minister of Natural Resources issued the </span><u>status</u> <u>quo</u>

from receipt of the order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, none
of the respondents complied therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">February 19, </span>1985, with the motion for
<span style="">reconsideration still </span>unresolved,
petitioner filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, with a
prayer for preliminary injunction, before this <span style="">Court, docketed </span>as G.R. No. 69937, for the nullification of the
decision of respondent Minister of Natural Resources dated June 25, 1984 and to
restrain public respondent <span style="">from further
proceeding in said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
contended that respondent Minister acted with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction in rendering said decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1985</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to refer the case to the Court of Appeals (then
Intermediate Appellate Court) for determination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1985</st1:date>, respondent court initially dismissed the petition for
being premature inasmuch as petitioner had an unresolved motion for
reconsideration pending in the Office of the <span style="">Minister </span>of Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner prayed for the reconsideration of the dismissal and informed
respondent court that her motion for reconsideration had been denied by the
Minister of Natural Resources on <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="1">January
 31, 1985</st1:date>, notice of which she received only on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also filed with this Court on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1985</st1:date> an addendum to the
petition giving the same information, not knowing that said petition had been
referred to respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1985</st1:date>,
respondent court reconsidered its decision dismissing the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it thereafter ruled against
petitioner, holding that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies
and <span style="">for which the petition must be
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cited Section 50,
Presidential Decree No. 463, as authority for its ruling, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 50.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Appeals</u>
- Any party not satisfied with the decision or order of the Director may within
five (5) days from receipt thereof, appeal to the Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Decisions of the Secretary are likewise <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> within five (5) days from receipt thereof by the
affected party to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
whose decision shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Corollarily</span></span><span style="">, respondent court declared that it had no
authority to grant petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction to enjoin the implementation of the questioned decision
as it is precluded from doing so by Presidential Decree No. 605, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No court of
the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any restraining order,
preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory injunction in any case
involving or growing out of the issuance, approval or disapproval, revocation
or suspension of, or any action whatsoever by the proper administrative
official or body on concessions, licenses, permits, patents or public grants of
any kind in connection with the disposition, exploitation, utilization,
exploration and/or development of the natural resources of the
Philippines."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the instant
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="3"><span style="">March
 24, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, after the
Brett spouses filed the above-mentioned petition in this Court, James Brett
wrote a letter to the newly appointed Minister of Natural Resources Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> praying that the former minister's decision of </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1984</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>be
rectified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1986</st1:date>, respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> did set aside Minister <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a's</span> aforesaid decision and reinstated <span style="">the ministry's original decision of </span><st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October
 6, 1982</span></st1:date><span style=""> and that of
the Director of Mines in favor of Brett.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon being notified of
Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda's</span> decision against them, on June 19,
1986 petitioners filed with this Court in the pending case G.R. No. 74223 a
petition to declare the order of June 10, 1986 issued by respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> ineffectual, null, void and illegal for having been
issued without jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Four days later,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>or on June 23, 1986, they also filed before
respondent court a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No.
09349, praying that respondents therein be enjoined from enforcing the order
and that the same be declared null and </span><span style="">void.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners likewise sent
an appeal to the Office of the President, docketed as O.P. Case No. 3360,
praying for the reversal of the order of </span><st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="6"><span style="">June 10, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Acting thereon, said office, through Assistant Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Magdangal</span> Elma, ordered </span>the Ministry to elevate the
records of MNR Case No. 5096, the appellant to pay the appeal fee of P50.00,
and the parties to file their respective<span style="">
memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Subsequently ruling on
the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 09349 in a decision dated </span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="10"><span style="">October
 24, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
court found merit in said petition but nonetheless dismissed the same, taking
note of the fact that there is an appeal by petitioners of respondent </span>minister's
decision pending in the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it cited Section 17 of the<span style=""> Interim Rules of Court which provides that
"no petition for <i>certiorari</i> may be filed in the Intermediate
Appellate Court if another similar petition has been filed or is still pending
in the Supreme Court," a violation of the rule being a ground for the
dismissal of both petitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On these facts rests this
second petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">II. </span>Shorn of
unnecessary details, the issues formulated and raised by the parties in the
aforesaid two petitions, and their respective contentions thereon, are
succinctly discussed hereunder <u>seriatim</u>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>G.R. No. 74223</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In her so-called
assignment of errors, June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett faults
respondent court for not holding that respondent minister acted without or in
excess of jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion and asks us to
resolve -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
respondent court erred in dismissing petitioner's original action for certiorari
on the ground of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not
respondent court erred in invoking Presidential Decree No. 605 to deny
petitioner's prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="color: black; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In amplification of her
plaint, June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett contends that the case at
bar is an instance where resort to administrative remedies was no longer
necessary and advisable since it is one where the </span>recognized exceptions
to the doctrine come into play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
manifestly refers to, among the other <span style="">exceptions,
Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a's</span> alleged patent </span>lack <span style="">of jurisdiction in reversing his previous
decision which she claims had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concerning respondent court's invocation of
Presidential </span>Decree No. 605, she submits that the same does not <span style="">authorize the courts to shed or abdicate
their inherent judicial authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, all of
the private </span>respondents make the riposte that Section 50, Presidential
Decree No. 463 provides for and thereby constitutes a plain, speedy and
adequate remedy to contest and seek a review and reversal <span style="">of the decision of Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett having failed to avail of the same, she cannot
invoke the jurisdiction of the courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As an offshoot, private respondents point out that her failure to
perfect a timely appeal to the Office of the President rendered the </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1984</span></st1:date><span style=""> decision of
Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a</span> final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>,
therefore, overstepped his authority in rendering the </span><st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="6"><span style="">June 10,
 1986</span></st1:date><span style=""> decision which
should be declared null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>G.R. No. 77098</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On their part, the heirs
of John <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>, Sr. desire a resolution on whether
or not respondent court erred in dismissing their original action for <i>certiorari</i>
on the ground of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of their appeal in the
Office of the President and a similar petition with this Court.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Said heirs explain that
what they did was only to write a personal letter to the President complaining
about the alleged unwarranted action by </span>respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter,
so it is alleged, was unsubscribed and <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> and,
therefore, should not be considered as "a remedy in <span style="">the course of law." With regard to the
petition filed with this Court, these heirs of John <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>,
</span>Sr. claim that the same was intended only to be <span style="">a manifestation but was erroneously captioned as a </span>"petition."
In any event, they insist that their <span style="">case
falls under the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies, the order </span>of <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="6">June 10,
 1986</st1:date> having been issued without <span style="">jurisdiction and without giving them an opportunity to be heard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span>
Brett, on the other hand, adheres to the findings of respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She moreover adopts the explanation made by
Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> in his comment filed in G.R. No.
74223 to the effect that the order of June 10, 1986 was issued in the exercise
of his office's inherent power to correct its orders so as to make them
conformable to law and justice and under respondent minister's authority as </span><u>alter</u>
<u>ego</u> <span style="">of the President pursuant to
Section 2, Article IV of Proclamation </span>No. 3, otherwise known as the
"Freedom Constitution of the Philippines," to review all contracts,
concessions, permits or other forms of privileges for the exploration,
development, exploitation or <span style="">utilization
of natural resources entered into, granted, issued or acquired before the date
of said proclamation, and when the national interest requires, to amend, modify
or revoke them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find merit in and
consequently sustain the petition in G.R. No. 74223.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that in our
jurisdiction, unless otherwise provided by law or required by public interest,
before bringing an action in or resorting to the courts of justice, all
remedies of administrative character affecting or determinative of the
controversy at that level should first be exhausted by the aggrieved party.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is likewise true,
however, that the doctrine </span>of <span style="">exhaustion
of administrative remedies is not a hard and fast rule.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Foremost among the exceptions is when the assailed
act, order or decision is patently illegal or was performed or issued without
jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, it is
our considered opinion that the decision in question, dated </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, is of such a
defective nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision, it
superseded, dated </span><st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October 6, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">, was already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the belated motions for reconsideration by all the private respondents in G.R.
No. 74223 being patently time-barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
course, the aforesaid heirs of John and Maria <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>
did file a timely appeal but they likewise failed to prosecute the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious and indisputable, therefore,
that respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a</span> gravely abused his
discretion in reversing his original decision which precisely prompted June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett to forthwith invoke the jurisdiction of the
courts.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The circumstance that the
</span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">
decision was rendered without jurisdiction is itself confirmed by respondent
court in CA-G.R. SP No. 09349 which is the subject of our review in G.R. No.
77098, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The decision dated October 6, 1982 of
the Minister of Natural Resources in MNR Case No. 5096 which the Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span> received on October 25, 1982, became final on
October 30, 1982 since it was not appealed to the Office of the President

already become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, his
amended decision of <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1984</st1:date>
was void for lack of jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, as therein
petitioner June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett pointed out, the
necessity of giving finality to judgments that are not void is
self-evident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interests of society
impose it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">opposing view might make litigation </span>more
<span style="">unendurable than the wrongs it is
intended to redress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would create
doubt, real or imaginary, and controversy would constantly arise as to what the
judgment or order was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is noteworthy that none
of the private respondents in G.R. No. 74223 ever mentioned anything in their
pleadings filed with this Court nor squarely </span>met June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett's allegation that Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a's</span>
decision of <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1982</st1:date>
had become <span style="">final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
obviously avoiding the issue, mindful that the same would be detrimental to
their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That allegation of the
decision being final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> was, however,
established </span>as a fact by respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We certainly cannot gloss over such finding
which has remained <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> and undisputed by
said private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Going back to the subject
of non-exhaustion of administrative remedies, June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span>
Brett's failure to appeal to the Office of the President from the decision of
Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a</span> cannot also be considered a violation
of the rule as the latter is the <u>a</u></span><u><span style="">lter</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>ego</u>
<span style="">of </span>the <span style="">President and, under the doctrine of qualified political agency, his
action is deemed to be that of </span>the President.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Parenthetically, while
the original action for <i>certiorari</i> cannot be made a substitute for
appeal,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a's</span>

justify June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett's resort to the special
civil action for <i>certiorari</i> in lieu of the appeal provided for by
Section 50 of </span>Presidential Decree No. 463.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may also add to these considerations the
urgency for judicial intervention<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
called for by the fact that, as <span style="">specifically
provided in said provision itself, the decision of respondent Minister of
Natural Resources </span>becomes <span class="SpellE">executory</span> despite an
appeal to the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall not, for the
nonce, pass judgment on respondent court's refusal to restrain the execution of
respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">PeÃ±a's</span> decision under the
authority of Presidential Decree No. 605 since the resolution of the issue
raised by June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett on the matter, i.e., that
it does not authorize the court to divest itself of its inherent judicial
authority, would entail an inquiry </span><span style="">into
</span><span style="">the constitutional validity of
the decree which we are not disposed to do in the present case since the
controversy can be resolved on grounds other than constitutional.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> For that matter, under our disposition of
these cases there is no necessity for resolving this issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All told, we hold that respondent court erred in dismissing June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> Brett's action for <i>certiorari</i> for failure to
exhaust administrative remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">IV. We are, on the other hand, constrained to reject and deny the
petition in G.R. No. 77098 for being devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even conceding that the pleading filed by the heirs of John <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>, Sr. with this Court was only a manifestation and
not a petition to annul the order of Minister <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>,
it is of record that said heirs have a perfected and pending appeal with the
Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether the
appeal was perfected by filing a formal notice of appeal or a mere <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> and unsubscribed personal letter is of no
moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that the Office of
the President has taken cognizance of the case as one for its appellate review <span style="">and has in fact ordered the parties to file
their respective memoranda therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the doctrine of
primary jurisdiction, courts cannot and will not determine a controversy
involving a question which is within the jurisdiction of an administrative
tribunal, especially where the question demands the exercise of sound
administrative discretion requiring the special knowledge, experience and
services of the administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate
matters of fact and where a uniformity of ruling is essential to comply with
the purposes of the regulatory statute administered.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Applying the principle in
the case at bar, respondent court correctly dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
of the heirs of John <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>, Sr. on the ground that
there is a pending appeal filed by said heirs in the Office of the
President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the award of mining
claims is more of an executive, and less of a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">judicial, function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the issue as to the validity of the authority
under which then respondent Minister Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>
issued the order of </span><st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="6"><span style="">June 10, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, which reversed the void decision of </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, can be
competently determined by the executive department at the initial stage of the
quasi-</span><span style="">judicial </span><span style="">proceeding therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While it may plausibly be
contended that the case for the heirs of John <span class="SpellE">Guilles</span>,
Sr. could also fall under the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of
administrative remedies, just like that of June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span>
Brett </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">G.R. No. 74223 and thereby justify their
immediate coming to court, there is a marked difference in their respective
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner June <span class="SpellE">Prill</span> </span>Brett, in G.R. No. 74223, never appealed to
the Office of the President, unlike the heirs of John <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Guilles</span></span><span style="">, Sr. in G.R. No. 77098.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
spelled the difference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any event, the order
of respondent Minist</span><span style="">er</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> is </span>only
<span style="">confirmatory of the decision of </span><st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="10"><span style="">October
 6, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It in fact reinstated the said decision and </span>noted
<span style="">that it had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for which reason the </span><st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25, 1984</span></st1:date><span style=""> decision </span>was <span style="">void </span>and of no force and effect.</p>
