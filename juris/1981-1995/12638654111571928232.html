alleging that the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> power of administration

over, much like a court-appointed receiver, such as to bring and defend actions
in its own name; receive rents; collect debts due; and generally do such other
acts and things as may be necessary to fulfill its mission as conservator and
administrator." The PCGG likewise invoked Section 11 of Rule 57 of the

<p class="2Q">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lease over

<p class="BODY">Under date of November 7, 1989, petitioner manifested to this
Court that the aircraft subject of the petition had been sold by PCGG to Walter
Fuller Aircraft, Inc. on September 28, 1989 "to preserve the value of the
aircraft and to prevent its rapid deterioration," pursuant to which the
"sequestration was (then) lifted, and it would be substituted by the
proceeds of the sale deposited in escrow, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG asseverates that the sale of the subject aircraft is in
pursuance, of the exercise of its administrative power to preserve and conserve
sequestered assets under its control and supervision; that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> may not interfere with <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
decision to sell the aircraft or with an act involving an exercise of
administrative discretion of PCGG consonant with <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
mandated duty to preserve and conserve the sequestered asset; that the
"courtesy"' motion to sell the sequestered aircraft pending
litigation was "filed by the PCGG purely in deference to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and by way of informing the said court about
the sale; that equitable and pragmatic considerations justify the PCGG decision
to sell the aircraft; that the determination by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
as to the ownership of the said aircraft prior to the termination of the trial
of the case is premature; and that there exists <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence to justify the sequestration of the aircraft.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="">Contrarily and in support of its assailed
resolution, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> argues that no prima
facie evidence exists to warrant the sequestration of the subject aircraft, and
that the sale thereof requires prior judicial authority from the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I. It is the submission of the PCGG that its power to administer
and conserve necessarily includes the authority to sell sequestered assets
which are in immediate danger of deterioration or dissipation, such as the
aircraft subject of this petition, since, after all, the purpose of such sale
is to preserve the remaining value of the assets in the form of cash placed in
escrow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It avers that the sale of the
aircraft is in pursuit of its mandated objectives of conserving or preserving
the sequestered asset in the valid exercise of its discretionary administrative
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise asserts that in
accordance with the ruling laid down in <u>Presidential Commission on Good
Government. et al. vs. Securities and Exchange Commission, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
(SEC case), it may resort to "acts of strict ownership" provided said
acts are for the objective of conservation, preservation or otherwise
prevention of dissipation of sequestered assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, in the SEC case above adverted to, held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> To our mind, though, it is not so much the nature of the
act proposed to be done by the PCGG that is essential, but rather, the purpose
for doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prime consideration
should be: is the act proposed to be done by the PCGG merely an act of
administration or an act of strict ownership essential to the pursuit of its
objectives?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it cannot be totally
discounted that situations may arise wherein only through an act of strict
ownership can the PCGG be able to prevent the dissipation of the assets of the
sequestered corporation or <span class="SpellE">business.'x</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cited case involves the power of the PCGG to vote the
sequestered shares for the purpose of deleting from the Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws of Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc.
(ETPI) the "right of first refusal" clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While recognizing the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
right to exercise acts of strict ownership necessary to the attainment of its
objectives, the Court denied therein said right from the PCGG for the reason
that "[w]e cannot see our way clear as to how this move could help prevent
the dissipation of the corporation's assets, particularly when it has its own
representatives in the Board of Directors, who can effectively provide such
measures and safeguards to prevent such dissipation."</p>

<p class="BODY">The leading BASECO case, hereinbefore cited, emphasized in no
uncertain terms that the PCGG has only powers of administration, hence it may
not exercise acts of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bears
repeating for convenient reference what the Court underscored therein:</p>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>PCGG May Not
Exercise .Acts of Ownership</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>One thing is certain, and should be stated at the outset the <u>PCGG
cannot exercise acts of dominion</u> over property sequestered, frozen or
provisionally taken over. "As already earlier stressed with no little
insistence, the act of sequestration, freezing or provisional takeover of
property does not import or bring about a divestment of title over said
property; does not make the PCGG the owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In relation to the property sequestered,
frozen or provisionally taken over, the <u>PCGG is a conservator, not an owner</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it can not perform acts of strict
ownership; and this is specially true in the situations contemplated by the
sequestration rules where, unlike cases of receivership, for example, no court
exercises effective supervision or can, upon due application and hearing, grant
authority for the performance of acts of dominion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Equally evident is that the resort to the provisional remedies in
question should entail the least possible interference with business operations
or activities so that, in the event that the accusation of the business
enterprise being ‘ill-gotten' be not proven, it may be returned, to its
rightful owner as far as possible in the same condition as it was at the time
of sequestration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>PCGG Has Only
Powers of Administration</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The PCGG may thus exercise only powers of administration over the
property or business sequestered or provisionally taken over, much like a
court-appointed receiver, such as to bring and defend actions in its own name;
receive rents, collect debts due; pay outstanding debts; and generally do such
other acts and things as may be necessary to fulfill its mission as conservator
and administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this context, it
may in addition enjoin or restrain any actual or threatened commission of acts
by-any person or entity that may render moot and academic, or frustrate or
otherwise make ineffectual its efforts to carry out its task; punish for direct
or indirect contempt in accordance with the Rules of Court; and seek and secure
the assistance of any office, agency or instrumentality of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of sequestered businesses
generally (i.e., going concerns, businesses in current operation), as in the
case of sequestered objects, its essential role, as already discussed, is that
of conservator, caretaker, "watchdog’ or overseer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not that of manager, or innovator, much
less an owner." (Emphasis in the original text.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To this, general rule, an exception was also provided for, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>"d.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Voting of
Sequestered Stock; Conditions <span class="SpellE">Therefor</span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>So, too, it is within the parameters of these conditions and
circumstances that the PCGG may properly exercise the prerogative to vote
sequestered stock of corporations, granted to it by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
through a Memorandum dated <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="6">June 26,
 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Memorandum
authorizes the PCGG, ‘pending the outcome of proceedings to determine the
ownership of * * (sequestered) shares of stock,' to vote<span style="">&nbsp; </span>such shares of stock as it may have
sequestered in corporations at all stockholders' meetings called for the
election of directors, declaration of dividends, amendment of Articles of
Incorporation, etc.' The Memorandum should be construed in such a manner as to
be consistent with, and not contradictory of the Executive Orders earlier
promulgated on the same matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
should be no exercise of the right to vote simply because the <span style="">right exists or because the stocks
sequestered constitute the controlling or a substantial part of the corporate
voting power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stock is not to-be
voted to replace directors, or revise the articles or by-laws," or
otherwise bring about substantial changes in policy, program or practice of the
corporation except for demonstrably weighty and defensible grounds, and always
in the context of the stated purposes of sequestration or provisional takeover,
i.e., to prevent the dispersion or undue disposal of the corporate assets, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Presidential Memorandum of <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1986</st1:date> referred to in the BASECO case reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Consistent with Executive Order Nos. 1, 2 and 14, as regards
recovery of ill-gotten wealth, the Commission is authorized to vote such shares
of stock as it may have sequestered in corporations at all stockholders'
meetings called for the election of directors; declaration of dividends;
amendment of the Articles of Incorporation; adoption and amendment of by-laws;
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of all or
substantially all of corporate properties,-incurring, creating. or increasing
bonded indebtedness; increase or decrease of capital stock; merger or
consolidation of the corporation with another or other corporations; investment
of corporate funds in another corporation or business or for purposes other
than the primary purpose for which it was organized; or for similar purposes

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing pronouncements, we hold that the
ruling laid down in the SEC case relied upon by the PCGG should be given a
strict and limited interpretation and application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the PCGG may perform such acts of
strict ownership only as may necessarily be required by or result from the
exercise of its vested power to vote on the sequestered shares of stock of a
corporation; and, secondly, such act is essential to the attainment of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> stated purpose for sequestration, i.e., to prevent
the dissipation of the corporate assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the PCGG has categorically stated that the
sale of the subject aircraft is in pursuance of its administrative duty to
preserve and conserve the sequestered asset.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have earlier discussed, quoting our ruling in the BASECO case, the various
acts falling within the ambit of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> power of
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sale of sequestered
property, which is an attribute of ownership, is ordinarily not within the
“preservation and conservation" aspect of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
administrative objectives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis
of our preceding discussions, the instant case is not necessarily one of the
situations contemplated by the law and jurisprudence mentioned therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus patently erroneous for the PCGG to
rely only on our ruling in the SEC case, which involves the exercise of an act
of strict ownership, in order to sanction an act which is clearly beyond the
realm of its administrative powers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, proper court authority, i.e., the approval of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, is a condition <u>sine qua non</u> to the
sale of the sequestered aircraft, the lack of which constitutes a grave abuse
of discretion on the part of PCGG and would render the sale null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the filing-of the motion to sell was merely in deference or
an act of "courtesy “to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and
did not necessarily mean that the PCGG was invoking the court's authority is,
to our mind, a belated and contrived submission of the PCGG designed to becloud
the resultant implications of such act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For all intents and purposes, the filing of the motion to sell must be
considered as an outright recognition by the PCGG of the power of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> to allow or disallow the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot now dispute such authority after
it, had submitted thereto and had obtained an adverse judgment <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">II. The PCGG insists that respondent cannot interfere in its
decision to sell the subject aircraft, on the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
assumption that the exercise of such discretion is in pursuance of it's
administrative duty to preserve and conserve sequestered assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we are not discounting the ruling enunciated in <u>Presidential
Commission on Good Government vs. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, etc, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
(PENA case) invoked by the PCGG, reiterating the elementary principle that
"purely administrative and discretionary functions may not be interfered
with by the courts," suffice it to say that this doctrine finds no proper
application to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
hereinbefore explained, the sale of a sequestered asset is not within the
limited .administrative powers vested in the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY">III. It is likewise the theory of the PCGG that the similarity
between its power of sequestration and the provisional remedy of preliminary
attachment or receivership is exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By this, it means that the similarity refers only to the fact that the
property under sequestration, receivership or preliminary attachment may be
sold <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">lite</span></u>
whenever necessary, such as perishable goods or where the sale will <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> the interests of all parties to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contends that the only difference between
the sale of assets under sequestration and those under ordinary attachment or
receivership is that in the. former, the decision to sell involves <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> exercise of executive or administrative discretion,
while in the latter, the decision involves the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
exercise of judicial discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
so it claims, while property under preliminary attachment may be sold only upon
authority of the court having jurisdiction over the main case,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
this rule does not apply to sequestered properties for the following reasons:
(1) the writ of preliminary attachment is issued by the court while the writ of
sequestration is issued by the PCGG; (2) the authority to sell the property
under preliminary attachment is derived from the Rules of Court while that of
sequestration emanates from Executive Order Nos. 1 and 2; and (3) while the
property in preliminary attachment is deemed under the custody of the court,
the sequestered property is under the custody of PCGG.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The thesis does not merit acceptance.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have deliberated on and resolved this issue in the BASECO case,
which we reiterated in <u>Republic of the </u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Philippines</u></st1:place></st1:country-region><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
(REPUBLIC case), thus:</p>

<blockquote>"f.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Kinship to
Attachment, Receivership</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>As thus described, sequestration, freezing and provisional takeover
are akin to the provisional remedy of preliminary attachment, or
receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By attachment, a sheriff
seizes property of a defendant in a civil suit so that it may stand as security
for the satisfaction of any judgment that may be obtained, and not disposed of,
or dissipated, or lost intentionally or otherwise, pending the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By receivership, property, real or personal,
which is subject of litigation, is placed in the possession and control of a
receiver appointed by the Court, who shall conserve it pending final
determination of the title or right of possession over it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these remedies - sequestration, freezing,
provisional takeover, attachment and receivership - are provisional, temporary,
designed for particular, exigencies, attended by no character of permanency or
finality, and always subject to the control of the issuing court or
agency." (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the REPUBLIC case, we declared that "the PCGG' s. power
to sequester alleged ill-gotten properties is likened to the provisional
remedies of preliminary attachment or receivership which are always subject to
the control of the court." As a matter of fact, there is nothing in the
BASECO case nor in the REPUBLIC case which would at least indicate or suggest
that there exists such an exception as is theorized by the PCGG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, we have even likened a
sequestration order to the remedies of preliminary attachment and receivership
on several aspects, such as, that it may be issued <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>;
no objection of any significance may be raised to its <u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
.issuance; and there must be <u>prima facie</u> evidence as basis for the
issuance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the PCGG
has not advanced any substantial argument as will justify a deviation from the
broad authority of the courts in respect to the aforementioned provisional
remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, we cannot rule
differently.</p>

<p class="BODY">IV. The issue on the existence of <u>prima facie</u> evidence in
support of the issuance of a sequestration order has likewise been laid to rest
in the BASECO case, in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Requisites for
Validity</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>What is indispensable is that, again as in the case of attachment
and receivership, there exist a <u>prima facie</u> factual foundation, at
least, for the sequestration, freeze or takeover order, and adequate and fair
opportunity to contest it and endeavor to cause its negation or nullification.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Both are assured under the executive orders in question and the
rules and regulations promulgated by the PCGG.</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Prima Facie
Evidence as Basis for Orders</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Executive Order No. 14 enjoins that there be “due regard to the
requirements of fairness and due process.’ Executive Order No. 2 declares that
with respect to claims on allegedly ‘ill-gotten' assets and .properties.
"it is the position of the new democratic government that President Marcos
* * (and other parties affected) be afforded fair opportunity to contest these
claims before appropriate Philippine authorities.' Section 7 of the
Commission's Rules and Regulations provides that sequestration or freeze (and
takeover) orders, issue upon the authority of at least two commissioners, based
on the <u>affirmation or complaint of an interested party, or <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></u> when the
Commission has <u>reasonable grounds</u> to believe that the issuance thereof
is warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A similar requirement is
now found in Section 26, Art. XVIII of the 1987 Constitution, which requires
that a ‘sequestration or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a <u>prima
facie</u> case.’” [Emphasis in the original text.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The orders or decisions of PCGG are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> whose resolutions or decisions
are, in turn <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned resolution of respondent is premised primarily on
the requirement that there can be no valid sequestration of the aircraft absent
a showing that <u>prima facie</u> evidence exists in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG claims otherwise, and we quote at
length its contentions in its reply dated April 25. 1990:</p>

Authority to Sell the AIRCRAFT was extensively argued with Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Miranda appearing for the PCGG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the attention of the PCGG was
called to the fact that the very Certificate of Registration of the AIRCRAFT

so that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There appeared to

<p class="2Q">(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certainly, that
there would be no basis for further keeping the AIRCRAFT in sequestration at
all, since the lease of the AIRCRAFT, according to the PCGG itself during oral
argument, had apparently expired in 1987, two years' prior to the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> Motion for Authority to Sell that AIRCRAFT</p>

<blockquote>The PCGG, however, through the Solicitor General's representatives,
particularly Solicitor Miranda, categorically declared in open Court that it
would not go into who <u>was</u> the owner of the AIRCRAFT at that time, even
if the lease thereof, in favor of UNICHEM had already expired, and no prodding
from the Court, produced any information or clarification on the matter of
ownership of the AIRCRAFT or the basis for its original sequestration, much
less on the continuation of the sequestration of the AIRCRAFT after the expiry
of the lease thereof </blockquote>

even intimated to the Court anything that is now contained in pages 27 and 28 <span style="">of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>

who allegedly acted a(s) <span class="SpellE">Faysound's</span> agent in the

<blockquote>all of which allegedly
constitute more than prima facie evidence for PCGG to have sequestered the
AIRCRAFT.]"<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot, therefore, fault the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
for denying the motion to sell the aircraft considering that the PCGG adamantly
refused to present evidence in support of its claim that there was a valid sequestration
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can the PCGG in all
good faith impute a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
one, we do not subscribe to the theory of the Solicitor General that it is not
supposed to present evidence during the hearing on the motion to sell since the
proper time to litigate the issue of ownership over the aircraft is during the
trial proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the outset, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> was not trying to determine ownership of the
aircraft but merely required <u>prima facie</u> evidence that it is ill-gotten
wealth, precisely because the only evidence presented before it by the PCGG,
which is the Certificate of Registration, did not sufficiently establish that
the aircraft was owned, directly or indirectly, by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would have been improbable at
that time for the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> to accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on its face, the Solicitor General's
representation that the aircraft is ill-gotten on the basis of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> lone evidence, without delving further into the
actual relationship between the registered owner and Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span>, Jr., which thus led to the denial of the motion
to sell.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this score, our attention has been invited by Presiding
Justice <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span> to the fact that this is already
the third time that the PCGG chose to disclose certain factual matters and
evidence involved in a case in the . <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
distressingly only for 'the first time before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, we digress to strictly enjoin
the Office of the Solicitor General which represents the PCGG to scrupulously
prevent and avoid such a procedure which cannot but unnecessarily produce an
impasse, as in the case at bar, with the caveat that a repetition thereof will
not be tolerated by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the belated revelations by PCGG before the Court of
the alleged <u>prima facie</u> evidentiary support to warrant the sequestration
of the aircraft evidently cannot <span class="SpellE">subserve</span> the purpose
of its present petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We need not
belabor the rule that this Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of
facts and is not in a position to pass upon the merits of <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span>
present submissions based on unauthenticated and <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, these matter should
have been adduced in the first instance before the proper forum, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, especially considering that said court
precisely called for such evidence and the crux of its assailed resolution
rested on the existence <span class="SpellE">velinon</span> of said evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor does the <span class="SpellE">supervention</span> of the sale of
the airplane on September 28, 1989, during and despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case before the Court, completely render academic the proceedings
herein as to leave us no alternative but to yield our. imprimatur to a <u>fait
accompli</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the preceding
discussion of the cases hereinbefore cited and the contending submissions of
the parties in the present recourse, we cannot but make the observation that
the decision to sell the aircraft is not within the limited administrative
powers of the PCGG but requires the sanction of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
which can grant or withhold the same in the exercise of sound discretion and on
the basis of the evidence before it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without such approval by the judicial authority concerned, and no abuse
of discretion on its part having been established, it irresistibly follows that
any sale of said aircraft under the circumstances obtaining in this case would
constitute a prohibited and invalid disposition by the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also to put things in the proper perspective, it must be
emphasized that our issuance of the temporary restraining order of <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1989</st1:date> did not in any way
authorize PCGG to sell the aircraft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was only to prevent the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> from taking
further actions proceeding upon or pursuant to its assumption that the airplane
has been unlawfully sequestered and should not be in the custody of the PCGG since
that was the bone of contention to be resolved at that posture of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>PCGG could not have been unaware
that, as held in the BASECO and REPUBLIC cases, a definite and positive order
of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> authorizing the sale of the
aircraft is required.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE</b>, the
petition at bar is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Presidential Commission on Good Government is hereby ordered to deposit the
proceeds of the sale of the subject aircraft under a special time deposit with
the Philippine National Bank for the account of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in escrow for the person or persons natural or juridical, who may be adjudged
lawfully entitled thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor
General is also ordered to submit to this Court, within ten (10) days from
notice hereof, certified true copies of the bill of sale and all other
pertinent documents regarding the sale of said aircraft to Walter Fuller
Aircraft. Inc.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:</span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the Court's decision written with perspicuity by my distinguished
colleague, Justice Florenz D. Regalado.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court declares
clearly in this decision that in the absence of a court order, the PCGG has no
authority to sell sequestered property.  The PCGG is not the owner </span>of <span style="">the property it sequesters.  It
is only </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">overseer, a protector and preserver.  Its powers involve only </span>administration,
not ownership.  The sale of a
sequestered asset is not within the limited administrative powers vested in the
PCGG.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above rules are clear
and simple.  They were l</span><span style="">aid </span>down as early as <u>BASECO</u> <u>v.</u>
<u><span style="">PCGG</span></u><span style="">, (150 SCRA 181 [1987]).  I cannot understand why PCGG shoul</span>d<span style=""> </span>be <span style="">so </span>interested and so fast in selling the Falcon <span style="">jet </span>inspite of the clear ruling against
the exercise of acts of ownership by PCGG expressed in <u><span style="">BASECO</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There are other strange
circumstances of this case.  I find it
odd why the Republic should file suit against the Sandiganbayan alone without
impleading any private respondent.  Neither the registered owner Faysound Limited, the lessee UNICHEM, or
the suspected owner Mr. </span>Eduardo Cojuangco was impleaded and given a
chance to defend its or his interests.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The PCGG claims that the
ownership of the plane by Faysound Ltd. and its lease to UNICHEM are parts of a
</span>charade because the real owner of both corporations is <span style="">Mr. </span><span style="">Cojuangco.  PCGG is, therefore,
piercing the corporate veils of the two corporations </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">reaching out to the alleged owner without impleading the two
corporations.  It is assuming powers </span><span style="">which </span><span style="">even a court cannot exercise.  It is an elementary principle in Corporation Law that the corporate veil
cannot be </span><span style="">pierced </span><span style="">and the supposed owner held liable unless the
corporation itself is first impleaded.  Faysound Ltd. is not a respondent in this case and, as far as I can
gather, is not a defendant before the Sandiganbayan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I also wish to stress a
point </span><span style="">e</span><span style="">xpressed in the Court's decision which I feel
deserves emphasis.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our temporary restraining
order lifting the Sandiganbayan restraining order did not, by any stretch of
the imagination, authorize PCGG to sell the Falcon </span>aircraft.  <span style="">A <u>definite</u>
<u>and</u> <u>positive</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>order</u>
<span style="">of </span>a court is needed before the
jet plane may be sold.  The proper <span style="">procedure after the </span><span style="">lifting </span><span style="">of the restraining order was </span>for PCGG to go to Sandiganbayan and
ask for <u><span style="">formal</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>authority</u> to sell the
aircraft.  It should have<span style=""> presented there the documents which J</span><span style="">ustice </span><span style="">Regalado points out were deliberately withheld from Sandiganbayan</span>
b<span style="">ut </span>presented to the Supreme
Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alleged deteriorating
condition </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the airplane is no justification.  As conservator and protector, the PCGG had
the duty to store the plane in a safe place </span>and repair any deteriorating
parts, not to sell it.  If PC<span style="">GG has </span>no competence to preserve
sequestered property, it should return the same to the titled owner and ask the
court to fix a bond to answer for its value.  Instead of relishing the privileges of an owner such as selling valuable
properties or entering into controversial contracts, the PCGG should stay
within its powers as <span style="">an </span>overseer.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, reiterate my concurrence in <u><span style="">BASECO</span></u><span style=""> <u>v.</u> <u>  PCGG</u> </span>(<u>supra</u>)
and my dissent in <u>PCGG</u> <u>v</u><u><span style="">.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Peña</u> <span style="">(159 SCRA 556, </span>589 [1988]) where I emphasized how the PCGG has
strained and broken beyond the already ample and generous powers bestowed <span style="">on </span>it by <span style="">law.  </span>My separate opinions
<span style="">in </span>those two cases are squarely
applicable to this unauthorized and, therefore, void sale of the Falcon
aircraft.</p>
