<p class="BODY">Judge Gregorio Pineda of the former Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, in Adm. Matter No. 2076-Ret., was granted retirement

service, he claims that his accumulated vacation leave of 395-1/2 days and sick

the retirement age of 60.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Judge <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Montesclaros</span> of the Municipal Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City in Administrative Matter No. 5794-Ret., was
granted gratuity retirement benefits under Rep. Act No. 1616 effective February

or in any other branch of the government, or in both, have to "resign by
reason of their incapacity to discharge the duties of their office." In
his case, Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico's</span> service in the
judiciary was terminated on <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="7">July 31,

now claims that his case falls under the same class as Justice <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was 56
years, 10 months and 19 days old with 20 years, 6 months and 19 days of
government service.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Judge Nicolas A. <span class="SpellE">Gerochi</span> of the RTC, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Makati</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> in Administrative Matter No. 5621-Ret.,
appeals to us for the conversion of his approved application for gratuity

effective </span><st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November 4, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
application for gratuity benefits </span><span style="">was
</span><span style="">approved only after the resolution
by this Court of the administrative case filed against him together with other
judges for erroneous imposition of penalties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Adm. Matter No. 226, January </span><span style="">20, </span><span style="">1987) At the time of
his resignation, <span class="SpellE">Gerochi</span> was 55 years, 7 months and 2
days old with 29 years, 4 months and 24 days of government service, the last 11
years and 19 days of </span>which were continuously rendered in the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 1, paragraph (c)
of Republic Act No. 1616 gives the following benefits to a retiring judge or
justice:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Retirement is
likewise allowed to a member, regardless of age, who has rendered at least
twenty years of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The benefit
shall, in addition to the return of his personal contributions plus interest,
be only a gratuity equivalent to one month salary for every year of service,
based on the highest rate received, not to exceed twenty four months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This gratuity is payable by the employer or
office concerned which is hereby authorized to provide the necessary appropriation
or pay the same from savings in its appropriations.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Pres. Decree No. 1146 (the Revised Government Service
Insurance Act of 1977), under the provisions of which one of the petitioners
herein, Judge <span class="SpellE">Montecillo</span>, was allowed to receive
retirement benefits after his second resignation from government service,
provides that an old-age pension shall be paid to a member who has at least
fifteen (15) years of service, is at least sixty (60) years of age, and is
separated from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 11,
Pres. Decree No. 1146) Section 12 (a) states that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>Old</u> <u>Age</u> <u><span style="">Pension</span></u><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""> - (a) </span>A member entitled to old-age
pension shall receive the basic monthly pension for life but in no case a
period less than five years; Provided, - That, the member shall have the option
to convert the basic monthly salary pensions for the first five years into a
lump sum as defined in this Act; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The basic monthly pension is equal to a certain percentage, i.e.
37-1/2% of the revalued average monthly compensation, plus 2-1/2% of the
revalued average monthly compensation for each year of service in excess of
fifteen years, but the basic monthly pension shall not exceed 90% of the
average monthly compensation. (Section 9, Pres. Decree No. 1146)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners-judges now want to be entitled to retirement
benefits under Rep. Act No. 910, where each of them would receive:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) a lump sum of five [5] years gratuity
computed on the basis of the highest <span style="">monthly
salary plus the highest monthly aggregate of transportation, living and
representation allowances he was receiving on the date of his retirement; and
(b) thereafter upon survival after the expiration of the five-year period, to a
further lifetime annuity payable monthly equivalent to the amount of the
monthly salary he was receiving on the date of his retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section </span><span style="">3, </span><span style="">Rep. Act No. 910)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, petitioners would
receive higher benefits should their retirement be governed by Rep. Act. <span class="GramE">No. 910, as amended.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, a close </span><span style="">scrutiny
into </span><span style="">the service record as well
as the conduct of each of the judges is necessary to determine whether or not
the benefits under Rep. Act. No. 910, as amended shall be extended to them in
lieu of those approved under Rep. Act No. 1616 or Pres. Decree No. 1146.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The rule is that
retirement laws are construed liberally in favor of the retiring employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when in the interest of liberal
construction the Court allows seeming exceptions to fixed rules for certain
retired Judges or Justices, there are ample reasons behind each grant of an
exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crediting of accumulated
leaves to make up for lack of required age or length of service is not done
indiscriminately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is always on a case
to case basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In some instances, the
lacking element -- such as the time to reach an age limit or comply with length
of service -- is <u>de</u> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>minimis</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It
could be that the amount of accumulated leave credits is tremendous in
comparison to the lacking period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">More important, there
must be present an essential factor before an application under the <span class="SpellE"><u>Plana</u></span> or <span class="SpellE"><u>Britanico</u></span>
rulings may be granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court allows
a making up or compensating for lack of required age or service only if
satisfied that the career of the retiree was marked by competence, integrity,
and dedication to the public service; it was only a bowing to policy
considerations and an acceptance of the realities of political will which
brought him or her to premature retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Where a Judge resigns to
avoid the messy embarrassments of an investigation of poor performance </span>or
alleged anomalies or while never having been <span style="">disciplined for want of civic-minded witnesses, his record is
nonetheless marred by notoriety or scandal, or where a superior court was
constrained to move fast in order to reverse or undo his rash orders and
suspicious indiscretions, obviously neither the <span class="SpellE"><u>Plana</u></span>
nor <span class="SpellE"><u>Britanico</u></span> rulings will apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are other instances when a Judge must
content himself with the retirement benefits under less generous
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For those who were retired
pursuant to the 1983 reorganization, similar </span>considerations are taken
into account.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should be noted that
the reorganization of the judiciary in 1983 was declared valid by this Court in
<u>De</u> <u>La</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Llana</u></span> <u>v</u>. <u>Alba</u>
(112 SCRA 294 [1982]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
non-reappointment of certain Judges as a result of the reorganization was the
result of careful deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Executive Order No. 611 created a Presidential Committee on Judicial
Reorganization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A committee to screen
the records of Judges to be appointed or reappointed was constituted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court in <u>De</u> <u>La</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Llana</u></span>
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"They ignore the categorical language of this provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court shall submit to the
President, within thirty (30) days from the date of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this act, a staffing pattern for all courts constituted pursuant to this Act
which shall be the basis of the implementing order to be issued by the
President in accordance, with the immediately succeeding section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, Section 43) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
meanwhile, the existing inferior courts affected continue functioning as
before, ‘until the completion of the reorganization provided in this Act as
declared by the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such
declaration, the said courts shall be deemed automatically abolished and the
incumbents thereof shall cease to hold office.’ (Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, Section 44) There is no ambiguity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incumbents of the courts thus
automatically abolished ‘shall cease to hold office.’ No fear need be
entertained by incumbents whose length of service, quality of performance, and
clean record justify their being named anew, (This Court is ready with such a
list to be furnished the President) in legal contemplation without any
interruption in the continuity of their service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In the language of par. XI of the Proposed
Guidelines for Judicial Reorganization:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>‘<span class="GramE">The</span> services of those not separated shall be
deemed uninterrupted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such cases,
efficiency, integrity, length of service and other relevant factors shall be
considered.’) It is equally reasonable to assume that from the ranks of
lawyers, either in the government service, private practice, or law professors
will <span class="GramE">come</span> the new appointees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> <span style="">(<span class="GramE">id</span>. </span>at pp. 335-337)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court explained in the decision's footnotes that it "is
ready with such a list (of Judges recommended for re-appointment) to be
furnished the President." <span class="GramE">(Footnote No. 97 at p. 336).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also added the relevant factors to be
considered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Court did not include
a Judge in its list <span style="">or </span>if the
President did <span style="">not appoint a Judge
included in the list of the Court, it is an indication that the relevant
factors were considered and the Judge was found wanting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has carefully gone over the history of the petitioners/<span class="SpellE">movants</span> in these cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of one or more of the reasons given above, it finds them
not entitled to unqualifiedly avail of the privileges given under the <span class="SpellE"><u>Plana</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Britanico</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>rulings.</p>
