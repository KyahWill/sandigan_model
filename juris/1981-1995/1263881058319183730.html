former counsel of the University of the East Faculty Association (UEFA), to be
assessed against petitioner University of the East (UE) despite the fact that
the compromise agreement presented by the parties to end their pending labor
cases and approved by the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) does not
provide for attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1974</st1:date>
Presidential Decree No. 451 (authorizing the Secretary of Education and Culture
to regulate the Imposition of Tuition and Other School Fees, Repealing Republic
Act No. 6139, and For Other Purposes) was promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 (a) of the Decree provides that
sixty per centum (60%) of the proceeds from tuition fee increases (incremental
proceeds) shall be allocated for increase in salaries and wages of faculty
members and school personnel of colleges and universities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1986</st1:date>,
the UEFA through <span style="">its </span>counsel
respondent <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>
filed a complaint with the Ministry (now Department) of Labor and Employment
for the payment of their share of the tuition fee increases collected by
petitioner UE for the school years 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 pursuant to P.D.
No. 451 with damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
referred to respondent Director Luna C. <span class="SpellE">Piezas</span> of <span style="">the National Capital </span>Region, DOLE.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing a position paper as required by the Regional
Office after efforts at amicable settlement failed, UE filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground that the Regional Director did not have jurisdiction over the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>UE claimed that since this is a
money claim arising from employer-employee relationship, it falls within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiter, pursuant to paragraph 2, Article
217 of the Labor Code, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1987</st1:date>,
Director Luna C. <span class="SpellE">Piezas</span> issued an order denying the
motion to dismiss and ruled in favor of the UEFA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the Order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSOLIDATED, Order of compliance is
hereby issued directing the respondent U.E. to pay its covered teachers the
amount of TWENTY FOUR MILLION FOUR HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIX
PESOS and 65/100 (P24,409,306.65) representing complainant's share out of sixty
(60%) percent incremental proceeds from tuition fee increase covering school
years 1983-1984; 1984-1985; 1985-1986; and first semester 1986-1987, without
prejudice of deducting whatever advances granted to individual faculty members
representing said increase, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of this
Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is further directed to
hold in trust ten (10%) percent attorney's fees deductible from each faculty
member." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 126)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed the Order to the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner UE reiterated its position that the Regional Director
did not have jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>UE alleged that the Director ordered awards for UEFA without considering
<span class="SpellE">UE's</span> records and documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, UEFA assailed the Order for its failure to
grant the complainant's claim for legal interest, damages, and attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>UEFA contended that the undue
delay in the payment of its share to the tuition fee increases entitled UEFA to
damages from UE and that under the Labor Code the unlawful withholding of wages
entitles UEFA to an award of 10% attorney's fees from UE.</p>

of 1986-1987 should include all allowances and benefits granted the faculty
members during these periods;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE SECRETARY AND UNDERSECRETARY <span style="">OF </span>LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT COMMITTED GRAVE
ABUSE OF DISCRETION <span style="">TANTAMOUNT TO LACK
OF </span>JURISDICTION IN ORDERING THE UNIVERSITY OF THE EAST TO PAY ATTORNEY'S
FEES INSPITE OF THE FACT <span style="">THAT </span>THE
PARTIES <span style="">HAVE </span>ALREADY ENTERED INTO
A COMPROMISE AGREEMENT WHICH DID NOT SANCTION OR STIPULATE SUCH FEES.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="">I</span>I</p>

UEFA SHOULD BE HELD LIABLE THEREFOR." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 11-12)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The well-established doctrine is that compromise agreements
executed by workers or employees and their employers to settle their
differences if done in good faith are valid and binding among the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Dionela</span>
v. Court of Industrial Relations, 8 SCRA 832 [1963]; <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>

[1982]; Chua v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al., 190 SCRA 558 <span style="">[1990]).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In the instant case
there is no dispute about the validity of the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is whether or not the Secretary
of Labor has the authority to award attorney's fees in favor of respondent
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>, the former counsel of UEFA, charged
against UE despite the fact that the compromise agreement of the parties is
silent on the matter of attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner states that all matters relative to the dispute of
the parties which were not specifically covered by the compromise agreement
including the matter <span style="">of </span>attorney's
fees were deemed waived and/or became moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the petitioner contends that the <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1988</st1:date> order which awarded
attorney's fees in favor of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> and assessed
against the petitioner is deemed waived and unenforceable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contention is on the premise that
"neither the Court nor quasi-judicial bodies can impose upon the parties a
judgment different from their compromise agreement (which as a valid contract
is the law between the parties themselves) or against the very terms and
conditions <span style="">of </span>their agreement."
<span class="GramE">(Philippine Bank of Communications v. <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>,
99 SCRA 508 [1980]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
petitioner asserts that the Secretary of Labor committed grave abuse of
discretion when he awarded attorney's fees in favor of <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>
based on Article 111 (a) of the Labor Code which provides that "In cases
of unlawful withholding of wages the culpable party may be assessed attorney's
fees equivalent to ten percent of the amount of wages recovered." Besides,
according to the petitioner, the parties in their compromise agreement agreed
that the petitioner was not guilty of unlawfully withholding the respondent's
employees’ wages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their only dispute was
on the computation of wages due the employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that the terms and conditions set forth in the
compromise agreement and approved by the court are controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(World Machine Enterprises v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, G.R. No. 72019, December 20, 1990, 192 SCRA 459 [1990])</p>

dated <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1987</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1988</st1:date>, <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1988</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1989</st1:date> had all become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the new counsel of UEFA entered into a new round
of negotiations with UE leading to a compromise agreement where any mention of
attorney's fees was omitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The compromise agreement was referred to DOLE and approved by
that office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the order
now questioned by UE awarded 10% of the amount agreed upon in the compromise
agreement to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> for his attorney's <span style="">fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that "neither the Court nor quasi-judicial
bodies can impose upon the parties a judgment different from their compromise
agreement (which as a valid contract is the law between the parties themselves)
or against the very terms and conditions of their agreement" (Philippine
Bank of Communications v. <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>, <u>supra</u>)
may have some merit if respondent <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> had remained
as counsel of UEFA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was no longer
the lawyer of the teachers' union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> having already
won the cases and the awards in his favor <span style="">having
</span>become final, the new lawyer and the officers of UEFA entered into an
agreement stripping <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> of what had been awarded to
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Basic considerations of fairness
and justice dictate that blind conformity to the rule regarding compromise
agreements should not apply here.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> was not
a party to the compromise agreement and could not be bound by terms which
removed the awards earlier given to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only matters which could be compromised were between UE and UEFA and
the latter's new counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A compromise
agreement is a contract and, therefore, cannot affect third persons who are not
parties to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Tongol</span>, 16 SCRA

<blockquote>"It must be made clear that the compromise agreement entered
by and between respondent and complainants should not work to deprive Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> of his just entitlement to attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As cited <span style="">in </span>the assailed Order, the Supreme Court, <span style="">in </span>the case of National Power
Corporation v. NPC Employees and Workers Association, 89 SCRA 1), ruled that
the withdrawal of a labor case by agreement of the parties should not result in
the deprivation of a former union counsel of reasonable fees for his services.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While indeed there is no attorney-client relationship between
respondent and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>, and the compromise
agreement provides that it was entered into <span class="SpellE"><u>nolo</u></span>

liability, still this Office could not close its eyes to the fact that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> has actually been awarded attorney's fees in our
Order of August 17, 1989." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 53-54)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> that his

had already vested when the orders awarding those fees became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any

<blockquote>“In cases of unlawful withholding of wages, the culpable party may
be assessed attorney’s fees equivalent to ten percent of the amount of wages
recovered.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the ruling of DOLE on the ground that
the compromise agreement exonerates the petitioner of any culpability in the
non-release of the employees’ share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
earlier pointed out, the agreement states that UE pays P3.5 million and agrees
not to collect advances amounting to P6.5 million <u>without</u> <u>these</u> <u>payments</u>

<p class="BODY">As between UE and UEFA, the disclaimer of liability or
culpability is binding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1989</st1:date> compromise
agreement could not undo the evidence of culpability insofar as the claims of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span>, a non-party to the agreement, are
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the UEFA through counsel <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> filed complaints against UE for non-payment of the

1986 and 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent agreed with the contentions of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> when it ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, even without the express grant of an award for
attorney's fees and even absent a clear delineation as to who is liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> (by reason of the intervention of the compromise
agreement), this Office cannot be blind to the fact that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> successfully handled the afore-titled cases until
their resolution - albeit not final on two of the three cases at bar -- and
that there was an initial finding of the culpability on the part of the
respondent (petitioner) by the Regional Director a quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, justice demands that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fojas</span> should not be denied of his attorney's fees as
compensation for his labors and that the same <span class="GramE">be</span>
assessed against respondent University of the East pursuant to Article III (a)
of the Labor Code, which provides that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The above quoted Article III (a) of the Labor Code is under Book
Three (entitled Conditions of Employment) of the Labor Code and is, thus,
within the coverage of labor standards which the Secretary of Labor and
Employment is empowered by law to administer and enforce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a device for the disorderly
dispensation of justice if a party who seeks the enforcement of a labor
standard law should be made to resort to the regular courts just to claim for
payment of attorney's fees, while pleading before the Secretary for other
remedies arising from the same cause of action." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 54-55)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Law </span>and equity
