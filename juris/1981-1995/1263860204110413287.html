Corporation (PISC) leased from the plaintiff and its wholly owned subsidiary,
the Container Trading Corporation, several containers pursuant to the

<blockquote>In 1979 to 1981, defendant Philippine International Shipping
Corporation incurred outstanding and unpaid obligations with the plaintiff, in
the amount of $94,456.28, representing unpaid per diems, drop-off charges,
interest and other agreed charges.</blockquote>

demanding payment of their outstanding and unpaid obligations, but to no avail,
so plaintiff was constrained to file a case against the principal defendant,
PISC, before the United States District Court, Southern District of New York,
which was docketed as 83 Civil 290 (EW).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff obtained a Default <span class="SpellE">Judgement</span> on July
3, 1983 against PISC ordering it to pay the plaintiff the sum of $80,779.33, as
liquidated damages, together with interest in the amount of $13.676.95 and
costs in the amount of $80.00 or for a total judgment of $94,456.28 (Exhibit A).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Because of the unjustifiable failure and refusal of PISC and its
guarantors to jointly and severally pay their obligations to the plaintiff, the
latter filed on <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1983</st1:date>

defendant PISC, and also to enforce the individually executed Continuing
Guaranties of the other defendants (Annexes D, E, G, H, I and J of the Complaint).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendants (herein petitioners) were duly summoned, but they
failed to answer the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for Review, filed with this Court on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="2">27 February 1987</st1:date>, petitioners allege
that both the Default Judgment rendered by the U.S. District Court, Southern
District of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">New </span>York, in 83 Civil
290 (EW), and the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, in Civil Case No. Q-39927, are null and void essentially on
jurisdictional grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first
instance, petitioners contend that the U.S. District Court never acquired
jurisdiction over their persons as they had not been served with summons and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>copy of the Complaint in 83 Civil 290
(EW).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the second instance,
petitioners contend that such jurisdictional infirmity effectively prevented
the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City from taking
cognizance of the Complaint in Civil Case No. Q-39927 and from enforcing the
U.S. District Court's Default Judgment against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners contend, finally, that assuming
the validity of the disputed Default Judgment, the same may be enforced only
against petitioner Philippine International Shipping Corporation
("PISC"), the other nine (9) petitioners not having been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> originally in the case filed in <st1:place><st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">New </span>York</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>U.S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place></p>

<p class="BODY">The Petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the
evidence of record clearly shows that the U.S. District Court had validly
acquired jurisdiction over petitioner PISC under the procedural law applicable
in that forum, i.e., the U.S. Federal Rules on Civil Procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the Summons and Complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
in 83 Civil 290 (EW) which were in fact attached to the Petition for Review
filed with this Court, were stamped "<u>Received, 18 Jan 1983, P.I.S.C.,
Manila</u>." indicating that service thereof had been made upon and
acknowledged by the PISC office in Manila on, 18 January 1983, and that PISC
had <u>actual notice</u> of such Complaint and Summons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, copies of said Summons and Complaint
had likewise been served upon Prentice-Hall Corporation System, Inc. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">(New </span>York), petitioner PISC'S agent,
expressly designated by it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the
Master Equipment Leasing Agreement with respondent <span class="SpellE">Interpool</span>,
"for the purpose of accepting service of any process within the State of
New York, USA with respect to any claim or controversy arising out of or
relating to, directly or indirectly, this Lease."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The record also shows that petitioner PISC, without, however, assailing the
jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court over the person of petitioner, had
filed a Motion to Dismiss<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the Complaint in 83 Civil 290 (EW), which Motion was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of the foregoing matters, which were
stated specifically in the U.S. District Court's disputed Default Judgment,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
have not been <span class="SpellE">disproven</span> or otherwise overcome by
petitioners, whose bare and unsubstantiated allegations cannot prevail over
clear and convincing evidence of record to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">That foreign judgment -- which had become <u>final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span></u>, no appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and perfected by petitioner PISC -- is thus
"presumptive evidence of a right as between the parties [i.e., PISC and <span class="SpellE">Interpool</span>] and their successors in interest by a subsequent
title."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
We note, further, that there has been in this case no showing by petitioners
that the Default Judgment rendered by the U.S. District Court in 83 Civil 290
(EW), was vitiated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by "want </span>of
notice to the party, collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, the Default Judgment imposing upon petitioner PISC a liability
of U.S.$94,456.28 in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Interpool</span>,
is valid and may be enforced in this jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The existence of
liability (i.e., in the amount of U.S.$94,456.28) on the part of petitioner
PISC having been duly established in the U.S. case, it was not improper for
respondent <span class="SpellE">Interpool</span>, in seeking enforcement in this
jurisdiction of the foreign judgment imposing such liability to have included
the other nine (9) petitioners herein (i.e., George Lim, Marcos Bautista,
Carlos Laude, Tan Sing Lim, Antonio Liu Lao, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Teh</span>, Philippine Consortium Construction Corporation,
Pacific Mills, Inc. and Universal Steel Smelting Co., Inc.) as defendants in
Civil Case No. Q-39927, filed with Branch 93 of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With

award of U.S.$94,456.28 is precisely premised upon a breach by PISC of its own

therefore, consider the nine (9) other petitioners as persons "against

summons in Civil Case No. Q-39927, does not persuade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But we do not need to address this specific
argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For even assuming (though
merely <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>) that none of the ten (10)
petitioners herein had been served with notice or summons below, the record
shows, however, that they did in fact file with the Regional Trial Court a
Motion for Extension of Time to File Answer<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>

those pleadings, petitioners not only manifested their intention to controvert
the allegations in the Complaint, but they neither questioned nor assailed the
jurisdiction of the trial court, either over the case filed against them or
over their individual persons, as defendants therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was here, in effect, voluntary submission
to the jurisdiction of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
