				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">On the night of 19
January 1978, members of the Dagupan Police Force, acting on a verbal report,
arrived at the </span><span style="">store </span><span style="">of one Natalia Claveria and found the
prostrate body of Rodolfo Meneses, his intestines protruding.  His death, </span><span style="">caused by acute hemorrhage from a gaping stab wound in the abdomen,
5-1/2 by 1-1/4 inches, was attributed to accused-appellant GREGORIO PASTORAL, </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">was subsequently convicted of murder by the Circuit Criminal Court of
Dagupan City on 15 June 1979</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and sentenced to </span><i style=""><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style=""> as well </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">to indemnify the heirs of Meneses in the amount of P12,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts presented by
the prosecution, and adopted by the trial court, are substantially as
follows:  At about 9:00 o'clock in the
evening of 19 January 1978, Jaime Callanta, Bonifacio Lagman, Rudy Soriano and
the deceased Rodolfo Meneses were seated, in that order, at the counter of
Natalia Claveria's store conversing.  About ten minutes later, accused Pastoral appeared and talked briefly to
</span>Callanta and Lagman, warning them not to meddle ("walang makikialam").  Then, heading straight to where Meneses was
seated, Pastoral who <span style="">was </span>concealing a knife, suddenly lunged at him but missed.  As Meneses fell inside the store, the
accused pursued him by jumping over the counter.  Rising, Meneses lifted a bench nearby and with it warded off the
second attack of the accused.  The
effort proved futile as the assailant succeeded in wounding Meneses in the
stomach, which turned <span style="">out </span>to be
fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this appeal, the
accused contends that the trial court erred in convicting him of murder, and
without any mitigating circumstance, and in not </span><span style="">acquitting him on reasonable doubt.  He avers that of the eleven </span><span style="">(11)
</span><span style="">prosecution witnesses presented,
only one pointed to him as the knifewielder.  That witness was Bonifacio Lagman, whose credibility is suspect.  Aside from being biased, his testimony was
saturated with vague, </span><span style="">incoherent
and contradictory statements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">First.  While Lagman stated on direct examination
that Meneses tried to defend himself with a "chair",</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> on cross-examination he said that it was
actually a "bench" or "banco"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> that Meneses used.  But that apparent discrepancy was adequately explained during the
trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "Banco" is the local term for the
particular long chair used by the deceased.  Hence, when Lagman mentioned "banco" during cross-examination
instead of the word "chair" which he used in his direct-examination,
he was not contradicting himself as he was only calling that particular chair
by its more popular name in the locality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second.  The accused points out that Lagman had
doubts as to the exact "seating arrangement" of </span>Meneses and
his three (3) <span style="">companions </span>at the
store <span style="">counter right before the killing,
and that the witness was also uncertain whether Meneses grabbed the chair
before or after the accused leaped over the counter to stab his
"quarry" again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Such inconsistencies are
inconsequential.  A certain latitude
must be given to whatever minor mistakes the witness might have said about the
actual confrontation.  For </span>apart
from the shock and numbing effect of the whole incident, the rapidity with
which <span style="">the sequence of events took place
must have taken its toll on the accuracy of the ‘witness’ account.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Third.  The accused also
argues that whatever residue of credibility is left of Lagman's testimony has
been shattered by the "crowning" contradiction found between his
sworn statement before the Office of the Investigation Section of the Dagupan
Police Station<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and his oral testimony in court.  Specifically, the sworn statement narrates that Lagman suddenly
"saw Rodolfo Meneses entered (sic) the x x x store followed by Gregorio
Pastoral x x x with a bladed weapon in his right hand then attacked and stab
(sic) Rodolfo Meneses but luckily this Rodolfo Meneses was able to grab a
wooden stall (chair) and use the same in defending himself.  But then x x x Gregorio Pastoral x x x made
another thrust of the weapon in his hand and Rodolfo Meneses was hit on his
stomach and as a result he fell to the cemented flooring of the store.  Then Gregorio Pastoral hurriedly went
outside the store still holding the fatal weapon in his hand and then faced
(Lagman) and Jaime Callanta and warn (sic) x x x both not to intervene then
fled away."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Lagman testified in court that it was <u>before</u>
proceeding to where Meneses was seated that the accused made the warning; that
the accused initially attempted to stab Meneses, albeit unsuccessfully, while
the latter was still seated on the store counter;<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> that
after succeeding in his purpose, accused just walked away from the store and headed
towards the east.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contradiction between Exh. "1" and the oral
testimony is not fatal.  Apart from the
fact that Exh. "1" was read to Lagman at 4:00 o'clock in the morning
following the incident, at <span style="">a </span>time
when he was understandably feeling tired and sleepy, the rule <span style="">is </span>that in
case of inconsistencies between the affidavit and the court testimony, the
latter is to be given more weight.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> Taken
<i style=""><span style="">ex
parte</span></i><span style=""> </span>and commonly prepared by someone other than the affiant
himself, affidavits are usually incomplete and partially inaccurate due to
suggestions or want of suggestions and inquiries which may be necessary for the
accurate recollection of all relevant matters.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">In fact, </span>the infirmity of affidavits
as a specie of evidence <span style="">is </span>much a matter of judicial experience, for which reason, it
has been held that variances between affidavit and court testimony do not by
themselves affect credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourth.  The accused
concludes that being a neighbor and friend of Meneses, Lagman was partial for
Meneses.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">This, undoubtedly is </span><i style="">non sequitur</i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">Well settled is the rule that mere
relationship of the victim to a witness does not </span>automatically impair
his credibility as to render his testimony less worthy of credence where no
improper motive can be ascribed to him for testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Consequently, we </span>give credence
to the testimony of witness Lagman that appellant stabbed the victim to death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused Pastoral claims
that Meneses was the initial aggressor.  He recounted that he just went to the store of Natalia Claveria to buy
brewed rice.  While there, Meneses with
three (3) companions offered him a drink, which he refused.  Feeling slighted, Meneses pushed the glass
towards his (accused) mouth but he shoved it aside, spilling the contents on
Meneses' chest.  Meneses then threw the
glass at the accused but missed him.  To
avert a </span>fight, <span style="">he embraced
Meneses and they both fell over the counter and into the store.  Meneses stood up and brandished a
"balisong" prompting him to grab a bench to shield himself from the
assault.  The initial thrust by Meneses
missed the accused but the chair he was holding fell from his hands when the
former attempted to stab him the second time.  However, he was able to grab the left hand of </span>the <span style="">deceased that was holding the
"balisong".  They grappled for
its possession, but as they fell on the cement floor the knife pierced the
stomach of Meneses causing his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defense witness Alfredo
Bengson, claiming to be in conversation with Oling Biala some four (4) meters away,
corroborated the story of Pastoral.  He
testified that on his way to Claveria's store,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the accused walked past him, and even
greeted him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Several reasons impel us<span style=""> </span>to
discard Bengson's testimony, as the court <i style="">a
quo</i><span style=""> </span>did.  It strains the imagination how Bengson could
have seen Pastoral and Meneses fall, with the former on<span style=""> </span>top of the latter, considering that he was some four (4) meters
away on the opposite side of the road<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">with a store counter blocking his view.  Biala himself denied having seen anybody or
witnessed anything in the course of his conversation </span>with <span style="">Bengson.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Absent a credible corroborating testimony, we cannot accept the
self-serving assertion of Pastoral that it was Meneses who was the aggressor
and that the killing was accidental.  Aside from Bengson, none of those present at the store testified for the
accused.  Natalia Claveria, Bonifacio
Lagman and Roberto Sanchez testified for the prosecution, while the victim's
two (2) companions, Rudy Soriano and Jaime Callanta, himself a distant relative
of Pastoral, could not even be summoned to appear in court.  Besides, while the accused claims innocence,
his actuations subsequent to the killing betray his guilt.  Under the circumstances, an innocent man
would have stayed and done <span style="">everything
possible to save the victim's life, especially when he sees the victim writhing
in pain from the stab wound he had inflicted.  But Pastoral did no such thing.  Instead, after "accidentally" wounding Meneses, Pastoral left
the scene, went home and headed straight for bed, with nary a word to his wife
about the tragic incident,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> apparently unconcerned that at that very
moment the man whom he calls “kuya”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> could have already breathed his last.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused contends that
the trial court erred in diregarding the mitigating circumstance of voluntary
surrender in his favor.  This is
untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pastoral testified that
after the killing, he went directly home and, without telling his wife that he
had accidentally stabbed Meneses, slept up to past</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">1:00
o'clock in the morning</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> when he was suddenly awakened by
"persons" informing him that Rodolfo Meneses was already dead.  He did not recognize those
"persons".  Afraid that the
victim's relatives would take revenge on him, he "stealthily" went to
his father's house,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> then to his father-in-law's place in
Calasiao.  After telling his relatives
about the stabbing incident, Pastoral made up his mind to surrender to the
authorities there.  However, on second
thought, he decided to surrender to the Dagupan Police instead.  He was actually on his way to Dagupan City
on board a jeepney when he saw Pat. Pablo Lazo and Pfc. Morante and yielded
himself to them</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The testimony of Pat.
Lazo ruled out voluntary surrender.  He
declared that </span><span style="">while </span><span style="">he and Pfc. Morante were stationed in front
of the Pangasinan Village Inn for the purpose of flagging down all passenger
jeepneys to find the accused, a passenger mini-bus heading towards Urdaneta
(located in the opposite direction of Dagupan) passed by at about 4:30 o'clock
in the morning of 20 January 1978.  Pat.
Lazo boarded said mini-bus and spotted the accused bending, with his head
bowed,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> apparently hiding himself from the police.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As between the testimony
of a police officer who enjoys the presumption of regularity in the performance
of his official duties and Pastoral's self-serving assertion, we are inclined
to accept the testimony of the officer as the </span>true account of the
alleged "surrender".  Besides,
as adverted to above, the actuations of Pastoral after the incident were
inconsistent with his innocence.  The
trial court, therefore, did not err when it convicted Pastoral without
appreciating the attenuating circumstance voluntary surrender.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Anent the trial court's
conclusion that the crime committed was murder, it should be noted that the
Information alleges treachery and evident premeditation.  But the trial court, while rejecting the
presence of treachery, considered against appellant the qualifying circumstance
of evident premeditation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that neither </span>c<span style="">ircumstance was conclusively established to
qualify the killing to murder.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to the
prosecution, Pastoral went to the house of Meneses sometime in July 1977 to ask
the latter not to testify against him in a theft case.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Meneses refused</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and went ahead with his testimony during the
hearing in the afternoon of 19 January 1978.  That evening, at Natalia Claveria’s store, the accused talked briefly </span><span style="">with </span><span style="">Jaime Callanta and Bonifacio Lagman, </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">were then seated
beside Meneses, and warned them not to intervene.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Then he walked towards Meneses and drew his
knife.  The first thrust missed its mark
but the second was fatal in spite of Meneses’ attempt to elude the blow.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The attendant
circumstances negate treachery.  There
is treachery only when the offender commits </span>any <span style="">of the crimes against persons, employing means, methods, or forms in
the </span>execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended
party might make.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, the killing was not
treacherous when the would-be killer attacked his victim in a public place in
front of the latter’s three (3) companions and the store owner, who could all
recount the startling occurrence and even lend support to the victim in the
prosecution of his assailant.  In addition,
the assault itself was not so sudden because when Pastoral arrived at the
store, he did not immediately head towards his prey but even found time to talk
briefly with Callanta and Lagman, warning them not to interfere.  It is not difficult to conclude then that
Meneses, </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">must have had an inkling that Pastoral was
not too happy about his (Meneses) adverse testimony in court earlier that
afternoon, had an opportunity to apprise himself of the presence of the accused
and brace himself up against any possible attack from the latter, in whatever
form it might </span>take.  The
opportunity proved itself useful, for the initial attempt of the accused to
stab Meneses failed, and that the latter even had time to defend himself
against the second assault, albeit unsuccessfully.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The court </span><i style=""><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">found that the accused committed the crime
with evident premeditation, drawing its conclusion from the testimonies of his
common-law wife Norma Basa, and Roberto Sanchez.  From Basa, the trial court deduced that Pastoral had earlier
threatened Meneses, and from Sanchez, that the accused had told him that he
would "kuan Elias.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span><span style="">finding </span><span style="">that Pastoral had previously threatened the deceased is not supported
by the records.  Norma Basa testified
that Pastoral went to their house in July 1977 and </span><u>asked</u> <span style="">her husband not to testify in the theft case
against Pastoral.  Contrary to the
finding of the trial court, Norma did not state that the accused threatened her
husband.  This </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">evident from her testimony -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.  Before the death of your common-law husband,
Rodolfo Meneses, was there any occasion when you saw the accused Gregorio
Pastoral, Jr. in your house?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir, last July.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of

<blockquote>"x  x  x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was

<blockquote>"A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
<span style="">sir"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Conspicuously absent is
any mention of supposed threats by the accused made on the person of the
deceased.  On the contrary, only the
words "ask" and "convince" were used.  Hence, the conclusion of the trial court
that the accused threatened Meneses sometime in July 1977 is clearly without
factual basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Roberto Sanchez, in turn,
testified on direct examination that he saw the accused twice on 19 January
1978, the first in the house of a certain Boy Castillo between 8:00 and 9:00
o'clock in the morning,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and once again at the railroad tracks just
before the stabbing incident.  Pastoral
was then armed with a knife and was walking fast towards the direction of
Claveria’s store.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, during the cross
examination six (6) days later, Sanchez testified that he actually saw the
accused thrice, i.e., in addition to the meeting at Boy Castillo’s house, he
met and talked with Pastoral at the railroad tracks at 10:00 o'clock in the
morning of 19 January 1978, and that after inquiring about the whereabouts of
Meneses, Pastoral told him that he would "kuan Elias".  Meneses was also known as "Elias"
in the neighborhood.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot, as the trial court did, consider the above testimony
of Sanchez as evidence of the time when the accused determined to commit the
crime.  The word "kuan" is
ambiguous and susceptible of various interpretations.  By itself, "kuan" cannot be construed to mean that the
accused had resolved to kill Meness prior to the moment of its execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">To authorize a finding of evident premeditation, it must affirmatively
appear from the overt acts of the accused that he definitely resolved to commit
the offense; that he coolly and dispassionately reflected both on the me<span style="">a</span>ns of carrying his resolution into
execution and on the consequences of his criminal design; and, that such an
appreciable length of time elapsed as to expect an aroused conscience to
otherwise relent and desist from the accomplishment of the intended crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although the facts tend
to show that accused Pastoral might have a reason to resent the deceased after
the latter had testified against him in the theft case notwithstanding a
request not to do so, there is no competent evidence to prove that the accused
resolved to take Meneses’ life.  As </span><span style="">previously discussed, that Pastoral had
earlier threatened the deceased is not borne out by the records.  Bearing in mind the well settled rule that
evident premeditation, like other circumstances that would qualify the killing
to murder, must be established by clear and positive evidence, mere
presumptions and inferences being insufficient no matter how logical and
probable they may be,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> we find that such circumstance cannot be
appreciated against the accused.  Indeed, it cannot be drawn from mere conclusions and inferences</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>for it must be evident and not merely
suspected.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
And whenever its existence has not been established beyond doubt, the accused
should be given the benefit of the doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution failed to
adduce direct and positive evidence that accused Pastoral did intend to kill
the deceased.  The word "kuan"
is too general and ambiguous a term to describe an intention to kill.  On the contrary, the actuations of the
accused immediately after the stabbing belie such intent.  He walked away from the scene of the crime
and slept until he was awakened and told that Meneses died.  It was then that he attempted to flee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, absent any circumstance qualifying the killing to
murder, the accused should be held liable only for homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty for homicide as prescribed in Art. 249 of the Revised
Penal Code is <i style="">reclusion temporal</i><span style=""> </span>the range of which is twelve (12)
years and one (1) day to twenty (20) years.  Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and in the absence of any
aggravating or mitigating circumstances, the maximum shall be taken from the
medium period of <i style="">reclusion temporal</i><span style="">, </span>which is fourteen (14) years, eight
(8) months and (1) day, to seventeen (17) years, and four (4) months, while the
minimum shall be taken from the penalty next lower in degree, which is <i style="">prision mayor</i><span style="">, </span>in any of its periods, the range of which is six (6) years and
one (1) day, to twelve (12) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ordered the payment of P12,000.00 for the death
of Rodolfo Meneses as civil indemnity.  In line with recent jurisprudence, however, the amount should be raised
to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the conviction of GREGORIO PASTORAL, JR. Y
TAMONDONG for murder is reduced to homicide.  Consequently, he is sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of eight
(8) years, four <span style="">(4) </span>months and one (1) day of <i style="">prision mayor</i><span style=""> medium, </span>as
minimum, to fourteen (14) years, ten (10) months and ten (10) days of <i style="">reclusion temporal</i><span style=""> medium, </span>as maximum.</p>
