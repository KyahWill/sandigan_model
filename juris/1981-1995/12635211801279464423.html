In a decision rendered on May 3, 1971 by the now defunct Court of First 
Instance of Rizal, Branch V, at Quezon City, in Civil Case No. Q-4689 
thereof, entitled "Jose Arañas, et al. <em>vs.</em> Juanito Castañeda, 
et al.," the said court declared that petitioner Luisa Quijencio as 
plaintiff (assisted by her spouse co-petitioner Jose Arañas) was the 
owner of 400 shares of stock of respondent Universal Textile Mills, Inc.
 (UTEX) as defendant issued "in the names of its co-defendants Gene 
Manuel and B.R. Castañeda, including the stock dividends that accrued to
 said shares, and ordering defendant Universal Textile Mills, Inc. to 
cancel said certificates and issue new ones in the name of said 
plaintiff Luisa Quijencio Arañas and to deliver to her all dividends 
appertaining to same, whether in cash or in stocks."
<p>
In a motion for clarification and/or motion for reconsideration, respondent UTEX manifested, <em>inter alia</em>,
 that "(I)f this Honorable Court by the phrase 'to deliver to her all 
dividends appertaining to same, whether in cash or in stocks,' meant 
dividends properly pertaining to plaintiffs <em>after</em> the court's declaration of plaintiffs' ownership of said 400 shares of stock, then as defendant UTEX has always maintained <em>it would rightfully abide</em>
 by whatever decision may be rendered by this Honorable Court since such
 would be the logical consequence after the declaration or ruling in 
respect to the rightful ownership of the said shares of stock." The 
motion for clarification was granted by the trial court which ruled that
 its judgment against UTEX was to pay to Luisa Quijencio Arañas the cash
 dividends which accrued to the stocks in question after the rendition 
of this decision <em>excluding </em>cash dividends already paid to its co-defendants Gene Manuel and B.R. Castañeda which <em>accrued before its decision</em> and could not be claimed by the petitioners-spouses, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "This in mind, clarification of the dispositive portion of the 
decision as aforequoted is indeed necessary, and thus made as to ordain 
the payment to plaintiff Luisa Quijencio Arañas of cash dividends which 
accrue to the stocks in question after the rendition of this decision.  
Cash dividends already paid to defendants which accrued before this 
decision may not, therefore, be claimed by plaintiffs."
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> Apparently satisfied with the clarification, UTEX neither moved for 
reconsideration of the order nor appealed from the judgment.  
Subse­quently, the trial court granted the motion for new trial of the 
two co-defendants Manuel and Castañeda, and after such new trial, it 
rendered under date of October 23, 1972 its decision against them which 
was substantially the same as its first decision of May 3, 1971 which 
had already become final and executory as against UTEX, declaring 
petitioners-spouses the owners of the questioned shares of stock in the 
names of aforementioned co-defendants Castañeda and Manuel and ordering 
the cancellation of the certificates in their names and to issue new 
ones in the names of petitioners. </p>
<p> Co-defendants Castañeda and Manuel appealed this judgment of October
 23, 1972 against them to the Court of Appeals (now Intermediate 
Appellate Court), which rendered on September 1, 1978 its judgment 
affirming in toto the trial court's judgment.  Said co-defendants sought
 to appeal the appellate court's adverse judgment on a petition for 
review with this Court, which rendered its Resolution of March 7, 1979 
denying the petition for review for lack of merit and the judgment 
against the defendants accordingly became final and executory. </p>
<p>
At petitioners' instance, the lower court issued a writ of execution and a specific order of December 5, 1979 directing UTEX
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.  To effect the cancellation of the certificates of stock in 
question in the names of B. R. Castañeda and Gene G. Manuel and the 
issuance of new ones in the names of the plaintiffs; </p>
  <p> "2.  To pay the amount of P100, 701. 45 representing the cash 
dividends that accrued to the same stocks from 1972 to 1979 with 
interest thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of the 
service of the writ of execution on October 3, 1979 until fully paid."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon UTEX motion for partial reconsideration alleging that the cash 
dividends of the stocks corresponding to the period from 1972 to 1979 
had already been paid and delivered by it to co-defendants Castañeda and
 Manuel who then still appeared as the registered owners of the said 
shares, the lower court issued its order of January 4, 1980 granting 
said motion of UTEX and partially reconsidered its order "to the effect 
that the defendant Universal Textile Mills, Inc. is absolved from paying
 the cash dividend corresponding to the stocks in question to the 
plaintiffs for the period 1972 to 1979. "
</p><p>
Hence, the present action for <em>certiorari </em>to set aside respondent judge's questioned order of January 4, 1980 as having been issued without jurisdiction and for <em>mandamus</em>
 to compel respondent judge to perform his ministerial duty of ordering 
execution of the final and executory judgment against UTEX according to 
its terms.
</p><p>
The Court finds merit in the petition and accordingly grants the same.
</p><p>
The final and executory judgment against UTEX in favor of petitioners, 
declared petitioners as the owners of the questioned UTEX shares of 
stock as againsts its co-defendants Castañeda and Manuel.  It was 
further made clear upon UTEX' own motion for clarification that all 
dividends accruing to the said shares of stock <em>after</em> the 
rendition of the decision of August 7, 1971 which for the period from 
1972 to 1979 amounted to P100, 701.45 were to be paid by UTEX to 
petitioners, and UTEX, per the trial court's order of clarification of 
June 16, 1971 above quoted had expressly maintained "it would rightfully
 abide by whatever decision may be rendered by this Honorable Court 
since such would be the logical consequence <em>after</em> the declaration or ruling in respect to the rightful ownership of the said shares of stock."
</p><p>
Consequently, there is no legal nor equitable basis for respondent 
judge's position "that it would indeed be most unjust and inequitable to
 require the defendant Universal Textile Mills, Inc. to pay twice cash 
dividends on particular shares of stocks."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  If UTEX nevertheless chose to pay the wrong parties, notwithstanding 
its full knowledge and understanding of the final judgment, that it was 
liable to pay all dividends <em>after</em> the trial court's judgment in
 1971 to petitioners as the lawfully declared owners of the questioned 
shares of stock (but which could not be enforced against it pending the 
outcome of the appeal filed by the co-defendants Castañeda and Manuel in
 the Court of Appeals), it only had itself to blame therefor.
</p><p>
The burden of recovering the supposed payment of the cash dividends made
 by UTEX to the wrong parties Castañeda and Manuel squarely falls upon 
itself by its own action and cannot be passed by it to petitioners as 
innocent parties.  It is elementary that payment made by a judgment 
debtor to a wrong party cannot extinguish the judgment obligation of 
such debtor to its creditor.  It is equally elementary that once a 
judgment becomes final and executory, the court which rendered it cannot
 change or modify the same in any material aspect such as what 
respondent judge has without authority attempted to do with his 
questioned order, which would relieve the judgment debtor UTEX of its 
acknowledged judgment obligation to pay to petitioners as the lawful 
owners of the questioned shares of stock, the cash dividends that 
accrued <em>after</em> the rendition of the judgment recognizing them as the lawful owners.  (Miranda <em>vs.</em>
 Tiangco, 96 Phil. 526 [1995]).  Execution of a final and executory 
judgment according to its terms is a matter of right for the prevailing 
party and becomes the ministerial duty of the court (De los Angeles <em>vs.</em> Victoriano, 109 Phil.12).
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, judgment is rendered setting aside the questioned order of January 4, 1980 of respondent judge and a writ of <em>mandamus</em>
 is hereby issued commanding said respondent judge to order the 
execution of his judgment against respondent Universal Textile Mills, 
Inc., pursuant to his first order of June 16, 1971 ordering it to pay 
the sum of P100, 701. 45, representing the cash dividends that accrued 
to petitioners' UTEX shares of stock from 1972 to 1979, with interest 
thereon at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of service of the 
writ of execution on October 3, 1979 until fully paid, as well as to pay
 petitioners any subsequent cash dividends that may have been issued by 
it thereafter, with interest from due date of payment until actual 
payment, and directing the sheriff to satisfy such judgment out of the 
properties of respondent UTEX.  With costs against respondent UTEX.  
This judgment is immediately executory.
