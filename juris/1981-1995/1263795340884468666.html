against the accused <span class="SpellE">Balatayo</span> had been returned
unsatisfied on account of his insolvency, not disputed, the Court found other

pay the widow <span class="SpellE">Madula</span> P6,000 and thus persuaded her to
sign an affidavit of desistance (marked Exhibit 1), but this amount was never
paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only amount in fact given by <span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> was P1,500.00, which was used to defray the burial
expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that the conviction of the employee is binding and conclusive upon the employer

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> filed a notice of appeal, and a
motion to recall the writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Madula</span> opposed the appeal, and in turn moved for the

<p class="BODY">By Order dated <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1982">May 12,
 1982</st1:date>, the Trial Court denied <span class="SpellE">Ozoas's</span>
appeal and his motion to recall writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court declared that on account of <span class="SpellE">Ozoa's</span>
failure to submit an appeal bond and a record on appeal, only a notice of
appeal having been filed by him, his appeal had not been perfected within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of 30 days; and that, moreover, the
correct remedy was not appeal but the special civil action of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">certiorari</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Order of <st1:date month="5" day="12" year="1982">May 12,
 1982</st1:date> is now challenged by <span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> before
us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that the order should be
annulled because tainted by grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He argues that -</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>An employer may appeal
from an order finding him <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> civilly liable
in the same criminal proceeding and in the same manner as in appeals in
criminal cases.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>It was error for the
Trial Court to deny his appeal for failure on his part to submit a record on
appeal and an appeal bond because in appeals in criminal cases, only a notice
of appeal need be filed to perfect the appeal; and he did file the requisite
notice of appeal within 15 days from notice of the order declaring him <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable, i.e., within the period prescribed for
appeals in criminal cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employer
should be allowed to appeal as regards the civil aspect of the criminal case,
since a new and different matter is involved, and the judgment declaring him
liable can not be deemed to have become final merely because the criminal
action has itself become final.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>It was beyond the power
of the Court <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

perfection of the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The perfection

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the correctness of the legal principles cited by the
Court <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">a quo</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>cannot be gainsaid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
person criminally liable is also civilly liable; and upon the institution of
the criminal action, the civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">action
for the recovery of the civil liability arising from the crime is also
impliedly instituted unless waived, or the filing of a separate action <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is reserved.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The employer is <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>

be also civilly liable is conclusive on the employer not only as to the
actuality of that liability but also as to its amount.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the foregoing statement does not exhaust the entirety of the
rules relevant and applicable to the juridical situation under
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is the additional
precept, of which sight should not be lost because essential to due process,
that before the employer's subsidiary liability is exacted, there must be
adequate evidence establishing that (1) he is indeed the employer of the
convict; (2) that he is engaged in some kind of industry; (3) the crime was committed
by the employee in the discharge of his duties; and (4) execution against the
employee is unsatisfied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> The
determination of these issues need not be done in a separate civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But a determination there must be, on the
basis of evidence that the offended party and the employer may fully and freely
present; and this may be done in the same criminal action at which the
employee's liability, criminal and civil, has been pronounced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be done at a hearing set for that
precise purpose, with due notice to the employer, "as part of the
proceeding for the execution of the judgment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying that the determination thus made as
regards the employer's subsidiary civil liability is not conclusive in the
sense of being non-<span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by higher judicial
authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be appealed to a
higher court at the instance of the aggrieved party -- either the offended
party or the employer -- by writ of error seeking review of questions of fact
or mixed questions of fact and law,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4</span></span></a> or
through a petition for review on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>limited to a consideration only of
questions of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">5</span></span></a> Or review
may be sought by the institution of a special civil action of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>upon the
theory that the determination was made by the Trial Court without or in excess
of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, there is no explicit rule or law governing the situation
dealt with in the case at bar, at least as to the precise manner and time in
which an appeal may be taken from any <span class="SpellE">adjudgment</span> of
an employer's subsidiary civil <span class="SpellE">liabiity</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not surprising since the basic
proposition itself -- that adjudication of the employer's subsidiary civil
liability need not be done by separate suit against the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">employer but merely in the same criminal action which resulted in the
judgment declaring the employee liable both criminally and civilly -- has not
been laid down by legislation, but by judicial construction of related
statutory provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A party should not
therefore be strictly held to account for any mistake as to the proper mode of
appeal in such a situation which, as it were, is yet largely uncharted
territory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It does not seem reasonable to apply the rules on appeal in civil
actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceeding in question was
not after all a civil action, but one considered a part or a continuation of
the criminal action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The more logical
step then is to apply the corresponding rules in criminal cases, which provide
that an appeal is taken simply by filing a notice of appeal within fifteen (15)
days from notice or promulgation of the judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's theory, on the other hand, that this
fifteen-day period for appeal should be reckoned from the time the accused
pleaded guilty and commenced to serve sentence, on May 17, 1978, and not from
the issuance of the Order for the execution of the judgment against <span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> on May 12, 1982, is obviously incorrect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no occasion to speak of enforcing
the employer's subsidiary civil liability until and unless it appears that the
employee's primary liability cannot in the first instance be satisfied by
reason of insolvency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact cannot,
in the very nature of things, be known until some time after the verdict of
conviction shall have become final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
even if it appear <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">prima facie</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>that execution against the employee
cannot be satisfied, execution against the employer will not issue as a matter
of course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There must first be, as above
pointed out, a determination that the convict was in truth in the employ of the
employer, that the latter is engaged in some kind of industry, and the employee
committed the crime to which civil liability attaches while in the performance
of his duties as such.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is from this
Court order embodying that determination that an appeal should be taken; and it
is from notice of this order that the 15-day period of appeal must be counted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court's view that the remedy against an order of
execution is not appeal but the special civil action of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">certiorari</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>is not correct
either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As already above declared, the
appropriate remedy is either an appeal by writ of error or by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">certiorari</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">, </span>depending on the nature of the questions sought to be
raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exceptionally, the special civil
action of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">certiorari</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>may be resorted to as a vehicle for
review if the claim be of lack or excess of jurisdiction, or the attendance of
grave abuse of discretion, in the issuance of the order of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, even if the appeal were
mistakenly directed to the Court of Appeals despite raising only questions of
law, the mistake would not be fatal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appeal would not be dismissed but referred to the Supreme Court "with a
specific and clear statement of the grounds therefor."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was therefore error for the Trial Court to have declined to
give due course to <span class="SpellE">Ozoa's</span> appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under ordinary circumstances, this error
should suffice to justify reinstatement of <span class="SpellE">Ozoa's</span>
appeal and directing its referral to the Court of Appeals in due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To do so however would only prolong the
litigation to no valid purpose, and to the prejudice of the parties entitled to
execution of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is in fact no need for any further proceedings in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have gone over the record quite
carefully and are convinced that <span class="SpellE">Ozoa's</span> subsidiary
civil responsibility has been duly established by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That evidence was presented at a hearing at
which <span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> was given opportunity to submit, as he did
submit proofs in his behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree
that the facts proven adequately demonstrate the existence of the requisites
for holding <span class="SpellE">Ozoa</span> <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span>
liable as an employer under Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code, specified
earlier in this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case is remanded to the Trial Court which
