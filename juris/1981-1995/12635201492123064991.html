<p class="BODY">In a complaint dated December 12, 1973 before the lower court, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> (hereinafter
referred to as <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>) averred that he was an
enlisted man in good standing of a guerilla organization who took active parti­cipation
in the liberation drive against the enemy in the last world war; that due to
said military service, he con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">tracted
pulmonary tuberculosis which rendered him permanently incapacitated; that on or
about April 22, 1950, he filed a disability claim for pension with the defunct
Philippine Veterans Board (later succeeded by Philippine Veterans Ad­ministration,
now Philippine Veterans Affairs Office) pursuant to Section 9 of R.A. 65, which
claim was approved on July 20, 1950 but only at the rate of P25.00 a month </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">instead </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of P50.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">as provided </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">said Act. It was
further asserted in the complaint that on June 22, 1957, said Section 9 was
amended by Republic Act No. 1920 increasing the monthly pension for those who
are permanently incapacitated from P50.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to P100.00 and granting
the amount of P10.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for their unmarried minor children; that
despite the amendment, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo's</span> monthly pension
was increased only to P50.00 and his two minor children were not extended any
benefit; that on or about the year 1966, his pension was raised to P60.00 a
month. Likewise, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> claimed that said Section
was further amended by Republic Act No. 5753 on June 22, 1969 increasing the
monthly pension of those per­manently incapacitated from P100.00 to P200.00 but
not withstanding the amendment, his monthly pension of P60.00 remained the same
from said date until the complaint was filed in the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer dated June 25, 1974, the Philippine Veterans
Affairs Office (PVAO for short) alleged that as shown by the records, the
service-connected disability of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> is
bronchitis, chronic secondary to gunshot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">wound;
that <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> was initially awarded pension benefits
at the rate of P25.00 per month only because his disability was then rated at
50% disabling in accordance with the rating adopted by PVAO pursuant to law;
that when Republic Act No. 1920 took effect, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo's</span>
monthly pension was only increased to P50.00 because his disability was then
rated at 50% disabling and his minor children were not awarded additional
pension as he is not permanently inca­pacitated; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Estudillo's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> monthly pension was raised to P60.00 due to
the increase in severity of his service-connected disability to 60% as found
out during his sub­sequent re-rating; that <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
is still receiving P60.00 a month because his service-connected disability
remains to be 60% disabling. PVAO set up the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">defenses </span>that the disability of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
is not permanent, hence, he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not entitled to differentials and additional
benefits allowed by law; that the findings of an administrative body should not
be <span class="SpellE">interferred</span> with by the court; that the claim of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> was approved on July 20, 1950, thus his cause of
action, if any, has prescribed when the case was filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts thus stipulated, the lower court as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, rendered its questioned decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>. The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>resolving

to the full benefits of Republic Act No. 65 and of the subsequent amendatory
laws, started on the premise that to be entitled to the benefits allowed under
said laws, one has to be permanently incapa­citated from work. The respondent
court brushed aside the argument of PVAO that <span class="SpellE">Estudillo's</span>
disability is merely partial and is rated only 60% by ruling that when the
claim of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> for disability pension was
approved, it can only be assumed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">that </span>he
is permanently disabled, otherwise, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> would
have not been given the monthly pensions. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Furthermore,
the rating </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">given </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on the incapacity of
<span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> as a basis for the amount of monthly
pension is not justi­fied because the laws involved do not provide for ratings.
The lower court held as untenable <span class="SpellE">PVAO's</span> defense of
pres­cription because the claim of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> is
continuing and there was partial compliance by PVAO.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">PVAO's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> motion for reconsideration having been
denied, the present case was instituted, raising the following arguments:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Disability of veteran <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
only partial, hence the decision of respondent judge awarding full pension
benefits to him is erroneous.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no appropriated funds to
cover the claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of </span>private
respondent and the res­pondent judge erred in compelling its payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent judge erred in not finding
that the money claim of private respondent has already prescribed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent judge erred in ordering
peti­tioner pay attorney's fees and costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> is
entitled to the full benefits of Section 9 of R.A. 65 and its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">amendatory </span>Acts, as raised in the
first argument, constitutes the core <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of
the present controversy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">PVAO argues that Section 9 of R.A. 65, as amended by R.A. 1920
and R.A. 5753, limits the coverage of its provision to those veterans who are
permanently incapacitated for work. PVAO contends that in paragraphs 2 and 7 of
the joint stipulation of facts, it was admitted by <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
that as a consequence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">his </span>military
service, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">con</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">tracted bronchitis and for which he was given
by PVAO a disability rating of only 60%. The aforesaid stipulated facts, the
PVAO stressed, bind the court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">so
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">as not to extend to <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> the full benefits of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> anchors
his right to recover differential pensions and allowances for his minor
children on the basis of the rulings of this Court on the cases of <span class="SpellE">Begosa</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">vs. </span>Philippine

<span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> argues that in <span class="SpellE"><u>Begosa</u></span>,
the disability was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">only </span>30%,
while in <span class="SpellE"><u>Teoxon</u></span> it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

permanent, they were awarded the full benefits of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We agree with the PVAO.
The issue is not a novel one for this Court, in the similar case of Board of
Administra­tors, PVA vs. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

15.0pt"> case) has settled this question. In said case, veteran-claimant Mauro <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> filed before the lower court a petition for mandamus
seeking to recover his differential pensions and the monthly allowances for his
wife and minor children. <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> and PVA submitted to
the lower court a stipulation of facts stating that <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>
was not permanently incapacitated; that upon physical examination, his incapa­city
was rated as only 50% by the PVAO and he was given the corresponding monthly
pension in the amount of P25.00; that after a re-rating, <span class="SpellE">Abrera's</span>
disability was increased to 75% and his monthly pension was likewise increased;
that after a subsequent re-rating, his disability was reduced to 60% with a
corresponding decrease in his monthly pension. On the facts stipulated and the
memoranda </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">submitted by the
parties, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the lower court
rendered judgment awarding <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> full pension
benefits, including allowances for his wife and minor children. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">On </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">appeal, this Court, in setting aside the decision of the lower court,
said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, however, the provisions of the
stipulation of facts clearly evince one inescapable fact: that <span class="SpellE">Abrera's</span> disability did not render him permanently
incapacitated for work. When it formulated its decision in civil case 90373,
the court disregarded this material fact, and consequently failed to draw a
conclusion consistent therewith. Stipula­tion by parties to a litigation
regarding certain facts require no further evidence and cannot be contradicted
unless the party adversely affected can show that he agreed thereto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">through a </span>palpable mis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">take. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">In the case at bar, <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> has </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">made no attempt to demonstrate, directly or
inferentially, that he entered into the stipulation of facts through a pal­pable
mistake.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">quo</span></u> erred when it entered a judgment inconsistent with the
facts agreed upon by the parties. Where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the
parties submit the case on a stipula­tion of facts, the court should render
judgment strictly in accordance therewith. Otherwise, the judgment is inefficacious.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the explicit language of section 9 of Republic
Act 65, as amended, leaves no room for doubt: it makes available full pension
benefits only to those 'who are permanently incapacitated from work,' and only
when the veteran is permanently disabled may his wife and minor children be
entitled to receive the pensions specifically provided for them by law. The
words '<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">permanently incapacitated' have
a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">res</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">trictive signification which cannot be con­veniently
disregarded. Application of the law according to its plain terms the court
failed to do, for, it extended to <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">full </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">pension benefits accorded only to those who fall within the ambit of
the strict statutory qualification."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On the issue of prescription, PVAO asserts that <span class="SpellE">Estudillo's</span> right of action to recover the alleged
differential pensions under R.A. 65 and R.A. 1920 accrued on April 22, 1950 and
June 22, 1957, respectively. PVAO maintains that under Article 1144 of the
Civil Code, an action based upon an obligation created by law must be brought
within ten (10) years from the time the right of action accrues. It<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> is thus obvious, the PVAO alleges, that the
said claims of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> have already prescribed
because the present case was filed before the lower court only on December 17,
1973.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As has been previously shown, <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
is not entitled to differential pensions and allowances for his minor children
under R.A. 65 and R.A. 1920. Hence, it is no longer necessary to dwell into the
issue of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Regarding <span class="SpellE">Estudillo's</span> claim under R.A. 5753, the PVAO does not
dispute its validity but points out that there is no appropriated funds to
satisfy the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> claim for differential pensions.
It should be noted that R.A. 5753 took effect on June 22, 1969 increasing the
monthly pension for permanently incapacitated veterans from P100.00 to P200.00.
At that time, the disability rating of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">60% </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"We note that the amount of the monthly pension given to him
in the past was based on his physical disability rating multiplied by the
amount of the monthly pension pres­cribed by the law. Thus, when section 9 of
Republic Act 65, as originally passed, provided for a monthly pension of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P50.00 </span>for permanently incapacitated
veterans and his disability rating was 50%, he was given a monthly pension of
P25.00; when Republic Act 1920 increased the monthly pension for permanently
disabled veterans from P50.00 to P100.00, and his disability rating was 75%,
the monthly pension given to him was P75.00; subsequently, when his disability
rating was reduced to 60%, his monthly pension was correspondingly reduced to
P60.00. But from January 1, 1972, when the petitioner implemented Republic Act
5753 which increased the monthly pension for permanently incapacitated veterans
from P100.00<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>to P200.00, instead
of increasing the monthly pension of <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> from
P60.00 to P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">120.00, </span>which latter
amount is 60% of P200.00, the petitioner continued to give <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>
a monthly pension of only P60.00. The inability of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the peti­</span>tioner to pay <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> the
differential of P60.00 in monthly pension is attributed by it, in its own words,
'to the failure of Congress to appropriate the necessary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">funds to cover all claims for benefits,
pensions and allowances.' And the peti­tioner states that it has 'no
alternative but to suspend (full) implementation of said laws until such time
as sufficient funds have been appropriated by Congress' to cover the total
amount of all approved claims.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"We </span>find the
explanation of the petitioner satisfactory, but we nevertheless hold that as a
matter of law <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span> is entitled to a monthly pension
of P120.00 from January 1, 1972 when Republic Act 5753 was implemented up to
the present, if his physical disabi­lity rating has continued and continues to
be 60%. Payment to him of what is due him from January 1, 1972 must how­ever
remain subject to the availability of Government funds duly set aside for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the purpose, and subject further to periodic
re-rating of his physical disability.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But even if we have thus defined the precise terms, nature
and scope of the entitlement of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>,
for the guidance of the petitioner, we nevertheless refrain from ordering the
petitioner to pay the amount of P120.00 per month from January 1, 1972 that is
due to the respondent by virtue of the mandate of section 9 of Republic Act 65,
as amended by Republic Act 5753, because the Government has thus far not
provided the neces­sary funds to pay all valid claims duly approved under the
authority of the said statute."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Clearly, therefore, while <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> is entitled to a monthly pension of P120.00,
payment to him of the afore­said pensions is subject to availability of
government funds appropriated for the purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the last ground relied upon in support of this petition, We
agree with the PVAO that the lower court committed an error in ordering the
former to pay <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span> the amount of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">1,000.00 </span>for attorney's fees and the
costs of the suit. Settled is the rule that costs of suit are not recoverable
against government entities and officers when they are sued purely in their
official capacity as was petitioner in this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

And there being no showing that PVAO acted in bad faith and disregarded in a
wanton manner the rights of <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>, the award of
attorney's fees is unjustified.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the questioned decision is hereby SET ASIDE and
another one is entered ordering PVAO to pay <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
the amount of P120.00 from June 22, 1969, the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of R.A. 5753, up to the present. Payment to <span class="SpellE">Estudillo</span>
of what is due him from June 22, 1969 is hereby declared subject to the
availability of Government funds appropriated for the purpose.</p>
