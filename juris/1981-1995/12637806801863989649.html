				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for
review seeking to annul and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals, now
the Intermediate Appellate Court, affirming the order of the trial court which
dismissed the petitioners' complaint for cancellation of their real estate
mortgage and held them jointly and severally liable with the principal debtors
on a promissory note which they signed as accommodation makers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The factual background of
this case is stated in the decision of the appellate court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Appellants are the registered owners of a parcel of land
located in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila, and covered by T.C.T.
35161 of the Register of <span style="">Deeds of
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1954" day="7" month="10"><span style="">October 7, 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">, this property was mortgaged by the
appellants to the Philippine National Bank, hereinafter called PNB, to
guarantee a loan of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> extended to one Domingo <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Sometime in 1955, the <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> Construction Company, hereinafter called
Company, had a pending contract with the Bureau of Public Works, hereinafter called
the Bureau, for the construction of the municipal building in Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, in the amount
of P36,800.00 and, as said Company needed funds for said construction, Jose <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, appellants' relative, and attorney-in-fact of the
Company, approached the appellants asking them to mortgage their property to
secure the loan of P10,000.00 which the Company was negotiating with the PNB.</p>

<p class="2Q">"After some persuasion appellants signed on <st1:date year="1955" day="23" month="12">December 23, 1955</st1:date> the 'Amendment of
Real Estate Mortgage', mortgaging their said property to the PNB to guaranty
the loan of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> extended to the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The terms and conditions of the original
mortgage for P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> were made integral part of the
new mortgage for P10,000.00 and both documents were registered with the
Register of Deeds of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
promissory note covering the loan of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> dated <st1:date year="1955" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1955</st1:date>, maturing on <st1:date year="1956" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1956</st1:date>, was signed by Jose <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, as attorney-in-fact of the Company, and by the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants also signed the
portion of the promissory note indicating that they are requesting the PNB to
issue the Check covering the loan to the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date (December 23, 1955) that the
'Amendment of Real Estate' was executed, Jose <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>,
in the same capacity as attorney-in-fact of the Company, executed also the
'Deed of Assignment' assigning all payments to be made by the Bureau to the
Company-on account of the contract for the construction of the Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> building in favor of the PNB.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"This assignment of
credit to the contrary notwithstanding, the Bureau, with approval, of the PNB,
conditioned, however that they should be for Labor and materials, made three
payments to the Company on account of the contract price <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P11,234.40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau's last request
for P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on </span><st1:date year="1956" day="20" month="6"><span style="">June 20, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, however, was denied by the PNB for the
reason that since the loan was already overdue as of </span><st1:date year="1956" day="28" month="4"><span style="">April
 28, 1956</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
remaining balance of the contract price should be applied to the loan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The Company abandoned the work, as a consequence of which on <st1:date year="1956" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1956</st1:date>, the Bureau rescinded
the construction contract and assumed the work of completing the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1958" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1958</st1:date>, appellants wrote the PNB contending that since the PNB
authorized payments to the Company instead of on account of the loan guaranteed
by the mortgage there was a change in the conditions of the contract without
the knowledge of appellants, which entitled the latter to a cancellation of
their mortgage contract.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Failing <span style="">in </span>their
bid to have the real estate mortgage cancelled, appellants filed <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1959</st1:date> this action against the PNB, the Company,
the latter's attorney-in­-fact Jose <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, and the
District Engineer of Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>, seeking the cancellation of their
real estate mortgage. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The complaint was
amended to exclude the Company as defendant, it having been shown that its life
as a part­nership had already expired and, in lieu thereof, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> and Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>,
partners of the defunct Company, were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in
their private capacity as defendants."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After hearing, the, trial
court rendered judgment, denying the prayer in the complaint that the </span><span style="">petitioners be absolved </span><span style="">from their obligation under the mortgage
contract and that the said mortgage be released </span><span style="">or can</span><span style="">celled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners were ordered to pay jointly
and severally with their co-makers Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
and Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span> the sum of P11<span class="GramE">,900.19</span>
with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the filing of the
complaint on </span><st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="6"><span style="">June 27, 1959</span></st1:date><span style=""> until fully paid and P1,000.00 attorney's
fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The decision also
provided that if the judgment was not satisfied within 90 days from its
receipt, the mortgaged properties together with all the improvements thereon
belonging to the petitioners would be sold at public auction and applied to the
judgment debt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals
affirmed the trial court's decision in <span class="SpellE">toto</span> stating
that, as accommodation makers, the petitioners' liability is that of <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> co-makers and that since "the amounts
released to the construction company were used therein and, therefore, were
spent for the successful accomplishment of the work cons­tructed for, the
authorization made by the Philippine National Bank of partial payments to the
construction company which was also one </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors cannot constitute a valid defense on the
part of the other <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, those who rendered services and
furnished materials in the construction are preferred creditors and have a lien
on the price of the contract." The appellate court further held that PNB
had no obliga­tion whatsoever to notify the petitioners of its authorizing the
three payments in the total amount of P11<span class="GramE">,234.00</span> in
favor of the Company because aside from the fact that the petitioners were not
parties to the deed of assign­ment, there was </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">stipulation in said
deed making it obligatory on the part of the PNB to notify the peti­tioners <span class="SpellE">everytime</span> it authorizes payment to the Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that the petitioners cannot ask to
be released from the real estate mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this petition, the
petitioners raise the follow­ing issues which they present in the form of
errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First Assignment of Error.</p>

<p class="2Q">THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT HEREIN PETITIONERS
WERE SOLIDARY CO-DEBTORS <span style="">INSTEAD OF SURETIES.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">II<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second</span> Assignment of Error.</p>

<p class="2Q">THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONERS WERE
NOT RELEASED FROM THEIR OBLIGATION TO THE RESPONDENT PNB, WHEN THE PNB, WITHOUT
THE KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF PETITIONERS, CHANGED THE TENOR AND CONDITION OF
THE ASSIGNMENT OF PAYMENTS MADE BY THE PRINCIPAL DEBTOR, CONCEPCION &amp;
TAMAYO CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, AND RELEASED TO SUCH PRINCIPAL DEBTOR PAYMENTS
FROM THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC WORKS WHICH WERE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO WIPE OUT THE
INDEBTEDNESS TO THE PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners contend
that as accommodation makers, the nature of their liability is only that of
mere sureties </span><span style="">instead of <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> co-<span class="SpellE">destors</span> such that
"a material alteration in the principal contract, <span class="GramE">effected</span>
by the creditor without the knowledge and consent of the sure­ties, completely
discharges the sureties from all liability on the contract of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>." They state that when respondent PNB did
not apply the initial and subsequent payments to the petitioner‘s debt as
provided for in the deed of assignment, they were released from their
obligation as sureties and, therefore, the real estate mortgage executed by
them should have been cancelled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 29 of the
Negotiable Instrument Law provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"<u>Liability of accommodation party</u>.</span>
- An accommodation party is one who has signed the instrument as maker, drawer,
acceptor, or <span class="SpellE">indorser</span>, without receiving value <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and for the purpose of lending his name to some
other person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a person is liable on
the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder at the time
of taking the instrument knew him to be only an accommodation party."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of <u>Philippine
Bank </u></span><u>of Commerce v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Aruego</span></span><span style=""> (102 SCRA 530, 539), we held that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in lending his name to the accommodated party, the accommodation
party is in effect a surety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span>
However, unlike in a contract of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>, the
liability of the accommodation party remains not only primary but also
unconditional to a holder for value such that even if the accommodated party
receives an extension of the period for payment without the consent of the
accommodation party, the latter is still liable for the whole obligation and
such extension </span><span style="">does not release </span><span style="">him because as far as a holder for value is
concerned, he is a <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> co-debtor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Expounding on the nature
of the liability of an accommodation party under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
section, we ruled in </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ang</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> v. Ting</u> <span style="">(22
SCRA 713, 716):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the appellant,
again assuming him to be an accommodation <span class="SpellE">indorser</span>,
may obtain security from the maker to protect himself against the danger of
insolvency of the latter, cannot in any manner affect his lia­bility to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, as the said remedy is a matter of concern exclusively
between accommodation <span class="SpellE">indorser</span> and accommodated
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that the appellant stands only
as a surety in relation to the maker, granting this to be true for the sake of
argument, is immaterial to the <span style="">claim of
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, and does not a whit diminish nor defeat
the rights of the latter who is a holder for value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liability of the appel­lant remains
primary and unconditional.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sanction
the appellant's theory is to give unwarranted legal recognition to the patent
absurdity of a situation where an <span class="SpellE">indorser</span>, when sued
on an </span><span style="">instrument </span><span style="">by a holder in due course and for value, can
escape liability </span><span style="">on his </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">indorsement</span></span><span style=""> by the convenient expedient of interposing
the defense that he is a mere accommodation <span class="SpellE">indorser</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is, therefore, no
question that as accommo­dation makers, petitioners would be primarily and unconditionally
liable on the promissory note to a holder for value, regardless of whether they
stand as sureties or <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> co-debtors since such
distinction would be entirely immaterial and inconsequential as far as a holder
for value is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
the petitioners cannot claim to have been released from their obligation simply
because the time of payment of such obligation was temporarily deferred by PNB
without their knowledge and consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There has to be another basis for their claim of having been freed from
their obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question which
should be resolved in this instant petition, therefore, is whether or not PNB
can be considered a holder for value under Section 29 of the Negotiable Instruments
Law such that the petitioners must be necessarily barred from setting up the
defense of want of consi­deration or some other personal defenses which may be
set up against a party who is not a holder in due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A </span><span style="">holder for value under Section 29 of the
Negotiable Instruments Law is one who must meet all the requirements of a
holder in due course under Section 52 </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the same law except
notice of want of consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>, Commercial Laws of the
Philippines, 1964, p. 208).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he
does not qualify as a holder in due course then he holds the instrument subject
to the same defenses as if it were non­negotiable (Section 58, Negotiable
Instruments Law).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, can
PNB, the payee of the promissory note <span class="GramE">be</span> considered a
holder in due course?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners contend that
the payee PNB is an immediate party and, therefore, is not a holder in due
course and stands on no better footing than a mere assignee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In those cases where a
payee was considered a holder in due course, such payee either acquired the
note from another holder or has not directly dealt with the maker thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was held in the case of <u>Bank of
Commerce and Savings v. <span class="SpellE">Randell</span></u> (186
North-Western Reporter 71):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"We conclude, therefore, that a payee who receives a
negotiable promissory note, in good faith, for value, before maturity, and
without any notice of any infirmity, from a holder, not the maker, to whom it
was negotiated as a completed instrument, <span style="">is
</span>a holder in due course<span style=""> within
the purview of a Negotiable Instruments law, </span><span style="">so </span><span style="">as to preclude the
defense of fraud and failure of consideration between the maker and the holder
to whom the instrument was delivered."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, in the case of
<u>S</u></span><u><span style="">t</span></u><u><span style="">one v. Goldberg &amp;</span></u><span style=""> Lewis (60 Southern Reporter 748) on
rehearing and quoting Daniel on </span><span style="">Negotiable
</span>Instruments, <span style="">it was held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"It is a general principle of the law merchant that, as
between the <span style="">immediate parties </span>to
a negotiable instrument - the parties between whom there is a <span class="SpellE">privity</span> - the consi­deration may <span style="">be </span>inquired into; and as to them the only superiority of a bill
or note over other unsealed evidence of debt is that it prima facie imports a
consideration."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Although as a general
rule, a payee may be considered a holder in due course we think that such a
rule cannot apply with respect to the respondent </span>PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Not
only was PNB an immediate party or in privy to the promissory note, that is, it
had dealt directly with the petitioners knowing fully well that the latter only
signed as accommodation makers but more important, it was the Deed of Assignment
executed by the Construction Company in favor of PNB which principally moved
the petitioners to sign the promissory note also in favor </span><span style="">of PNB.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Petitioners <span style="">were made to
believe and </span>on <span style="">that belief
entered into the agreement that no other conditions would alter the terms
thereof and yet; PNB altered the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Deed of Assignment specifically provided that Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, on behalf of the Company, “have assigned,
transferred and conveyed and </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">these presents, do assign, transfer and
convey unto the said Philippine National Bank, its successors and assigns all
payments to be received from the Bureau of Public Works on account of contract
for the </span><span style="">construction </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> Municipal Building in <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>, involving the total amount of P36,000.00" and
that "This assignment shall be irrevocable and subject to the terms and
conditions of the promissory note and or any other kind of documents which the
Philippine National Bank have required or may require </span><span style="">the assignor to </span><span style="">execute to evidence the above-mentioned
obligation."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the terms of the above Deed, it is clear that there are no
further conditions which could possibly alter the agreement without the consent
of the petitioners such as the grant of greater priority to obligations other
than the payment of the loan due to the PNB and part of which loan was
guaranteed by the petitioners in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This, notwithstanding, PNB approved the Bureau's release of three
payments directly to the Company instead of paying the same to the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This approval was in violation of the Deed of
Assignment and without any notice to the petitioners who stood to lose their
property once the promissory note falls due without the same having been paid
because the PNB, in effect, waived payments of the first three releases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing circumstances, <span style="">PNB </span>can not be regarded as having
acted in good faith which is also <span style="">one
of </span>the requisites of a holder in due course under Section 52 of the
Negotiable Instruments Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">PNB </span>knew that the promissory note
which it <span style="">took from the accommodation
makers was signed by the latter because of full reliance on the Deed of
Assignment, which, PNB had no intention to comply with strictly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, the third payment to the Company </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the amount of P4<span class="GramE">,293.60</span> was approved by PNB
although the promissory note was almost a month overdue, </span><span style="">an </span><span style="">act which is clearly detri­mental to the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that respondent PNB is not a holder in due
course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petitioners can
validly set up their personal defense of release from the real estate mortgage
against PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, in authorizing
the third payment to the Company after the promissory note became due, in effect,
extended the term of the payment of the note without the <span style="">consent </span>of the accommodation makers
who stand as sureties to the accommodated party and to all other parties who
are <span style="">not </span>holders in due course or
who <span style="">do </span>not derive their right
from the same, including PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be argued that the <span class="SpellE">Prudencios</span>
could have mortgaged their property even without the promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show, however, that they would
not have mortgaged the lot were it not for the sake of the Company whose
attorney-in-fact was their relative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
spouses did not need the money for themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attorney-in-fact tried twice to <span style="">convince </span>the <span class="SpellE">Prudencios</span> to mortgage
their property in order to secure a loan <span style="">in
</span>favor of the Company but the <span class="SpellE">Prudencios</span>
refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the deed of
assignment was shown to the spouses that they consented to the mortgage and <span style="">signed the promissory note </span><span style="">in </span>the Bank's favor.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 2085 of the Civil
Code enumerates the requisites of a </span><span style="">valid </span><span style="">mortgage
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners do not dispute the
validity of the mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They only want
to </span><span style="">have </span><span style="">it cancelled because the Bank violated the
deed of </span><span style="">assignment </span><span style="">and extended the period of time of payment of
the promissory note without the petitioners' consent and </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">latter's </span><span style="">detriment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The mortgage cannot be separated from the promissory note for it
is the latter which is the basis of determin­ing whether the mortgage should be
foreclosed or cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without the
promissory note which determines the amount of indebtedness there would have
been no basis for the mort­gage.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, if <span style="">the </span>Bank
had not been the assignee, then the petitioners would be obliged to pay the
Bank as their cre­ditor on the promissory note, irrespective of whether or not
the deed of assignment had been violated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the assignee and the creditor in this case are one and the same
- the Bank itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">When </span>the Bank violated the deed of assignment,
it prejudiced itself because its very violation was the reason why it was not
paid on time in <span style="">its capacity as
creditor in the promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would be unfair to make the petitioners now answer for the debt or to foreclose
on their property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can PNB justify its acts on the ground that the <span style="">Bureau </span>of Public Works approved the
deed of assignment with the condition that the wages of laborers and materials
needed in the construction work must take precedence over <span style="">the payment of the promissory note.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, PNB did not need the
approval of the Bureau.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if it
did, it should have informed the petitioners about the amendment of the deed of
assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the wages and
materials have already been paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
issue is academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is in dispute is
who should bear the loss in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As between the petitioners and the Bank, the law and the equities of the
case favor the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And thirdly,
the wages and materials constitute a lien only on the constructed building but
do not enjoy pre­ference over the loan unless there is a liquidation pro­ceeding
such as in insolvency or settlement of estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See Philippine Savings Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, 124
