				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The parties submitted to this Court a compromise agreement, the terms and conditions of which are as follows:

<p></p><blockquote>
  <p>"1. Without admitting any liability and in the interest of 
industrial peace and harmonious employer-employee relation, MANILA BANK,
 upon ratification by at least a majority of the general membership of 
TMBSCEC, and approval by the Supreme Court of this Agreement, agrees to 
pay the sum of P2,500.00 to each of the remaining employees appearing in
 MANILA BANK's payroll as of September 30, 1984 who were covered by the 
1978-1981 CBA and who would be benefited should the Supreme Court rule 
against MANILA BANK in G.R. No. 62925, which amount shall be applied in 
payment of the loan of P2,500.00 which MANILA BANK extended to each of 
the covered employees in December 1983. </p>
  <p>"2. The foregoing payment shall be considered by TMBCEC, and TMBCEC
 expressly acknowledges and admits the said payment, as the full and 
complete settlement and satisfaction of any and all claims which the 
employees and TMBCEC may have against MANILA BANK for payment of the 
cost of living allowance under P.D. 1634 and for the unworked regular 
holidays. </p>
  <p>"3. During the forthcoming negotiation for renewal of the existing 
1983-1985 CBA, MANILA BANK shall favorably consider the grant of P90.00 
per month cost of living allowance to the employees benefited by this 
Agreement."

</blockquote>
<p>Finding the said compromise agreement not contrary to law, morals or 
public policy, the Court hereby approves the same and renders judgment 
in accordance therewith.
