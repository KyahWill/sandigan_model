reverse the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the respondent appellate court
dated March 3, 1987 in CA-G.R. CV No. 06911 entitled “Juana (Bueno) Albovias,
et al., v. Leonida <st1:city><st1:place>Coronado</st1:place></st1:city>, et
al.,” affirming the decision of the lower court, the decretal portion of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring Leonida <st1:city><st1:place>Coronado</st1:place></st1:city>
to have no title or interest over the property in question, hence, has no
authority to dispose of the same in favor of her co-defendants;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Declaring the sales executed by <st1:city><st1:place>Coronado</st1:place></st1:city>
and subsequent transactions involving the same property null and void <u>ab</u>
<u>initio</u>;</blockquote>

P10,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Costs against the defendants." (Rollo, p. 17)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As found by the respondent appellate court, the property subject
of this case is a parcel of land situated in Nagcarlan, Laguna, containing 277
square meters, more particularly described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A parcel of land situated in the Poblacion, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Nagcarlan</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Laguna</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bounded on the North, by property of Epifania
Irlandez (formerly Bonifacio Formentera); on the East, by that of Julio Lopez;
on the South, by that of Dalmacio Monterola (formerly Domingo Bueno); and on
the West, by <st1:street><st1:address>C. Lirio Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Containing an area of two hundred seventy
seven (277) square meters, more or less.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assessed at P3,320.00 under tax declaration No. 241."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Ibid., p. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Said parcel of land is being contested by Juana Albovias, herein
private respondent, on the one hand, and Leonida Coronado, Felix Bueno, Melania
Retizos, Bernardino Buenaseda and Jovita Montefalcon, herein petitioners, on
the other hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Juana Albovias (JUANA, for brevity) claims that the property in
question is a portion of a bigger lot referred to as Parcel G in the last will
and testament executed in 1918 by Melecio Artiaga, grandfather of JUANA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bigger lot was inherited under that will
by JUANA, her brother Domingo Bueno, and two other grandchildren, namely
Bonifacio and Herminigildo, both surnamed Formentera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parcel G is described as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Isang lagay na lupa na ang bahagi ay walang tanim na halaman
at ang bahagi naman ay may tanim na saguing, tumatayo sa gawing Canloran ng Calle
Avenida Rizal nitong Nagcarlan, at humahangan sa Ibaba; sa ari cong Testador;
sa Silangan, sa cay Enrique Jovellano; sa Ilaya, sa namatay na Perfecto
Nanagas, at sa Canloran, tubig na pinamamagatang San Cido." (Ibid., p. 16)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">JUANA further claims that sometime in 1925 or 1926, <st1:street><st1:address>C.
  Lirio street</st1:address></st1:street> was created by the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Nagcarlan</st1:placename></st1:place> traversing said Parcel
G and thus dividing it into two portions, one on the west of <st1:street><st1:address>C.
  Lirio St.</st1:address></st1:street> and the other to the east of said
street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parcel G was divided by the heirs
in the following manner:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the land was
divided into two portions, the northern portion of which was adjudicated in
favor of the Formenteras and the southern portion was given to JUANA and
Domingo Bueno.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The southern portion in
turn was partitioned between JUANA and Domingo Bueno, the former getting the
northern part adjoining the lot of the Formenteras, and the latter the southern
part which adjoins the lot of Perfecto Nanagas (now owned by Dalmacio
Monterola).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The part allocated to
Domingo was later sold by him to Dalmacio Monterola, owner of the adjoining
property (Ibid.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, JUANA claims that her property was included together
with the two parcels of land owned by Dalmacio Monterola, which were sold by
Monterola's successor-in-interest Leonida Coronado (now married to Felix Bueno)
to Melania Retizos on <st1:date year="1970" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Melania Retizos in turn sold the lots,
including that one being claimed by JUANA, to the spouses Bernardino Buenaseda
and Jovita Montefalcon, now the present possessors thereof, sometime in 1974
(Ibid.,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pp. 16-17)</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Leonida Coronado and her co-petitioners
(CORONADO, for brevity) claim that the property in question was bequeathed to
Leonida Coronado under a Will executed by Dr. Dalmacio Monterola, who was
allegedly in possession thereof even before the outbreak of World War II
(Ibid., p. 107).</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, said will was probated under Sp. Proc. No.
SC-283, entitled "Testate Estate of the Deceased Monterola, Leonida F.
Coronado, petitioner (Ibid., p. 105).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>JUANA, together with her husband, opposed the said probate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite their opposition, however, the Will
was allowed by the then Court of First Instance of Laguna, Sta. Cruz Branch
(Ibid., p. 106).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, said
decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 40353, entitled
“Leonida F. Coronado, petitioner-appellee v. Heirs of Dr. Dalmacio Monterola,
"oppositors-appellants" (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not apparent, however, from the record whether or not said
decision has already become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the conflicting claims over the property in
question, JUANA filed an action for quieting of title, declaratory relief and
damages against CORONADO in the Regional Trial Court of the Fourth Judicial
Region, Branch XXVI, Sta. Cruz, Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. 7345 (Ibid.,
p. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">As adverted to above (first par.), the lower court rendered
judgment in favor of JUANA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the lower court, <st1:city><st1:place>CORONADO</st1:place></st1:city>
elevated the case to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the decision appealed
from (Ibid., p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:city><st1:place>CORONADO</st1:place></st1:city> raised the
following assigned errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RESPONDENT COURT OF

SUBMITTED AND FACTS ADMITTED ON RECORD.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>IT THEREFORE COMMITTED GRAVE AND SERIOUS ERROR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid., p. 121)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As required by this Court, <st1:city><st1:place>CORONADO</st1:place></st1:city>
filed their memorandum on <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1989</st1:date>
(Ibid., p. 105); while that of JUANA was filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1989</st1:date> (Ibid., p. 139).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error, <st1:city><st1:place>CORONADO</st1:place></st1:city>
assails the respondent appellate court's finding that Dr. Dalmacio Monterola
could not have acquired the subject land by acquisitive prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citing Art. 1116 of the New Civil Code in
relation to Section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure, CORONADO claims that
JUANA had already foreclosed whatever right or legal title she had over the
property in question, the reason being that Monterola's continued possession of
the said property for over ten years since 1934 ripened into full and absolute
ownership (Ibid., p. 112).</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument has no factual basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, it has been ruled that the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in cases brought to it from the Court of Appeals is limited to
reviewing and revising the errors of law imputed to it, its findings of fact
being conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not the function
of the Supreme Court to analyze or weigh such evidence all over again, its
jurisdiction being limited to reviewing errors of law that might have been
committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent, therefore, a showing
that the findings complained of are totally devoid of support in the record, so
that they are so glaringly erroneous as to constitute serious abuse of
discretion, such findings must stand, for the Supreme Court is not expected or
required to examine or contrast the oral and documentary evidence submitted by
the parties (Andres v. Manufacturers Hanover &amp; Trust Corporation, G.R.
82670, September 15, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are no
convincing reasons in the instant case to depart from this rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the respondent appellate court, Monterola never
claimed ownership over the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, one of the deeds of
donation executed by Monterola in favor of Leonida Coronado acknowledged that
the boundary owner on the property conveyed to her is JUANA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the reason why during the
lifetime of the late Dalmacio Monterola, JUANA had always been allowed to enter
and reap the benefits or produce of the said property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the death of said Monterola
in 1970 that Leonida Coronado prohibited JUANA from entering it (Ibid., p. 18).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <u>arguendo</u> that Monterola was indeed in
continued possession of the said property for over ten years since 1934, said
possession is insufficient to constitute the fundamental basis of the
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Possession, under the
Civil Code, to constitute the foundation of a prescriptive right, must be
possession under claim of title (<u>en</u> <u>concepto</u> <u>de</u> <u>dueno</u>),
or to use the common law equivalent of the term, it must be adverse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acts of possessory character performed by one
who holds by mere tolerance of the owner are clearly not <u>en</u> <u>concepto</u>
<u>de</u> <u>dueno</u>, and such possessory acts, no matter how long so
continued, do not start the running of the period of prescription (Manila
Electric Company v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. 71393, June 28, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, Monterola, as found by the respondent appellate
court and the lower court, never categorically claimed ownership over the
property in question, much less his possession thereof <u>en</u> <u>concepto</u>
<u>de</u> <u>dueno</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he
could not have acquired said property by acquisitive prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the contention of CORONADO that Leonida Coronado could tack
her possession to that of Monterola, so that claim of legal title or ownership
over the subject property, even against the petitioners, the Buenasesas, who
are purchasers for value and in good faith, is a foregone or settled issue, the
respondent appellate court aptly answered the same in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"It follows that Leonida Coronado could not have derived
ownership of the land in question from her predecessor-in-interest Dalmacio
Monterola, whether by prescription or by some other title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can she claim acquisitive prescription
in her own name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in 1970
after the death of Dalmacio Monterola that she asserted her claim of ownership
adverse to that of plaintiff-appellee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having knowledge that she had no title over the land in question, she
must be deemed to have claimed it in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Article 1137 of the Civil Code, ownership and other real rights
over immovables prescribe through uninterrupted adverse possession thereof for
thirty years, without need of title or good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even granting that she had no notice or
defect in her title and was, therefore, in good faith, a period of ten years of
possession is necessary for her to acquire the land by ordinary
prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Article 1134, Civil
Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she can claim to have
possessed the land only in 1968, the year the Monterola lots were donated to
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period, however, was
interrupted in 1975, or 7 years after, when the complaint below was
filed." (Rollo, pp. 18-19)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assigned error, CORONADO claims that the will
under which JUANA inherited the property in question from her grandfather,
Melecio Artiaga, was never probated; hence, said transfer of ownership was
ineffectual considering that under Rule 75, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court
(formerly Sec. 125 of Act No. 190, no will shall pass either real or personal
property unless it is proved and allowed in the proper court (Ibid., p. 115).</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that no will shall pass either real or personal
property unless it is proved and allowed in the proper court (Art. 838, Civil
Code), the questioned will, however, may be sustained on the basis of Article
1056 of the Civil Code of 1899, which was in force at the time said document
was executed by Melecio Artiaga in 1918.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said article read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Article 1056.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
testator should make a partition of his properties by an act <u>inter</u> <u>vivos</u>,
or by will, such partition shall stand in so far as it does not prejudice the
legitime of the forced heir." (Mang-Oy v. Court of Appeals, 144 SCRA 33
(1986).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this case, nowhere was it alleged nor shown that Leonida
Coronado is entitled to legitime from Melecio Artiaga.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truth of the matter is that the record is
bereft of any showing that Leonida Coronado and the late Melecio Artiaga were
related to each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the third assigned error, CORONADO claims that JUANA is
estopped from questioning the ownership of Leonida Coronado over the land in
question having failed to raise the same in the estate proceedings in the trial
court and even on appeal (Rollo, p. 119).</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is likewise without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Normally, the probate of a will does not look into its intrinsic
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The authentication of a will
decides no other questions than such as touch upon the capacity of the testator
and the compliance with those requisites or solemnities which the law
prescribes for the validity of the wills.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not determine nor even by implication prejudge the validity or
efficiency of the provisions of the will, thus may be impugned as being vicious
or null, notwithstanding its authentication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question relating to these points remain entirely unaffected, and
may be raised even after the will has been authenticated (Manirang, et. al., v.
Court of Appeals, 114 SCRA 473 (1982).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, JUANA is not estopped from questioning the ownership of the
property in question, notwithstanding her having objected to the probate of the
will executed by Monterola under which Leonida Coronado is claiming title to
the said property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the fourth assigned error, it is aIleged by CORONADO that
JUANA's position is weak for want of factual and legal support; the weakness of
JUANA's position lies in the fact that she did not only fail to identify the
subject land, but also failed to explain the discrepancy in the boundary of the
property she is claiming to be hers (Rollo, p. 125).</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is unavailing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that JUANA failed to identify the property in question
and to explain the discrepancy in the boundary of said property, assuming they
are true, is immaterial, in view of the findings of the lower court as to the
identity of the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the lower court found sufficient evidence to support the
conclusion that the property in question is the same property adjudicated to
JUANA under the will of Melecio Artiaga, and that CORONADO has no right
whatsoever to said property (Ibid., p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such findings are conclusive upon this Court (Reynolds Philippine
Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 169 SCRA 220 (1989).</p>
