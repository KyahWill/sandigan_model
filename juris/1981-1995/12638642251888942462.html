<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby MODIFIED in
that the spouses Manuel and <span class="SpellE">Natalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Opulencia</span> are hereby ordered to pay Delta Motors
Corporation the sum of P2,147,162.49 plus interest at the legal rate, back real
estate taxes, and costs, the same to be paid into the Trial Court within <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>period of ninety (90) days from the
date of service of this judgment, and in case of default of such payment, the
properties mortgaged shall be sold in the manner and under the regulations that
govern sales of real estates under execution, the proceeds realized to be
turned over to petitioner Delta Motors Corporation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before us now is private respondent's Motion for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Reconsideration on the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This Hon. Court
sustained the Decision of the Hon. Court of Appeals that the Sheriff's Sale of
April 30, 1980 was improper and unlawful and yet failed to order that the
possession of the property in question be given to the private respondent
considering that the same is now in the possession of the petitioner.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amount of P2<span class="GramE">,147,162.49</span> plus interest at the legal rate which this <st1:street><st1:address>Hon.
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> ordered the private respondent to pay unto
the petitioner is the wrong amount.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“III.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The decision failed
to specify the date from which interest is to be paid.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“IV.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The period of ninety
(90) days given by this <st1:street><st1:address>Hon. Court</st1:address></st1:street>
is much too short."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Private respondent then
prays:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the possession of the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>question

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the amount which private respondent is
being ordered to pay to the petitioner be changed from P2<span class="GramE">,147,162.49</span>
plus interest at the legal rate to P1,644,496.19 plus interest at the legal
rate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this <st1:street><st1:address>Hon. Court</st1:address></st1:street>
order the interest to be paid from <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="8">August
 6, 1979</st1:date>, the date the trial court issued a writ of execution for
the full compromise amount;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this Hon. Court allow private respondent
to pay the amount to the petitioner not within ninety (90) days but within one
hundred eighty (180) days." (p. 5, Motion for Reconsideration of Private
Respondent)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">DELTA has opposed
reconsideration and the OPULENCIAS have replied to the opposition.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It bears repeating what we had stated in our Decision:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be stressed, however, that while irregularities
attended the proceedings concerning the execution sale sufficient to affect the
Writ of Possession which is but a consequence thereof, the OPULENCIAS are bound
by the terms of the Compromise Agreement they had executed on <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="8">23 August 1978</st1:date> and approved by the
Trial Court on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="11">29 November 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be allowed to renege on the same
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> .</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is still
incumbent upon the OPULENCIAS to pay their judgment obligation to DELTA plus
interest at the legal rate and back real estate taxes paid thus far." (p.
10, Decision)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although, ordinarily, possession may be turned over to the
OPULENCIAS in view of the finding of this Court that irregularities attended
the proceedings concerning the execution sale, considering, however, that under
the Court-approved Compromise Agreement of the parties, it is incumbent upon
private respondent to pay their obligation to DELTA, it would serve no
practical purpose and would only delay the prompt determination of this
controversy were we to order the turn-over of possession to the OPULENCIAS,
who, under the terms of the judgment, are given ninety (90) days from notice
within which to pay the indebtedness, and in case of default of such payment,
the properties mortgaged shall be sold in the manner governing sales of real
properties under execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is crucial, therefore, is for the OPULENCIAS to pay the
obligation within the 90-day period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
they do so, then possession of the mortgaged properties can definitively and
finally be turned over to them and the controversy settled once and for
all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But if possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is turned over to the OPULENCIAS at this
stage and it should turn out that the OPULENCIAS are unable to settle their
obligation, they would have been able to regain possession even without paying
their obligation, which would be unjust to the judgment creditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is specially so considering that the
obligation was incurred in 1970 and has remained unpaid from 1978 when the
Compromise Agreement was entered into, till the present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We consider the period of ninety (90) days just and reasonable
considering the length of time - the ten (10)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> odd years - <span class="GramE">that</span> the obligation has remained
pending.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it gives the
OPULENCIAS a fresh period within which to settle their long-standing
indebtedness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the manifestation that the amount of P2<span class="GramE">,147,162.49</span> already includes interest, the sum to be paid by
the OPULENCIAS is modified to P1,644,496.16, which is their judgment debt
pursuant to the Compromise Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The twelve per cent (12%) annual interest on said amount, as stipulated
in the Compromise Agreement, should be reckoned from the date the Trial Court
issued the Writ of Execution, or, from <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="8">6
 August 1979</st1:date>.</p>
