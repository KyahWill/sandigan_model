<p class="BODY">As found by respondent court, petitioner was the Grains Stock
Control Officer (GSCO) in charge of the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
Warehouse and the NSDC Warehouse respectively located in <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pontevedra</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The practice in said warehouses was that
incoming rice stocks are issued Warehouse Stock Receipts (WSR) and outgoing
stocks are issued Warehouse Stock Issues (WSI).</p>

<p class="BODY">Private complainant Reynaldo R. <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span>
was the owner and operator of the <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span> in San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> which was duly licensed by the NFA to mill its <span class="SpellE">palay</span> stocks under contracts duly executed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
also a vessel contractor engaged in the transfer of NFA milled rice from his
rice mill or NFA warehouse to the pier site for shipment to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In February, 1982, NFA Auditor Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Gacrama</span>
conducted an audit examination of <span class="SpellE">Banayos</span>'
accountability for rice stocks and empty sacks comprising the period from <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1981</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination initially showed a shortage
of 126.5 bags of rice in petitioner's liquidation report and which shortage <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> promptly settled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, based on petitioner's footnotes in his August 16-23, 1981 Stock
Report for the NSDC Warehouse, it appeared that <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>
Nos. 137290-92 were erroneously credited with <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span>
Nos. 47570-72, hence <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> had a shortage of 570
bags of rice worth P103,734.14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A demand
letter for restitution, dated <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1982</st1:date> was served on <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1983, as a result of a request for re-audit by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> who claimed that he had accounted for the alleged
missing stocks which he had actually shipped to <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City, COA Legal Officer Rudy M. <span class="SpellE">Villareña</span> submitted
an investigation report<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
to NFA Corporate Auditor Eduardo Gomez wherein he recommended that <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92 reflecting 570 bags of rice, together
with the replacement cost of 570 empty sacks, be credited to <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> inasmuch as said <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> had
not really been cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said report
further recommended that appropriate action be initiated against petitioner as
GSCO in charge of the NSDC and <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> warehouses for
the latter's failure to comply properly with the procedure in the cancellation
of accountable documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Auditor Gomez then ordered in his memorandum<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1983</st1:date> that <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> be credited with the 570 bags of rice disallowed in
audit and to debit said account against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was elevated by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> to Chairman Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>,
Jr. of the Commission on Audit who, on October 31, 1985,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
upheld Gomez’ ruling based on the unequivocal admission of petitioner in his
certification, dated November 19, 1981, that <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>
Nos. 137290-92 were never actually cancelled,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and which he further affirmed in another certification dated November 27, 1982.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Based thereon, <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> was refunded the amount of
P54,750.78 which he had theretofore paid under protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court further ascertained that the 570 bags of milled
rice covered by <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92 of the NSDC
Warehouse issued by Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>, NFA Milling
Supervisor, were shipped or transferred to <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> under the "Technical-In and
Technical-Out" (TITO) procedure whereby <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
stock withdrawn by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> from the NSDC Warehouse
was milled in the <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span>
and, instead of being returned to the NSDC Warehouse, by-passed it and was
brought in delivery trucks to the pier and loaded on the M/L "Seven
Seas" for transport and delivery to NFA <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
on June 19, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bill of lading was
also prepared by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> and, thereafter, the
corresponding <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 475470-72 were recorded in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> and which should also be for the
NSDC Warehouse.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos.
137290-92 appeared to have been cancelled without the consent of higher
authorities and the same 570 bags of milled rice were recorded in the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Warehouse under <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos.
139491-93 and <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 478487-89.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Although petitioner contends that <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 139491-93
were mere replacements of <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92,
actually the copies of the auditor, miller-contractor, handler and GSCO of <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92 were not cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As GSCO in charge of both the NSDC and <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> warehouses, it is petitioner who cancels the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> and delivers the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
stocks to the <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> <span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span>,
and the milling supervisor, Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>, receives
the same and prepares and signs the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> and <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits that what was actually involved was an
erroneous documentation which resulted in the cancellation of the accounting
copies of <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92, with the corresponding
<span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 475470­-72 representing 570 bags of rice,
which were allegedly improperly cancelled in the record of the NSDC Warehouse
and were merely replaced by <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 139491-93, with
the corresponding <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 478487-89, for the same
number of bags of rice and the same net weight in kilos in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He alleged that it was <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> who prepares the
<span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> and the <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> when <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> delivers the stocks of rice from his <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span> to the designated warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason, according to him, why the name of
the warehouse where he was assigned appeared in the documents prepared by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> was because it was used as a reference or imaginary
warehouse for the management to know the flow of stocks.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He claimed that on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="6">June
 19, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> made a delivery and
made a claim for trucking freight and for credit in such delivery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on July 25, 1981 no delivery was
made by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> to NFA, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as allegedly shown by the certification of its Provincial Manager <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> issued on <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Continuing, he avers that in the third week of July, 1981, he met <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> in the NFA, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> at <span class="SpellE">Balo</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and the latter told him about
an error he made in the documentation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> allegedly said that he used the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> of the NSDC Warehouse instead of using
the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Warehouse documents. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The stock actually involved was the stock of <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Warehouse and not that of NSDC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They both allegedly went to the office of NFA
Provincial Manager Benjamin Marta who was then out, hence they went to the
office of Auditor <span class="SpellE">Gacrama</span> for advice on the error in
documentation.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Gacrama</span> purportedly instructed <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>
to cancel the NSDC documents (<span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92) at
the accounting office and to replace the same with the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has no knowledge
as to whether or not the other copies of said NSDC documents were cancelled by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> as instructed by <span class="SpellE">Gacrama</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admits that on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1981</st1:date>, he executed a certification that the
NSDC Warehouse did receive 570 bags of rice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He further claims that he made the certification forgetting the
cancellation of the accounting copies of <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos.
137290-92 in July of that year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
allegedly based the certification on the GSCO copies which were not cancelled
by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Parenthetically, he had previously said that the stocks were supposed to be
delivered to the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> Warehouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benjamin Marta, presented by the defense, testified that the
procedure adopted at that time by the NFA when the <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span>
is far from the office was the "Technical-In and Technical-Out"
(TITO) system, which meant that the stocks did not actually go to the
warehouse; instead, from a particular warehouse it goes direct to where it is
to be delivered, so "TITO" is the term used to specify or emphasize a
transaction which is purely documentary.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He amplified his testimony, as hereunder summarized by respondent
court:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
accused was his former GSCO and as such, he was the one in-charge of the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and the NSDC warehouses, while Eduardo<span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> was the
Milling Supervisor assigned at the <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span> by the milling management who oversee(s) the
operation of the <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span>, keep(s) records of stocks
and receipt issues, prepare(s) and sign(s) documents such as the WSR and
WSI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He knows Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> who was then designated as milling contractor of
the NFA and as such, he was responsible for the withdrawal of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> for milling from the NFA warehouse and delivers the
expected recoveries of rice to a designated warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from being a milling contractor, <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> was also a vessel contractor who undertook the transfer
of rice from his <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span> to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bacolod</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and to the pier site utilizing his
trucks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span>
was far from their office, they adopt the Technical-In and the Technical-Out
system which was utilized for purposes of economical operation, time saving and
effort saving and to trace or monitor the stocks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The system was used when the stocks of rice
come from the <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span> and transported to the
vessel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the stocks are loaded on a
particular vessel, a bill of lading is prepared by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>
indicating therein the volume of rice, the quantity and its destination and
signed by <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> as shipper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stocks are reflected in the WSR and the
original is given to the miller for liquidation while the other copies are
distributed to the auditing and accounting office and to end-users.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the stocks are placed inside the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and NSDC warehouses, the accused would be the one
to sign the documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="6"><span style="">June 19,
 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, there was a
delivery made by <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> <span class="SpellE">ricemill</span>
to the NFA and the one who prepared the WSR and WSI was Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He further explained that the reason why several copies of the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> had to be distributed was because it was part of the
internal control of the NFA and if there is only one copy of the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>, once lost they would not have any other
reference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when there was a
necessity for the correction of errors that the <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>
are cancelled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If only the accounting
copy is cancelled and the others are not, it becomes a questionable document
and the one who made the cancellation will have to explain.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated at the outset, respondent court handed down a judgment
convicting petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further struck
down petitioner's motion for reconsideration in its resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1990</st1:date>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We
are of the considered opinion that accused had not met frontally the charge
described in the information and which was clearly and positively proven by the
<span style="">prosecution's evidence that he was an
accountable officer as Grains Stock Control Officer (GSCO) and In-Charge of the
<span class="SpellE"><u>Barredo</u></span> and <u>NSDC</u> Warehouses, and that
there was a shortage in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Barredo</u></span> Warehouse,
stock accountabilities arising out of the irregular, improper and unjustified
cancellation of the accounting copies of WSR Nos. 137290 to 137292 of <u>NSDC</u>
stocks and replacing them with <span class="SpellE"><u>Barredo</u></span> <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> and <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As accountable officer of both warehouses,
accused bears the primary liability for any shortage arising in either
warehouse and cannot exempt himself <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by
attributing the shortage to the illegal manipulations of <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as accused had not been able to
explain satisfactorily why there was a shortage in his accountabilities, then
his liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> must be adjudged."

<p class="BODY">The petition clearly indicates that petitioner questions the
conclusions of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> insofar as its appreciation
of the evidence and the facts is concerned, thereby relying on the exceptions
to the rule that our appellate review is generally limited to questions of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that the exceptive
situations invoked by petitioner are not present in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> relied on the fact
that the <span class="SpellE">ricemiller</span>, <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span>,
was able to account for the 570 bags of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> from
the NSDC warehouse under <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92 and was,
in fact, subsequently issued a <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 475470-72
which conclusively showed that he was no longer accountable for the rice
stocks.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>while
admitting that he was the GSCO in charge of the NSDC and the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> warehouses, points to Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>,
the NFA milling supervisor, as the one responsible for the error in
documentation which resulted in the questioned cancellation of only the
accounting copies of the NSDC <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
however, correctly appreciated the fact that petitioner allowed <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span>, as the milling supervisor assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and NSDC warehouses which were under petitioner's
custody and responsibility, to cancel the accounting copies of NSDC <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-92 without <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
<span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 475470-72, and replace them with the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 478487-89.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Logically, therefore, the <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
warehouse would not and should not reflect any shortage if such cancellation
was indeed correctly made only because of clerical errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact is that petitioner's own "Consolidated Summary of
Rice Accountability of <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> Rice Mill, San Nicolas,
<span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, covering
January 29, 1981 to September 30, 1981"<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
showed that NFA, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City received the 570 bags
covered by <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> Nos. 137290-­92 with the
corresponding <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> Nos. 475470-72 of the NSDC
warehouse, per Bill of Lading No. 005071.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, respondent court correctly concluded that petitioner and <span class="SpellE">Berebe</span> knew that the supposed erroneous documentation was
not true and the replacement of the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span>
and <span class="SpellE">WSIs</span> was irregular and unauthorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, under the "TITO"
arrangement, there was no actual transfer or custody of stock but only
paperwork was involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner failed to satisfactorily explain away the
existence and significance of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
certification he issued on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1981</st1:date> wherein he attested to the receipt by the NSDC Warehouse
of 570 bags of rice from <span class="SpellE">Badayos</span> in this manner:</p>
