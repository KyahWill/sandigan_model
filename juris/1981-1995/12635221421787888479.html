This Petition for <em>Certiorari </em>questions a March 29, 1979 
Decision rendered by the then Court of First Instance of Pasay City.  
The Decision was one made on memoranda, pursuant to the provisions of RA
 6031, and it modified, on October 17, 1977, a judgment of the then 
Municipal Court of Parañaque, Rizal, in an Ejectment suit instituted by 
herein petitioner Leonila SARMIENTO against private respondends, the 
spouses ERNESTO Valentino and Rebecca Lorenzo.  For the facts, 
therefore, we have to look to the evidence presented by the parties at 
the original level.
<p>
It appears that while ERNESTO was still courting his wife, the latter's 
mother had told him the couple could build a RESIDENTIAL HOUSE on a lot 
of 145 sq. ms., being Lot D of a subdivision in Parañaque (the LAND, for
 short).  In 1967, ERNESTO did construct a RESIDENTIAL HOUSE on the LAND
 at a cost of P8,000.00 to P10,000.00.  It was probably assumed that the
 wife's mother was the owner of the LAND and that, eventually, it would 
somehow be transferred to the spouses.
</p><p>
It subsequently turned out that the LAND had been titled in the name of 
Mr. &amp; Mrs. Jose C. Santos, Jr. who, on September 7, 1974, sold the 
same to petitioner SARMIENTO.  The following January 6, 1975, SARMIENTO 
asked ERNESTO and wife to vacate and, on April 21, 1975, filed an 
Ejectment suit against them.  In the evidentiary hearings before the 
Municipal Court, SARMIENTO submitted the deed of sale of the LAND in her
 favor, which showed the price to be P15,000.00.  On the other hand, 
ERNESTO testified that the then cost of the RESIDENTIAL HOUSE would be 
from P30,000.00 to P40,000.00.  The figures were not questioned by 
SARMIENTO.
</p><p>
The Municipal Court found that private respondents had built the 
RESIDENTIAL HOUSE in good faith, and, disregarding the testimony of 
ERNESTO, that it had a value of P20,000.00.  It then ordered ERNESTO and
 wife to vacate the LAND after SARMIENTO has paid them the mentioned sum
 of P20,000.00.
</p><p>
The Ejectment suit was elevated to the Court of First Instance of Pasay 
where, after the submission of memoranda, said Court rendered a 
modifying Decision under Article 448 of the Civil Code.  SARMIENTO was 
required, within 60 days, to exercise the option to reimburse ERNESTO 
and wife the sum of P40,000.00 as the value of the RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, or
 the option to allow them to purchase the  LAND for P25,000.00.  
SARMIENTO did not exercise any of the two options within the indicated 
period, and ERNESTO was then allowed to deposit the sum of P25,000.00 
with the Court as the purchase price for the LAND.  This is the hub of 
the controversy.  SARMIENTO then instituted the instant <em>Certiorari </em>proceedings.
</p><p>
We agree that ERNESTO and wife were builders in good faith in view of 
the peculiar circumstances under which they had constructed the 
RESIDENTIAL HOUSE.  As far as they knew, the LAND was owned by ERNESTO's
 mother-in-law who, having stated they could build on the property, 
could reasonably be expected to later on give them the LAND.
</p><p>
In regards to builders in good faith, Article 448 of the Code provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ART. 448.  The owner of the land on which anything has been build, sown or planted in good faith,<br>
    shall have the right<br>
    to appropriate as his own the works, sowing or planting, after 
payment of the indemnity provided for in articles 546 and 548, or
    <br>
    to oblige the one who built or planted to pay the price of the land, and the one who sowed, the proper rent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, the builder or planter cannot be obliged to buy the land if its
 value is considerably more than that of the building or trees.  In such
 case, he shall pay reasonable rent, if the owner of the land does not 
choose to appropriate the building or trees after proper indemnity.  The
 parties shall agree upon the terms of the lease and in case of 
disagreement, the court shall fix the terms thereof." (Paragraphing 
supplied)
</p><p>
The value of the LAND, purchased for P15,000.00 on September 7, 1974, 
could not have been very much more than that amount during the following
 January when ERNESTO and wife were asked to vacate.  However, ERNESTO 
and wife have not questioned the P25,000.00 valuation determined by the 
Court of First Instance.
</p><p>
In regards to the valuation of the RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, the only evidence 
presented was the testimony of ERNESTO that its worth at the time of the
 trial should be from P30,000.00 to P40,000.00.  The Municipal Court 
chose to assess its value at P20,000.00, or below the minimum testified 
by ERNESTO, while the Court of First Instance chose the maximum of 
P40,000.00.  In the latter case, it cannot be said that the Court of 
First Instance had abused its discretion.
</p><p>
The challenged decision of respondent Court, based on valuations of 
P25,000.00 for the LAND and P40,000.00 for the RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, cannot
 be viewed as not supported by the evidence.  The provision for the 
exercise by petitioner SARMIENTO of either the option to indemnify 
private respondents in the amount of P40,000.00, or the option to allow 
private respondents to purchase the LAND at P25,000.00, in our opinion, 
was a correct decision.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The owner of the building erected in good faith on a land owned 
by another, is entitled to retain the possession of the land until he is
 paid the value of his building, under article 453 (now Article 546).  
The owner of the land, upon the other hand, has the option, under 
article 361 (now Article 448), either to pay for the building or to sell
 his land to the owner of the building.  <em>But he cannot,</em> as respondents here did, r<em>efuse both to pay for the building and to sell the land </em>and
 compel the owner of the building to remove it from the land where it is
 erected.  He is entitled to such remotion only when, after having 
chosen to sell his land, the other party fails to pay for the same.  
(underscoring ours) </p>
  <p> "We hold, therefore, that the order of Judge Natividad compelling 
defendants-petitioners to remove their buildings from the land belonging
 to plaintiffs-respondents only because the latter chose neither to pay 
for such buildings nor to sell the land, is null and void, for it amends
 substantially the judgment sought to be executed and is, furthermore, 
offensive to articles 361 (now Article 448) and 453 (now Article 546) of
 the Civil Code." (Ignacio vs. Hilario, 76 Phil. 605, 608 [1946]). </p>

<p>
WHEREFORE, the Petition for <em>Certiorari </em>is hereby ordered dismissed, without pronouncement as to costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.

<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Plana, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr., </em>and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.</em>, concur.
