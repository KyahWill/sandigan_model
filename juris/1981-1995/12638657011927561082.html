				<H3>COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF TAX APPEALS AND EVERETT STEAMSHIP CORPO­RATION (AS OWNER OF THE SS "FERNANDO EVERETT"), RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The "Fernando Everett", a vessel owned by private
respondent Everett Steamship Corporation arrived on 23 April 1969 in the Port
of Manila and there discharged a shipment of fifty (50) bales of assorted
textile remnants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The gross weight of
the shipment as declared in the vessel's Manifest and in Bill of Lading No.
N-20-M was 17,500 pounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
examination and appraisal by Customs authorities, the actual weight of the
shipment was found to be 62,869 <span class="GramE">pounds,</span> or 45,369
pounds more than the declared weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated 9 July 1969, the Chief of the Law Division of
the Bureau of Customs informed the Everett Steamship Corporation of the
discrepancy between the actual weight and the declared weight of the shipment
of textile remnants, said discrepancy being more than twenty percent (20%) of
the declared weight, and required the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> to
explain the discrepancy in writing within five (5) days from receipt of the
letter and to show cause why no administrative fine should be imposed upon the
"Fernando Everett" for violation of Section 2523 of the Tariff and
Customs Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
replied that the "Fernando <st1:city><st1:place>Everett</st1:place></st1:city>"
was not liable for violation of the Tariff and Customs Code because the
particulars of the subject shipment, including the weight thereof, were
supplied by the shipper.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously dissatisfied with the <span class="SpellE">shipowner's</span>
explanation, the Bureau of Customs initiated an administrative proceeding
(Administrative Case No. 493-49) against the "Fernando Everett".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon termination of this proceeding, the
Collector of Customs rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="11">8 November 1974</st1:date> finding the "Fernando Everett"
or its owner liable for a fine of P22<span class="GramE">,617.00</span>
representing fifteen percent (15%) of the total value of the shipment, for
violation of Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 2523 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 2523.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Discrepancy between
actual &amp; declared weight of manifested article</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- If the <u>gross weight</u> of any article
or package described in the manifest <u>exceed by more than twenty per centum
the gross weight as declared</u> in the manifest or bill of lading thereof, <u>and
the Collector shall be of the opinion that such discrepancy was due to the
carelessness or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> of the master or pilot
in command, owner or employee of the vessel</u> or aircraft, a <u>fine of not
more than fifteen per centum of the value</u> of the package or article in
respect to which the discrepancy exists, may be imposed upon the importing
vessel or aircraft." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>, the
Commissioner of Customs affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
the decision of the Collector of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Everett Steamship Corporation then went to the Court of Tax
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="1">23 January 1978</st1:date>, the Court of Tax
Appeals agreed with the Commissioner of Customs that the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
had violated Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code, but reduced the fine
from P22<span class="GramE">,617.00</span> to P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner Commissioner of Customs is now before us on a
Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> asking for modification of the
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals and for reinstatement of the fine of P22<span class="GramE">,617.00</span> imposed by the Commissioner of Customs against
private respondent <span class="SpellE">ship­owner</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Examination of the record reveals that three
(3) issues are raised in this Petition:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there is a duty on the part of
the captain of a vessel or of a <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> to
determine the true weight of cargo to be loaded on board the vessel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the discrepancy in the instant
case between the actual and the declared weight of the shipment involved was
due to the carelessness or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> of the
captain of the vessel; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>What is the proper scope of the authority of
the Commissioner of Customs to determine the amount of the fine imposable under
Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs <span class="GramE">Code.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the first issue, private respondent <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> argues that Articles 612 and 632 of the Code of
Commerce specifying the duties of the captain, the second mate and chief
engineer of a vessel, do not require the checking of the actual weight of the
cargo loaded on board the vessel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>, moreover, insists that the Tariff and Customs
Code similarly does not impose such a duty upon the captain of the vessel or
the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">These arguments do not persuade; they have already been
considered and rejected by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>Commissioner of Customs v. Court of Tax Appeals and Delgado
Shipping Agencies</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that a duty of verifying the correct weight of a cargo shipment
<u>is</u> imposed by Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code itself:</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, contrary
to respondent's contention, <u>the vessel's master, owner or employee are duty
bound under the cited <span class="SpellE">codal</span> section</u> under pain of
the penalty of fine therein provided <u>to check and verify the correct weight
of the cargo or shipment</u> so as to prevent a <span class="SpellE">misdeclaration</span>
or <span class="SpellE">underdeclaration</span> of weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vessel master's discharge of such <u>obligation
imposed by law to properly determine and verify the weight of cargos carried by
it</u> is certainly <u>pertinent to and important for the proper assessment of
the collectible customs duties and taxes</u>, and is not a burdensome task in
the present era of containerized cargos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In <u>Commissioner of Customs v. Delgado
Shipping Agency and the Court of Tax Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court reiterated very recently that a vessel's master, owner or employees
are indeed burdened with the duty "to check and verify the correct weight
of its cargo".</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the second issue, the Everett Steamship Corporation
contends that for a violation of Section 2523 to arise, two (2) elements must
occur, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the actual gross
weight of any article or package must exceed the declared gross weight by more
than twenty percent (20%) of the stated weight; and (b) the discrepancy must be
affirmatively shown to have been due to the carelessness or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span>
of the master, owner or employees of the vessel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears to the Court that private respondent <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> has selectively read Section 2523.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What Section 2523 does provide is this:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"[A]<span class="SpellE">nd</span> the
Collector shall be of the opinion that such discrepancy was due to the careless­ness
or <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> of the master or pilot in command,
owner or employee of the vessel or aircraft".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A difference of more than twenty percent
(20%) between the actual gross weight of a shipment and its declared gross
weight is not a <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>minimis</u></span> matter; on
the contrary, it is sufficiently substantial so as reasonably to give rise to a
presumption <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>tantum</u></span>
that some negligence or failure to exercise some technical duty had
occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The actual practice of the
Commissioner of Customs in cases of this kind may be seen to be based upon such
presumption; where a discrepancy of more than twenty percent (20%) of the
stated weight is shown, the Collector of Customs requires, as noted earlier,
the vessel, its captain or owner to show cause why an administrative fine
should not be imposed upon the offending vessel under Section 2523 of the
Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The greater the
discrepancy between declared gross weight and actual gross weight of a shipment,
the stronger that presumption becomes until at some point it is well-nigh
conclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the
"Fernando Everett", the discrepancy amounted to <u>259</u> per centum
of the declared gross weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given that
level of discrepancy, there must have been either gross negligence amounting to
bad faith, or obvious incompetence, on the part of the captain of the vessel or
the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> or its employees in failing to detect
the gross <span class="SpellE">underdeclaration</span> of the weight of the
shipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the situation at hand, it
is incumbent upon the captain of the vessel or the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
to show the presence of some adequate exculpatory circumstance, rather than for
the Customs authority to prove affirmatively that there was carelessness or
professional or technical ineptness on the part of the ship captain or the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> or its employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of the "Fernando Everett", no exculpatory
circumstances were shown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> sought to shift the blame to the
shipper who had supplied the declared weight of the shipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To permit the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
to absolve itself of responsibility on that <span class="GramE">basis,</span>
would be effectively to render Section 2523 quite inutile.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Addressing the third issue relating to the authority of the
Commissioner of Customs to determine the amount of fine imposable under Section
2523, the Court would stress that that authority is lodged in the Collector of
Customs and the Commissioner of Customs and <u>not</u> either in the Court of
Tax Appeals or this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner of Customs required the Everett Steamship Corporation to pay the
maximum imposable fine amounting to fifteen percent (15%) of the value of the
shipment involved -- i.e., P22<span class="GramE">,617.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent Court of Tax Appeals
was not warranted in substituting its judgment for that of the Commissioner of
Customs as to the amount of the fine properly imposable in the circumstances of
this case, unless, of course, a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
Commissioner of Customs had been shown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, no such grave abuse of discretion -- no merely
arbitrary and capricious exercise of power -- on the part of the Commissioner
of Customs was shown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax
Appeals simply felt that the fifteen percent (15%) fine was "harsh and
unreason­able" stating that this was the first offense of the
"Fernando Everett" under Section 2523.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, no mitigating circumstances were pleaded
by the Everett Steamship Corporation that would rationally have justified the
Commissioner of Customs in imposing a fine less than the maximum statutory
fine.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reaching this conclusion, we have taken particular account of
the vitally important nature of the public policy which is sought to be
promoted by Section 2523 of the Tariff and Customs Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That public policy, which should be reinforced
and strengthened rather than eroded and enfeebled, was underscored by the Court
in <u>Commissioner of Customs v. Court of Tax Appeals and Delgado Shipping
Agencies</u> in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>The clear
purpose of the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provision</u> requiring vessels to
declare the correct weight of their cargo <u>is to curb smuggling due to such <span class="SpellE">underdeclarations</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <u>imposing the maximum fine on vessels which grossly fail to
comply with the obligation to declare the true weight of their cargo promotes
the spirit and purpose of the law</u>, since <u>imposing a minimum fine would
only embolden would-be smugglers and foster gross negligence on the part of the
master of the vessel as in this case in checking the true weight of the cargo</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents' claim that there could be no
evasion of duties here since textile remnants are imposed duties <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>valorem</u></span> or on the basis of the dutiable value of the
merchandise irrespective of the weight is untenable, since an <span class="SpellE">underdeclaration</span> of the weight of the remnants by more than
400% would make it much easier to <span class="SpellE">underdeclare</span> the
dutiable value of the remnants."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court Resolved to GRANT due course to the
Petition for Review and to MODIFY the Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals dated
23 January 1978 by reinstating the administrative fine of P22,617.00 imposed by

Under Section 3 (3) (b) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Public Act No.
521, 74th Congress of the United States; made applicable to the Philippines by
Commonwealth Act No. 65), the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> issues to the
shipper a bill of lading showing, among other things, "either the number
of packages or pieces, or the quantity or <u>weight</u>, as the case may be, as
furnished in writing by the shipper." Under Section 3 (5), <i><u>id</u></i>.,
the shipper is deemed to have guaranteed to the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
the accuracy at the time of shipment of the weight (and other details) of such
shipment as furnished by the shipper and the shipper is required to indemnify
the carrier against loss, damages and expenses arising from inaccuracies in
such particulars.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The provision,
however, goes on to state that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<u>the
