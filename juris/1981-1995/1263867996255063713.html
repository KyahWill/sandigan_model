virtue of, among others, the orders dated October 24 and 25, 1989 of respondent
judge ordering the implementation of an alias Writ of Execution dated 21 March
1989 and the Writ of Execution dated 21 March 1986; and claiming that what was

<p class="BODY">In his Comment the Solicitor General maintains that the <span style="">SRA </span>has no legal personality to file
the instant petition in the name of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for under its charter, Executive Order No. 18, the SRA is not vested with legal
capacity to sue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further argues that
the <span style="">SRA </span>was not a party to the
court-approved compromise agreement <span style="">in </span>Civil
Case No. 86-35880 which provided for the questioned 10% attorney's fees;
PHILSUCOM and NASUTRA, which were parties thereto, did not file any action to
annul the compromise agreement; that while Executive Order No. 18 abolished the
PHILSUCOM, the latter's juridical personality was to continue for three (3)
years, during which period it may prosecute and defend suits against it; and
that, finally, even if SRA has the capacity to sue, it cannot still bring any
action on behalf of the Republic of the Philippines as this can be done only by
the Office of the Solicitor General per Section 1 of P.D. No. 478.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General likewise stresses that the interest of the
national government in this case is confined only to the amount remaining in
RPB subject to legal subrogation; the judgment on the compromise agreement had
long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; and that no
reversible error was committed by respondent judge and respondent Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents assert that the SRA and <span style="">RPB </span>do not have the legal authority to
sue for and in behalf of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In respect to the former, their conclusion is
supported <span style="">by </span>almost the same
arguments as that asserted by the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the RPB, they maintain that it <span style="">"is </span>a
government-controlled corporation engaged in the banking business with
corporate powers vested in a Board of Directors," hence, it is
"legally untenable for such a banking institution, even assuming that it
is government-controlled, to initiate suits for and in behalf of the Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
(p. 171, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They further argued that petitioners have no legal personality to
initiate the instant petition for (a) SRA is not a party in the case before the
trial court; the only reason why it became involved was because of the contempt
proceedings initiated by private respondents against <span class="SpellE">SRA's</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> for issuing Sugar Orders No. 9 and 14; and that
neither can it be presumed that SRA had substituted defendants PHILSUCOM and
the NASUTRA in the case as both continue to legally exist for the purpose of
prosecuting and defending suits <span style="">in </span>liquidation
of its affairs; both did not file any petition for relief from judgment
questioning the validity of the judgment of the trial court approving the
compromise agreement; and that, moreover, RPB was a signatory to the Compromise
Agreement as a Trustee and, <span style="">as </span>such, it regarded itself as only a nominal party and in a
series of pleadings it recognized the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
nature of the decision approving the compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second assigned error, private respondents pointed out
that the Ninth Division of the Court of Appeals did not rule in C.A.-G.R No.
11046 that Civil Case No. 86-35880 before the trial court was not a class suit,
and whether or not it was a class suit <span style="">was </span>not an issue therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="1">15 January 1990</st1:date>

"wherein they informed the Court that despite the temporary restraining
order issued on 26 October 1989, respondent Judge, to whom the Order was addressed,
continued to hear the case, particularly on the whereabouts of 177,087.14 <span class="SpellE">piculs</span> of sugar for the crop year 1984-1985 allegedly

We required respondent judge to show cause why no disciplinary action should be
taken against her for failure to comply with the resolution of 26 October 1989

legal action pursuant to P.D. No. 478.<span style="">&nbsp;

the government office adversely affected by the position taken by the Solicitor

need not be represented by the Office of the Solicitor General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may appear in its own behalf through its
legal personnel or representative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question that
logically crops up then is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>May it be
represented by the OGCC?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
hold the negative view.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
maintain otherwise, for the reason that pursuant to Section 1 of the charter of
the OGCC (P.D. No. 1415), as they quoted, the Office of the President, through
the Executive Secretary, has authorized </span>it <span style="">to represent the SRA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
specific basis for such authority is the alleged portion of the <span class="SpellE">exceptionary</span> clause therein, </span>reading "x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>authorized</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>President</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The words <u>or</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>authorized</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u>

law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">We are </span><span style="">not aware of any law, decree or executive order which amended Section 1
of P.D. No. 1415 by inserting therein said words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, even granting for the </span><span style="">sake </span><span style="">of argument that such words are written into
the l</span>aw, <span style="">such </span>exception
cannot confer <span style="">upon the OGCC authority
to represent the SRA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception
simply means that although the OGCC </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the principal law office of all government-owned and controlled
corporations including their subsidiaries, the President may not allow it to
act as lawyer for a specified government-owned or controlled corporation or a
subsidiary thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted
that under Section </span>1 <span style="">of P.D. No.
478 the President may authorize the OSG to represent </span>government-owned or
controlled <span style="">corporations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the </span>exception limits, rather
than expands, the authority of the OGCC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the so-called approval by the Executive Secretary of the request
of OGCC to represent the SRA is based on an erroneous interpretation of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, even if we grant that there was such an exception,
as well construed in the manner urged by petitioners, it must be deemed,
nevertheless, to have been repealed by the Administrative Code of 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 10, Chapter 3, Title III, Book IV thereof
on the Office of the Government Corporate counsel does not contain the
purported exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads:</p>

maintained separately and such powers and functions as are now or may hereafter

such control or supervision, the Government Corporate Counsel shall promulgate
rules and regulations to effectively implement the objectives of the
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the SRA is neither <span style="">a

OGCC does not have the authority to represent it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to who may represent it, the <span class="SpellE"><u>Orbos</u></span> case<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The case of the RPB is, however, different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted to be a government-owned
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The OGCC can, therefore,
legally represent RPB in actions filed by or against it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, this issue was not
categorically and expressly addressed by the Court of Appeals and has not been
raised in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, even if
We have to rule that <span class="SpellE">OGCC's</span> appearance for the RPB in
the petition before the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 17188 was proper, the
result would be the same -- dismissal of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As also correctly pointed out by the Court of
Appeals, having received benefits by way of trustee's fees, the R<span style="">PB </span>may not question the right of
private respondents to attorney's fees; its only obligation under the judgment

was not in any way based thereon or influenced by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the Court categorically
stated that it was premature to rule on that issue because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition for relief from judgment and
interventions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">full disquisition of the Court of Appeals on
this point reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the outset, let it be stated that the incidents which
arose from the class suit before the respondent court are predominantly related
to the ten percent (10%) attorney's fees stipulated in the compromise agreement
approved by the respondent court in its June 2, 1986 judgment in favor of
petitioner's counsels Atty. Roger Z. Reyes, Ernesto L. <span class="SpellE">Treyes</span>,
Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Eutiquio</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Fudolin</span>,
Jr.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the said 'class suit', only the five original plaintiffs and
producers <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>,
for himself and in representation of <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Mascuraña</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> per Special Power of Attorney, and Ernesto Kramer
represented by Atty. Roger Z. Reyes per Special Power of Attorney, have
authorized said Attys. Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Treyes</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Fudolin</span>, Jr. to represent them as counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On page 18 of the instant petition, petitioners allege that 'there
is no necessity to secure Special Powers of Attorney from the unnamed parties
in <span style="">a </span>class
suit, and the failure of petitioners' counsel to do so does not constitute
fraud, the named parties having contest over the class suit.' By such
statement, petitioners and their counsels admit their lack of authority from
the rest of the alleged 40,000 sugar producers to file the class suit and enter
into the compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 12, Rule 3, Revised Rules of Court provides that in order
that one or more may sue for the benefit of others as a class suit, it is
necessary that 'the court shall make sure that the parties actually before it <span style="">are <u>sufficiently</u> <u>numerous</u> <u>and</u>
<u>representative</u> so that all interests are fully protected.' (<span class="SpellE">Dimayuga</span>, et al. vs. CIR, et al., G.R. No. L-10213, </span><st1:date year="1957" day="27" month="5"><span style="">May 27,
 1957</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>For that matter, in the case below, therein plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rosendo</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Rama</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bibiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> filed
with the respondent court a motion to partially annul decision and/or petition
for relief against <span style="">the </span>said ten <span style="">(10%) </span>percent attorney's <span style="">fees on the allegation that they </span>were <span style="">deceived into signing the compromise
agreement believing, as was agreed upon during the negotiations, that the ten
(10%) percent of whatever would be collected would go to a trust fund for the
benefit of the sugar farmers and producers and not as attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, petition for relief was filed by
thirteen other alleged sugar producers principally on </span>the <span style="">ground that the compromise agreement entered
into was without their express authority by way of Special Power of Attorney
and that the class suit was unnecessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of these sugar producers are the <span class="SpellE">Associacion</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Agricultores</span> de la Region <span class="SpellE">Oesta</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Inc. (AAROB) with 742 members; the <span class="SpellE">Samahang</span> <span class="SpellE">Mag-aasukal</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kanluran</span> <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
(SAMAKABA) with 4,000 members and Independent Sugar Farmers, Inc. with 200
members.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Here is a situation, as pointed out by respondent NASUTRA and SRA,
where petitioners in filing the class suit claim to represent 40,000 sugar
producers all over the country and yet when some of these producers filed
petition for relief and interventions, petitioners 'disowned' them, stating
that the other sugar producers have no personality to intervene, not having
been named parties to <span style="">the class suit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It should not be overlooked that the said sugar producers, although
not named parties in the class suit, are the very alleged persons represented
in the class suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They certainly have
interests in the subject matter of the controversy; in the contents of the
compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The filing of petitions for relief from judgment has not been
prohibited by B.P. 129.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy of
petitions for relief from judgment is still available when a judgment is
rendered by an inferior court in a case, and a <span style="">party thereto, by fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence, has
been unjustly deprived of a hearing therein, or has been prevented from taking
an appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9, paragraph 2 of
B.P. 129 placing the original exclusive jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals to
<u>annul</u> judgments of Regional Trial Courts has no relation to (sic) all to
the petition for relief provided for, in Rule 38 because these two are
completely different remedies.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The</u> <u>petitions</u> <u>for</u> <u>relief</u> <u>from</u> <u><span style="">judgment</span></u> <u>and</u> <u>interventions</u>
