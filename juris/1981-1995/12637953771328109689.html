				<H3>IN RE:Â  ATTY. SANTIAGO
F. MARCOS
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">By resolution dated February 20, 1970 in CA-G.R. No. 08475-CR,
People of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>, the Court of Appeals referred to this Court,
"for whatever disciplinary action it may deem proper to take against Atty.
Santiago Marcos", what it found to be said lawyer's unjustified delay in
filing brief for the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution was predicated on the following factual premises:</p>

<blockquote>"(O<span class="GramE">)n</span> <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1968</st1:date>, notice to file brief
was received by the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
appellant did not file his brief, a similar notice dated <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1969</st1:date>, was sent to Atty. Santiago F.
Marcos, his counsel in the court below, but the same was returned to this Court
with the notation 'unclaimed'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1969</st1:date>, this Court issued a
resolution requiring the appellant to show cause, within 10 days from notice,
why his appeal should not be dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1969</st1:date>,
the appellant filed a 'Manifestation' praying that his <span class="GramE">appeal</span>
be not dismissed and that he be granted an extension of 30 days within which to
file his brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The request was granted
in our resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="4">April 14, 1969</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime, Atty. Santiago F. Marcos filed an
'Appearance with Motion to Extend Time to File Brief' praying that he be
granted an extension of at least 25 days from notice within which to file the
appellant's brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In our resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1969</st1:date>, Atty. Marcos was
granted 'up to <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1969</st1:date>
within which to file appellant's brief'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A copy of said resolution was sent by ordinary mail to said counsel on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No appellant's brief having been filed with
the period granted, this Court, in its resolution of <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1969</st1:date>, again required the appellant
to show cause, within ten days from notice, why his appeal should not be
dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the 'Explanation, etc.' dated <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1969</st1:date>, the appellant's counsel claims
-</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-19.8pt">'2<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That</span> accused-appellant's failure to
file his brief <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> is due to the fact that he
was unaware of the resolution of this Honorable Court dated June 17, 1969,
granting his motion for extension of time to file his said brief, and it was
only upon his receipt of the resolution of this Court dated October 27, 1969,
that he came to know that his motion for extension was granted;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-19.8pt">'3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That, moreover, due to the trouble caused to
accused?appellant's undersigned counsel by the recent election, he being
a political leader, not to mention other legal works which pre?occupied
him, he failed to check from time to time the constant status of this case,
particularly his last motion filed for extension, lest he is sure that he (has)
not received by mail or personal delivery a copy of said resolution of this
Honorable Court dated June 17, 1969, granting him (accused-appellant) extension
of time to file brief;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x.'</span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">and</span>, accordingly,
prays that the appeal be not dismissed and that he be given an extension of 25
'days from today' within which to file the appellant's brief. <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In another motion of <st1:date year="1969" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1969</st1:date>, the appellant's counsel again
asked for an extension of 15 days from receipt of an order to that effect
'within which to submit the appellant's brief'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Up to this time, no appellant's brief has as yet been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 2-4, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having found the proffered explanation for the 15-month delay in
the filing of brief unsatisfactory, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal
of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> and,
as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, referred to this Court for
appropriate action its charge against <span class="SpellE">Sibayan's</span>
counsel of intentional delay in the termination of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required by this Court to answer the charge, Atty. Marcos stated
that he "did not bother filing any brief for the (accused-appellant) * *
because of the * * pleas and requests of accused-appellant himself and the
latter's relatives, particularly one Mr. Benito <span class="SpellE">Paas</span>,
the uncle of appellant D. <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> * * not to pursue
anymore said appeal for fear that the decision of the lower court might be
changed graver against <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> * *." He sought
to substantiate these averments at the investigation conducted by the Office of
the Solicitor General on this Court's instructions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds respondent's defenses to be untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly pointed out by the Solicitor
General:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent did not allege a similar defense in
his Explanation dated <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="11">November 26,
 1969</st1:date> to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet Benito <span class="SpellE">Paas</span> allegedly first requested
respondent in November, 1969 to desist from pursuing the appeal of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent gave only two reasons to the said
Court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that he was unaware of the
Court's Resolution dated <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1969</st1:date>
granting his motion for extension of time to file appellant's brief; and that
he was then engrossed in the elections as he was a political leader.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both explanations were considered
unsatisfactory by said Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>If there as such request for desistance in
pursuing the appeal in November and December, 1969, respondent could have then
filed the appropriate pleading to such effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His witness Benito <span class="SpellE">Paas</span> admitted that he has not seen any such pleading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such explanation could perforce be an
afterthought.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, respondent had been given
full opportunity to present additional evidence, but he apparently opted not to
adduce more."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An attorney is bound to protect his client's interest to the best
of his ability and with the utmost diligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Del Rosario vs. Court of Appeals, 114 SCRA 159) A failure to file brief
for his client certainly constitutes inexcusable negligence on his part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Villar</span>,
46 SCRA 107) The respondent has indeed committed a serious lapse in the duty
owed by him to his client as well as to the Court not to delay litigation and
to aid in the speedy administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Canons 21 and 22, Canons of Professional Ethics; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Daban</span>, 43 SCRA 185; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Estocada</span>,
43 SCRA 515)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> Atty. Santiago F. Marcos is severely
reprimanded and suspended from the practice of law for three (3) months
effective from date of his receipt hereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is further admonished to henceforth exercise greater care and
diligence in the performance of his duties towards his clients and the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and no motion for extension of time to file a
motion for reconsideration will be entertained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Let copies of this decision be attached to Atty. Marcos' personal record
and circulated among the different courts.</p>
