				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In this special civil action for mandamus and prohibition, which was 
filed with the Commission on Elections on September 29, 1980, and was 
certified to this Court on February 20, 1981, the petitioner (protestant
 in Election Case No. 308-C) seeks - (1) to compel respondent Judge 
Castor Z. Concepcion to allow him or his representatives to examine the 
registry lists of voters, voting records and all election documents used
 in 62 voting centers the examination of which was denied by said judge 
in his orders dated August 4, 1980 and September 3, 1980; (2) to 
prohibit said respondent judge from further proceeding with the trial of
 Election Case No. 308-C until after petitioner's experts shall have 
completed their examination, comparison, photography and matching of 
ballots; and (3) to preliminarily enjoin or temporarily restrain the 
respondent judge, pending resolution of this special civil action, from 
enforcing his order requiring petitioner-protestant to enter trial in 
said election case.
<p></p><p>
The petitioner, Arnulfo Abaya, and the private respondent, Eric Singson,
 were the candidates for mayor of the Municipality of Candon, Ilocos 
Sur, in the general election held on January 30, 1980.  On January 31, 
1980, the Municipal Board of Canvassers of Candon canvassed the election
 returns from the 68 voting centers of the town and proclaimed Eric 
Singson as the winning candidate for mayor.
</p><p>
Subsequently, Arnulfo Abaya filed with the Court of First Instance of 
Ilocos Sur, Branch VI, the "Petition of Protest" dated February 9, 1980,
 contesting all the election returns in the 68 voting centers of Candon 
on the grounds stated in par. 7 thereof, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "a)  Votes lawfully and validly cast in favor of protestant were 
either not read for him or read for protestee and counted in latter's 
favor; </p>
  <p> "b)  Votes lawfully and validly cast in favor of protestant after 
the ballots containing them were allowed to be marked and to annul them;
 </p>
  <p> "c)  Votes that were void because the ballots containing them were marked, were read and counted in favor of protestee; </p>
  <p> "d)  Votes reported in the election returns for protestee were 
unlawfully increased or padded such that he then appeared to have 
obtained more votes than those actually cast in his favor; </p>
  <p> "e)  Votes reported in some returns for protestant were unlawfully
 reduced such that he then appeared to have obtained less votes than 
those actually cast for him; </p>
  <p> "f)   Ballots prepared by one hand, ballots prepared by more than 
one hand, and ballots prepared by persons other than themselves and, 
therefore, invalid, were counted in favor of protestee."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Eric Singson filed his Answer dated February 16, 1980, denying the grounds invoked by Abaya in contesting the election returns.
</p><p>
After the issues were joined, Judge Castor Concepcion directed the 
production in court of all the ballot boxes, registry lists of voters, 
voting records and other election documents.  Likewise, said judge 
ordered that the ballot boxes be opened and that the ballots therein 
contained be examined and recounted by the duly appointed revisors 
and/or commissioners.
</p><p>
After the examination and recounting of the ballots in all the 68 voting
 centers, the protestant filed a motion to be allowed to examine the 
registry lists of voters, the voting records and all documents used in 
the election.  The protestee filed an opposition with motion to dismiss.
</p><p>
On August 4, 1980, Judge Concepcion issued the following Order:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Acting upon the motion to examine the Registry List of Voters and
 Voting Records filed by counsel for protestant, as well as the 
opposition thereto with Motion to Dismiss filed by counsel for 
protestee, the Court observes that except for the general allegations in
 the protest and the still unsubstantiated objections on the ballots 
marked by the Commissioners, no actual evidence of substitute voting was
 shown to the Court.  In order to obviate a 'fishing expedition method' 
of presenting evidence, the Court allows an examination only on the 
ballot boxes covering Precincts Nos. 29, 9, 9-A, 38, 35 and 35-A in 
which precincts protestant specified the existence of substitute voting 
(page 3, No. 1, petition) and providing further that the protestant 
shall specify in writing the nature and extent of the examination to be 
made subject to time constraints which may be fixed by the Court. </p>
  <p> "The motion to dismiss filed by counsel for protestee being 
inopportune as the protestant has not yet completed its evidence is 
hereby denied."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the examination of the registry lists of voters, voting records 
and documents used in the said six (6) voting centers, the protestant 
again filed a motion to be allowed to examine the registry lists of 
voters, voting records and documents used in the remaining 62 voting 
centers the examination of which was previously denied.  Again, the 
protestee opposed the motion.
</p><p>
On September 3, 1980, Judge Concepcion issued an order denying protestant's motion as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Acting upon the motion of counsel for protestant praying for a 
modification or amendment of the order of this Court dated August 4, 
1980, as well as the opposition thereto submitted by counsel for 
protestee, the Court finds that the ground relied upon by the protestant
 as contained in paragraph 3 of his motion does not equitably justify 
further examination of the remaining lists, coupons and other records.  
Considering that paragraph 7 (f) of the protest refers to ballots which 
should have been declared invalid but were counted in favor of the 
protestee, any discrepancy or incompatibility between any particular 
signature or thumbprint in the coupons, lists or records cannot in any 
manner whatsoever reveal or indicate which ballot such incompatibility 
or discrepancy refers to as to bring such ballot within the purview of 
this particular ground of the protest.  Considering further that during 
the revision of the ballots every opportunity was accorded to the 
protestant to determine which of the ballots can fall within this 
category in his protest, the Court finds no more cogent reason to 
warrant a modification and/or amendment of its order dated August 4, 
1980. </p>
  <p> "Wherefore, the motion is hereby DENIED. </p>
  <p> "Schedule hearing to September 18, 1980, at 8:30 a.m."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The protestant sought reconsideration of said order but the same was 
denied by Judge Concepcion in his order dated September 19, 1980.  In 
the same order, said judge set the hearing of the case to October 3, 
1980.
</p><p>
On September 29, 1980, the protestant filed with the Commission on 
Elections the petition for mandamus and prohibition with prayer for 
preliminary injunction and/or restraining order.  On October 2, 1980, 
said commission issued an order requiring the respondents to file an 
answer to the petition - in compliance with which the respondents filed 
with the commission on October 17, 1980, their answer to the petition.  
On January 23, 1981, the Commission on Elections issued an order 
dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction.  However, on February 
20, 1981, the commission reconsidered the order of dismissal and, 
instead, certified the petition to this Court.
</p><p>
On March 20, 1981, the petitioner filed with this Court a motion for the
 issuance of a restraining order and/or preliminary injunction.  He 
likewise filed on August 20, 1981, a supplemental petition seeking to 
disqualify the respondent judge from further hearing the election 
protest and to assign the same to another judge.
</p><p>
On October 15, 1981, this Court resolved to deny the supplemental 
petition to disqualify the respondent judge from further hearing the 
election protest on the ground that the same did not conform with the 
provisions of Secs. 1 and 2, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court.  However, 
on November 12, 1981, this Court resolved to issue a temporary 
restraining order.
</p><p>
The special remedies of mandamus and prohibition are not available in 
the instant case.  Firstly, it is not ministerial on the part of the 
respondent judge to allow the examination of the registry lists of 
voters, voting records and other election documents in the 62 voting 
centers as he is clothed with the discretion to allow or disallow such 
examination.  And secondly, the respondent judge did not abuse his 
discretion in disallowing such examination.
</p><p>
In support of his contention that it is a ministerial duty on the part 
of the respondent judge to allow the inspection of the registry lists of
 voters, voting records and other election documents in the 62 voting 
centers, the petitioner invokes Sec. 9, Rule VI of the Comelec 
Resolution No. 1451 (otherwise known as the Procedural Rules of Election
 Contests in the Courts of First Instance) which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 9.  Custody of ballot boxes, election documents and 
parapernalia. - Where allegations in a protest or counterprotest so 
warrant, or whenever in the opinion of the Court, the interest of 
justice so demands, it shall immediately order the book of voters, 
ballot boxes and their keys, ballots and other documents used in the 
election to be brought before it.  Said election documents and 
paraphernalia shall be kept and held secure in a place to be designated 
by the Court in the care and custody of the Clerk of Court."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But such provision does not impose upon the court the duty to allow the 
protestant to examine whatever election documents he may wish to 
examine.
</p><p>
Even assuming that the duty to allow inspection of election documents 
can be implied from the duty to require the production of the same in 
court, still, petitioner's contention (that the respondent judge is 
duty-bound to allow the examination of the registry lists of voters, 
voting records and other documents in the 62 voting centers) cannot be 
sustained.  For even the duty to require the production of the ballot 
boxes and the election records and documents under the provision invoked
 exists only when any of the following circumstances is present, namely:
  (1) when allegations in a protest or counterprotest so warrant; or (2)
 when the interest of justice so demands.  And the determination of the 
existence of said circumstances rests with the court itself.  
Ultimately, therefore, the court has the discretion to require or not to
 require the production of the ballot boxes and the election records and
 documents.  Similarly, the court has the discretion to allow or not to 
allow the examination of particular ballot boxes or election records and
 documents depending upon its finding as to whether the allegations of 
the protest or counterprotest warrant, or that the interest of justice 
demands, such examination.
</p><p>
Petitioner's contention that the respondent judge acted with grave abuse
 of discretion in disallowing the examination of the registry lists of 
voters and the election records and documents in the 62 voting centers 
cannot, likewise, be sustained.  For, as correctly observed by the 
respondent judge, the necessity for such examination has not been 
established and to allow the same may only give way to a "fishing 
expedition," not to mention the delay to be caused thereby.  While it is
 true that the protestant contests the election returns in all the 68 
voting centers of Candon, specific allegations of substitute voting - to
 which the documents sought to be examined are relevant - refer only to 
the 6 voting centers where the examination of the subject documents has 
already been allowed.  The respondent judge did not, therefore, err, 
much less abuse his discretion, in not allowing the examination of the 
registry lists of voters and other election records and documents in the
 remaining 62 voting centers.
</p><p>
<strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> the temporary restraining order issued by 
this Court on November 12, 1981, is lifted and the petition for mandamus
 and prohibition is dismissed for lack of merit.  Costs against the 
petitioner.
</p><p><strong>
SO ORDERED.
</strong>
</p><p>
<i>Fernando, C.J., Barredo, Concepcion, Jr., Fernandez, Guerrero, De Castro, Melencio-Herrera, Ericta, Plana,</i> and <i>Escolin, JJ., </i>concur.
