The accused, Gil Munar, appeals his conviction for the crime of Rape by 
the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch IX, on August 20, 
1971, which sentenced him to an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years 
and one (1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> as minimum to seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (l) day of <em>reclusion temporal </em>as
 maximum, to indemnify the offended party, a mentally retarded girl of 
19 years of age, in the sum of P5,000.00, and to pay the costs of suit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
<p>
In a Resolution, dated December 23, 1974, the Court of Appeals (now 
Intermediate Appellate Court) where the ap­peal was initially brought, 
certified the case to this Tribunal on the ground that since the lowest 
penalty prescribed for rape is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, the same is within our exclu­sive appellate jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  However, on January 30, 1984, in conformity with our ruling in People vs. Daniel,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  we returned the records of the case to the Intermediate Appellate 
Court for the determination of the proper penalty as the circumstances 
warrant, with a comprehensive written analysis of the evidence and 
discussion of the law involved, but the Intermediate Appellate Court 
shall refrain from en­tering judgment, and shall thereafter certify the 
case and elevate the entire records thereof to this Court for review.
</p><p>
Conformably to that directive, on March 21, 1984, the Appellate Court, 
in a Decision penned by Justice Lorna S. Lombos-de la Fuente and 
concurred in by Justices Emilio A. Gancayco and Isidro C. Borromeo, 
found that the appealed judgment should be modified such that the 
imposable penalty shall be <em>reclusion perpetua</em> inasmuch as the 
rape was committed with the use of a deadly weapon, and its commission 
was not attended by any modifying circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The case is with us now for review, without any judgment having been entered in the Appellate Court.
</p><p>
Upon a careful review of the evidence, we sustain the factual findings 
and conclusions of law embodied in the Ap­pellate Court's judgment, and,
 therefore, adopt the same and append it as an integral part of this 
Decision (Annex "A").
</p><p>
The fact that complainant was feeble-minded, whose actual age at the 
time of the incident was 19 years but whose mental age was that of a 
5-year-old child, does not affect her credibility.  As stated by the 
Trial Court, her answers were intelligible enough to be understood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  She could convey her thoughts by words and signs.  And as the 
examining physician of the National Mental Hospital testified, the 
mental deficiency does not prevent her from recalling painful 
experiences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  She is a competent witness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  There may have been inconsistencies in her testimony, but the same are
 minor and do not detract from the vital fact that she had, in fact, 
been abused by the accused in the manner that she had narrated.  Neither
 the Trial Court nor the Appellate Court, therefore, erred in giving 
weight and credence to her testimony, there being no improper motive 
shown.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
The denials by the accused, specifically, that the complainant did not 
go to his store on the day the incident allegedly took place, and that 
he never had sexual intercourse with the complainant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  do not deserve credence in the face of the positive and unwavering 
identification of the accused by the complainant.  She testified that on
 March 2, 1967 when she went to buy starch from the accused in his 
store, the latter asked her to go inside and then with a knife in hand, 
forced her to lie down, then raised her dress, threw her panty away and 
had sexual intercourse with her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  That the carnal assault did take place is corroborated by the genital 
examination made by the Municipal Health Officer on the complainant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
The accused's testimony that the motive of the complainant's family in 
filing the trumped-up case against him was that the mother owes him 
P133.00 while the brother owes him P250.00 for goods taken on credit, 
for which he demanded payment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>  was belied by complainant's mother, who declared that they do not owe money to the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>
  In fact, the accused himself testified that he stopped ex­tending 
credit to complainant's family since 1964 and did not collect the debt 
anymore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</p><p>
Considering that the rape was committed with the use of a knife, a 
deadly weapon, and in the absence of any modi­fying circumstances 
attending its commission, the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> conforms to Article 335 in relation to Article 63(2) of the Revised Penal Code.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, we affirm the judgment of conviction imposed upon the accused, Gil Munar, and sentence him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>,
 with the modification that the indemnification to the offended party is
 hereby increased to P15,000.00.  Costs against the accused-appellant.
SO ORDERED.
