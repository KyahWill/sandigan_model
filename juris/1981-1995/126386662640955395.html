<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1987</st1:date>,
upon arraignment, accused-appellant assisted by counsel de officio entered <span style="">a </span>plea of not guilty to the offense

ensued thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing Patrolman Pedro <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>,
the principal witness for the prosecution, testified that he is <span style="">a </span><span style="">member
of the Special Operations Group </span>of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City Police; <span style="">that on September 11,
1987, at about 12:30 in the afternoon, he proceeded to Leonardo and D</span>e <span style="">Las Alas Streets, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, to conduct a surveillance per instruction </span>of Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span>, as <span style="">the

Ricardo Reyes, Patrolman Norman Reyes and Patrolman Marcos <span class="SpellE">Butay</span>
acted as his back-up; that at the corner of De Las A<span style="">las and Leonardo </span><span style="">Streets,
<span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, he </span><span style="">saw </span><span style="">three m</span>e<span style="">n being
approached by another man who handed a rolled paper to the group </span>of men
in exchange of money; that he approached the <span style="">group and posed as a buyer; that he gave a twenty-peso bill to one of
the men</span> in <span style="">the group who turned </span>it
<span style="">over </span>to the accused-appellant;
that <span style="">the accused-appellant left the

returned and handed to him (<span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>) two </span>foils

he </span>was <span style="">investigat</span>e<span style="">d; that the two </span>foils of suspected
marijuana <span style="">were </span><span style="">brought to the NBI for laboratory
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the trial he positively
identified accused Romeo de la </span>Cruz <span style="">as the person </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">handed to him the
two foils of marijuana leaves (Hearing of February 12, 1988; TSN, pp. 39-46).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Neva <span class="SpellE">Gamosa</span>, Forensic Chemist of

on the buy-bust operation directed against the group of alias “<span class="SpellE">Itik</span>” using the latter as the poseur-buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also confirmed the arrest of
accused-appellant during the b<span style="">uy-bust

cigarette foils to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">NBI for laboratory examination (Hearing of
December 9 and 22, 1987; TSN, pp. 10-46).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused-appellant denied that he sold
marijuana to <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1987</st1:date>, he was outside
their house located at No. 25, <st1:address><st1:street>Leonardo Street</st1:street>,

<p class="BODY">Orlando Miranda, a witness for the defense, testified that the

<p class="BODY">The appellant faults the trial court for finding that there was
an entrapment instead of finding that there was <span class="GramE">an
instigation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The idea to commit
the crime allegedly came not from him but from <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>,
the poseur-buyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is a wide difference between entrapment and instigation,
for while in the latter case the instigator practically induces the would-be
accused into the commission of the offense and himself becomes co-principal, in
entrapment ways and means are resorted to for the purpose of trapping and
capturing the lawbreaker in the execution of the criminal plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Galicia, C.A. No. 8156, Sept. 29,
1941, 40 O.G. 4476; <span style="">see </span>also People
v. <span class="SpellE">Gatong</span>-o, No. 78698, December 29, 1988).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was <span style="">no showing </span>on the part of appellant that the police officers
induced him to sell marijuana leaves and that he would not <span class="GramE">had</span>
sold the same without their inducement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> simply approached the group of three (3) men
standing in the corner of Leonardo and De <span class="SpellE">las</span> Alas
Streets, offered to buy marijuana from them and handed a twenty peso bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant accepted the money, immediately
left and upon his return he handed two (2) foils of the “stuff” to <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We noted
the ease with which the police officers were able to purchase the marijuana
leaves from the accused-appellant which shows that it was customary for him to
sell the “stuff” on demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding
belies any claim by appellant that there was instigation instead of an
entrapment:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the
general rule is that it is no defense to the perpetrator of a crime that
facilities for its commission were purposely placed in his way, or that the
criminal act was done at the ‘decoy solicitation’ of persons seeking to expose
the criminal, or that detectives feigning complicity in the act were present
and apparently assisting in its commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Especially is this true in that <span style="">class of cases </span>where the offense is one of a
kind habitually committed, and the solicitation merely furnishes evidence of a
course of conduct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere deception by the
detective will not shield defendant, if the offense was committed by him free
from the influence or the instigation of the detective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(16 Corpus <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Juris</span></span><span style="">, </span>page 88,
section 57; cited in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> Se <span class="SpellE">Tieng</span>,
56 Phil. 52-54)” U.S. v. Phelps, 16 Phil. 440)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that based on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>, the team who planned to conduct the buy-bust
operation proceeded to the area to entrap a certain “<span class="SpellE">Itik</span>,”
based on the report received from some residents of <span class="SpellE">Tramo</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, <span style="">about </span>the prevalence of drug-peddling in the locality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Before
</span>the apprehension of the appellant, the police <span style="">officers </span>had no real evidence that the appellant <span style="">was </span>a marijuana seller.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span>, the leader of the team which
conducted the operation instructed his men to proceed to the area not solely to
capture “<span class="SpellE">Itik</span>,” the known supplier of marijuana in
the area, but to conduct <span style="">a </span>surveillance of the area and if possible to buy from “<span class="SpellE">Itik’”s</span> group (p. 5, TSN, Testimony of <span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span>,
Dec. <span style="">9, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the appellant was not known to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
authorities as a marijuana peddler before the latter conducted the buy-bust
operation is not fatal to </span>the cause of the prosecution in view of the
positive testimony of <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> that he bought the
marijuana leaves from accused-appellant and the latter was arrested while
delivering the marijuana leaves to <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further contends that there was no sale of marijuana
because the prosecution failed to present in evidence the money used in the
buy-bust operation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>failure of the
prosecution to present the twenty-peso bill used in the buy-bust operation does
not negate the existence of the crime charged against the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Gatong</span>-o,
No. 78698, December 29, 1988, it was held that even without the money to buy
the marijuana, when the police officer went through the motion as a buyer and
his offer was accepted by the appellants and the marijuana delivered to the
police officer, the crime was <span style="">consummated
</span>by the delivery of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, in People v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, G.R. No. 81332,
April 25, 1989, “(T)he fact that the <span style="">accused
returned with the amount of marijuana </span>corresponding to the offered price
suffices to constitute if not sale, then delivery or giving away <span style="">to another and distribution of the prohibited
drug punishable under Section 4, Article 11 of Republic Act </span>6425.” It
was not clearly established where the twenty-peso bill went but it does not
weaken the cause <span style="">of the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So long as the marijuana
actually given by the accused was presented </span><span style="">before the lower court, the absence </span>of marked money does not
create a hiatus in the prosecution evidence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>,
G.R. No. 81332, April 25, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his third assignment of errors, petitioner argues that the
uncorroborated testimony of the poseur-buyer (<span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>)
and that of the other police officers are beset with several inconsistencies
and contradictions, particularly on the money used in the alleged buy-bust
operation and the identification of the wrapper used to wrap the foils
containing marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span> testified that he supplied the money used in the
“buy-bust” operation but when he was asked what the denomination/s of the money
was/were, he answered that he could not remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> however,
testified that it was a twenty-peso bill.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may be that <span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span>, the head of
the “buy-bust” team, was least interested in taking note of the denomination of
the money used in the entrapment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
when he was asked on the witness stand, he testified that he could not remember
the denomination of the “buy-bust” money he gave to <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> however,
did not contradict <span class="SpellE">Lammatao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> positively
identified the money as a twenty-peso bill. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> was in a
better position to testify that it was a twenty-peso bill because he was the
actual poseur-buyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> was asked on <span style="">the
k</span>ind of <span style="">paper used in wrapping
the marijuana leaves, he testified on direct examination that the accused-appellant
handed him two (2) foils of suspected </span>marijuana leaves wrapped in
cigarette wrapper and further wrapped in a cigarette foil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(T<span style="">SN,
Pat. </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Serafico</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">,

the two (2) foils of marijuana leaves sold <span style="">to </span>him were wrapped in cigarette foils.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reyes, on the other hand, testified that
there were three (3) foils of marijuana leaves taken from the accused, two (2)
foils wrapped in cigarette foils and one (1) foil wrapped in a piece of comics
page.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, Pat. <span class="GramE">Norman
Reyes, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="12"><span class="GramE">December
 22, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, p. 6).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reconciling the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> and Norman Reyes, what was actually taken from the
accused-appellant were three (3) foils of marijuana leaves two (2) foils
wrapped in cigarette foils were taken from him by <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>
at the time of the actual “buy-bust” and the third foil, wrapped in a comics
paper was not taken from the accused-appellant by <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span>
at the time the “buy-bust” actually took place but after the other members of
the team closed-in on the appellant, arrested him and frisked him for any
possible concealed weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as <span style="">it </span>may, the matter of what wrapper was
used on the marijuana leaves or what was the denomination/s of the “buy-bust”
money are collateral matters and do not touch upon the commission of the crime
itself which was <span class="SpellE">consumated</span> when accused-appellant
gave the marijuana leaves, a prohibited drug, to the poseur-buyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the appellant, the investigation conducted by the
police investigators while the accused was in their custody failed to comply
with the requirement mandated by the <span style="">Constitution
</span>that a person under investigation must be represented by a lawyer of his
choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt signed by the
appellant, while he was under investigation, showing that the marijuana leaves
seized belongs to him should not have been admitted in evidence by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the appellant in this case was caught in <span class="SpellE"><u>flagrante</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marijuana presented in evidence was taken
from him during the buy-bust operation and not when the appellant was under
investigation after he was accosted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">was </span>evidence
obtained pursuant to a lawful arrest and therefore, admissible in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even without presenting the receipt he <span style="">was </span>allegedly
made to sign while he was under investigation, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Serafico</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> the poseur-buyer
positively identified him <span style="">as </span>the seller of the <span style="">marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two foils of marijuana bought from him
and the rolled marijuana taken from his person when brought to the NBI
laboratory was tested positive for marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt on the basis of the
testimonies and evidence independent of any extra-judicial confession or other </span>evidence
gathered during the investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also submits <span style="">that
</span>the testimony of its witness, Orlando Miranda is convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His demeanor in the witness stand has all the
marks of honesty, clarity and straightforwardness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Even
on </span>cross-examination, he testified that the man from whom<span style=""> the</span><span style=""> police officers bought the marijuana leaves was a </span>certain <span class="SpellE">Berto</span> and not the herein appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be believed as the trial court did not believe that <span class="SpellE">Serafico</span> bought marijuana leaves during the buy-bust
operations from a person named <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Berto</span></span><span style=""> and not
from the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were</span> <span style="">true that, as claimed by Orlando Miranda, a
witness for the prosecution, that the actual seller was <span class="SpellE">Berto</span>
and not the accused, the police officers should have arrested <span class="SpellE">Berto</span> </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">not the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the authorities should not have allowed</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Berto</span></span><span style=""> to leave after selling them the “stuff” </span>as <span style="">they were conducting a buy-bust operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have held that the </span>matter
of assigning value <span style="">to </span>declarations
<span style="">at </span>the witness stand is best and
most competently performed by the trial judge, who unlike appellate
magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the light of the <span class="SpellE">declarant’s</span>
demeanor, conduct and attitude at th<span style="">e </span>trial
and thereby placed in a more competent position to discriminate <span style="">between the true</span> and the false<span style=""> </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Baluyut</span>,
G.R. No. 82998, February 23, 1989).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Generally, the findings of<span style=""> </span>fact
by the trial court are <span style="">entitled </span>to
great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent
reasons because <span style="">the </span><span style="">trial </span><span style="">court </span>is in a better position to examine real evidence, as well
as to observe the demeanor of<span style=""> the </span>witnesses
while testifying (P<span style="">e</span>ople v.

unless<span style=""> </span>the trial court has
plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value which if considered,
might affect the result of the case (People v. Martinez, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-39402, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="9"><span class="GramE">September <span style="">24, </span>1986</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 144 SCRA 303).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have reviewed the records of this case and <span class="GramE">We</span>
find no reason to depart from the findings of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution witnesses have no reason to <span style="">impute the crime upon the appellant if it
were not true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The </span><span style="">prosecution witnesses being law enforcers are presumed to have

improper motive other than to accomplish their mission (People v. <span class="SpellE">Capulong</span>, G.R. No. 65674, April 15, 1988, 160 SCRA
