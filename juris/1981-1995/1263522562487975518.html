In January, 1981, Nicario Avisado bought a Colt Lancer from Wheels 
Distributors, Inc. payable on monthly installments. The obligation was 
evidenced by a promissory note secured by a chattel mortgage on the car.
 The promissory note carries a stipulation on acceleration of maturity 
for the entire obligation in the event of default in the payment of any 
installment. Later, the obligation together with the supporting security
 was transferred by Wheels Distri­butors, Inc. to Filinvest Credit 
Corporation (Filinvest) with the consent of Avisado.
<p>
For failure of Avisado to pay the installments due on May 1 through 
October 1, 1981, Filinvest filed on October 12, 1981 against him a 
replevin/collection suit (Civil Case No. F-21040). But this case was 
dismissed with prejudice at the instance of Filinvest after the 
defendant had agreed to update his installment payments.
</p><p>
Later, however, Avisado again defaulted in the payment of subsequent 
installments, this time, those due on December 1, 1981 and the four 
succeeding months, which impelled Filinvest to file another 
replevin/collection suit against Avisado (Civil Case No. R-21996). After
 commencement of the action, a writ of replevin was issued against a 
bond duly posted, by virtue of which the car was seized by the sheriff 
and turned over to Filinvest. Once in possession of the car, Filinvest 
extra-judicially foreclosed the chattel mortgage thereon. At the 
foreclosure sale, the car was sold to Filinvest for an amount equal to 
its claim against the mortgagor. Later, Filinvest re-sold the car to 
Warsito Capangpangan.
</p><p>
However, upon motion of Avisado, the trial court issued an Order dated 
September 21, 1982 dismissing the complaint on the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res 
judicata</span>. Said the court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Admittedly, in Case No. 21040, demanded was payment of P81,819.25
 with interest from October 3, 1981, until full payment in case manual 
delivery of the motor vehicle cannot be effected. Supposedly, this 
amount repre­sented the entire unpaid balance after alleged default in 
the payment of the installment which fell due on May 1, 1981, and the 
succeeding five (5) installments ending October 1, 1981. If at all there
 was a demand for full payment of the balance, it was pre­cisely because
 of the stipulation in the pro­missory note and the chattel mortgage 
that in case of failure to pay any of the monthly installments, the 
entire balance shall automatically become due and payable or a system 
typical of an acceleration clause. This is equally true with respect to 
the demand in the present case for payment of the entire balance of 
P64,313.28 with interest computation supposedly at 24% per annum from 
March 20, 1982, until full payment in case of failure to do manual 
delivery of the motor vehicle pursuant to an identical accelaration 
clause as provided for in par. 8 of the complaint. No doubt, the motor 
vehicles, subject matter of the present case and Case No. 21040, are one
 and the same. </p>
  <p> "It is obvious, the prior dismissal was by virtue of Rule 17, Sec.
 1 of the Rules of Court. This Court would like to recall, the formal 
notice of dismissal with prejudice was at the instance of the plaintiff.
 Likewise, the Order of Dismissal was one with prejudice. </p>
  <p> "It is a matter of jurisprudence that at anytime before service of
 the answer, the plaintiff may dismiss its action even without order of 
the Court by the mere filing of a Notice of Dismissal. The dismissal is 
supposedly without prejudice but the plaintiff in his motion may make 
the dismissal without day which is equivalent to a waiver of his cause 
of action (<em>Estate of Yangco vs. De Asis, 22 Phil. 201</em>) or a 'retraxit'. (<em>9 RCL 191-192</em>).
 The effect of a dismissal without day is an adjudication upon the 
merits of the case. The implication necessarily is a waiver of the cause
 of action irrespective of whether or not a default in payment of the 
monthly installments in Case No. 21040 was for a period entirely 
different from the period or term being mentioned in the present case. 
Otherwise stated, differences in installment terms as basis of the 
action in the prior and the present case is immaterial. This Court 
cannot accept the pretention that the present case should be given due 
course notwithstanding prior dismissal with prejudice only because the 
contract stipulated a schedule of payment by way of installments or a 
stipulation which supposedly provided performance of several 
obligations. What the Court cannot take lightly is the observation that 
in Case No. 21040 the alternative option, in case of failure to return 
the motor vehicle, was the payment of the entire obligation with 
interest computation but less prior amortizations. Also in the present 
case, identical prayer was for payment of the entire unpaid balance with
 interests but less prior installment payments in case of failure to 
return the unit. </p>
  <p> "A dismissal necessarily should be given due course. To be 
precise, Rule 17, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court does not establish any 
qualification. A dismissal with prejudice would amount to an absolute 
waiver of the cause of action." (Petition, Annex "E.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Twenty days after receipt (September 28, 1982) of the order of 
dismissal, Filinvest filed (October 18, 1982) a motion for 
reconsideration on the ground that the dismissal with prejudice of the 
first case did not bar the filing of the second because they had 
different causes of action; while Avisado filed an ex-parte motion for 
the return of the re-possessed vehicle on the ground that the (second) 
replevin/collection case, having been ordered dismissed, "it necessarily
 follows that the car which is the subject matter (thereof)... should be
 returned to defendant." (Petition, Annex "G".)
</p><p>
On January 3, 1983, the court issued an order denying the motion for 
reconsideration and at the same time directing the return to Avisado of 
the vehicle without waiting for the order of dismissal (on which the 
return order was based) to become final. A copy of the said order was <em>served </em>on Filinvest on February 1, 1983.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, i.e., on January 5, 1983, Avisado filed an ex-parte motion 
praying that a writ of execution be issued directing Filinvest or any 
person in possession of the motor vehicle in question to de­liver the 
same to Avisado. On January 11, 1983, the court ordered the counsel of 
Filinvest to comment on the said motion within 20 days "from today".
</p><p>
On February 7, 1983 (six days following notice to Filinvest of denial of
 its motion for reconsidera­tion), after noting that no opposition to 
the motion for execution had been filed, the Court ordered the issuance 
of a writ of execution, without waiting for the order dismissing the 
case to become final. Note that the notice of denial of the motion for 
reconsi­deration was received by Filinvest only on February 1, 1983; and
 from the date Filinvest received a copy of the order dismissing the 
case up to the date it filed the motion for reconsideration, there was a
 spread of only 20 days.
</p><p>
It appears that petitioner was never served with a copy either of 
Avisado's ex-parte motion for execution or the court's order of January 
11, 1983 directing it to comment thereon.
</p><p>
Accordingly, a writ of execution was issued on February 9, 1983; and the
 vehicle was on the same date seized from Warsito Capangpangan and 
delivered to Avisado.
</p><p>
Filinvest has therefore filed the instant petition assailing the dismissal by the court <em>a quo</em>
 of C.C. R-21996 on the ground of <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>, the precipitate return 
of the car in question to Avisado and the premature grant of a writ of 
execution before finality of the order dismissing the case.
</p><p>
Required to comment on the petition, private respondent Warsito 
Capangpangan did so. On the other hand, private respondent Avisado asked
 for an extension of ten days from April 4, 1983 within which to file 
his comment, which was granted; but his comment never came.
</p><p>
Private respondent Avisado having failed to controvert the allegations 
of the petition which appears to be fully supported by the documents 
annexed thereto, the Court resolved to give due course to the petition 
and deem it submitted for decision.
</p><p>
We hold that the court <em>a quo</em> erred in dismissing C.C. R-21996. 
Since the first case instituted by Filinvest against Avisado (C.C. 
R-21040) was for nonpayment of installments different from those on 
which the second suit (C.C. R-21996) was based, the dismissal of the 
former with prejudice would not bar the filing of the latter, nor serve 
as basis for its dismissal. The causes of action being different, there 
could be no <span style="font-style: italic;">res judicata</span>.
</p><p>
For having thus dismissed C.C. R-21996, and for having granted the writ 
of execution with undue haste before finality of the order dismissing 
the case and in prematurely ordering the return to the mortgagor of the 
re-possessed vehicle, the court <em>a quo</em> committed grave abuse of discretion.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the assailed order of dismissal dated September 21, 1982 of the court <em>a quo</em>,
 its order dated January 3, 1983 directing the return of the vehicle in 
question to the mortgagor, and the order dated February 7, 1983 for the 
issuance of a writ of execution and the writ of execution issued in 
pursuance thereof, are set aside. Accordingly, the disputed vehicle 
shall be restored to the possession of Warsito Capangpangan, without 
prejudice to the outcome of C.C. R-21996. Costs against private 
respondent Nicario Avisado.
SO ORDERED.
