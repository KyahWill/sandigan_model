in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">C-2407.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 October 1969, petitioner, National Onion Grower Cooperative
Marketing Association, Inc. (NOGROCOMA) obtained a loan of P300,000.00 from
private respondent, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay</span>, payable within<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> one (</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">1</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">) year, </span>with interest
at twelve (12%) per annum, payable in advance.</p>

<p class="BODY">As security for the loan, petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">executed</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> in </span><span class="SpellE">Goquiolayâ€™s</span> favor a real estate mortgage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on its </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">two (2) </span>parcels of land located in <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Malabon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, </span>together with the improvements thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage was registered with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Regi</span>ster of Deeds on <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="10">3 October 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="2" month="12">2 December 1970</st1:date>,
the loan having been unpaid on maturity date, <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay</span>
demanded payment in writing from Petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">latter </span>failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay, <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay</span> </span>proceeded
to foreclose the mortgage <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="24" month="2">24 February 1971</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">filed suit
before </span>the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, seeking to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) declare the mortgage contract void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for being
usurious; (b) recover from <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay</span> the usurious
interest on the loan; and (c) obtain a Writ of Preliminary Injunction to enjoin
foreclosure and sale at public auction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court had earlier granted the prayer for Preliminary
Injunction but since, in <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay's</span> Answer, he had
abandoned the extrajudicial foreclosure and had, instead, claimed for judicial
foreclosure, the restraint was rendered moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial issue is whether or not Petitioner had, in fact,
received the total consideration of P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>stipulated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span>the loan document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
maintains that of the said amount it had received only the sum of P195<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> inasmuch as P105,000.00 thereof was withheld as
advance payment of interest, or actually 35% of the loan, which is clearly
usurious for being beyond the maximum allowed by the Usury Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">On </span>the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay</span> asserts that Petitioner received the entire
proceeds of the loan of P300,000.00 except for the amount of P36,000.00, which
was applied to the payment of interest at twelve (12%) percent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the Trial Court and the Court of Appeals found, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>established fact, that the
different amounts released to Petitioner (Exhibits "3",
"4", "5", "6" and "7") aggregated
P300,000.00, or the full amount of the loan proceeds.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Trial </span>Court
had observed, in Petitioner's reply to <span class="SpellE">Goquiolay's</span>
letter of demand, dated 4 December 1970, "it had promised to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">pay </span>within
15 days the amount of P300,000.00 with the corresponding interest"
(Exhibit "11"), no mention whatsoever having been made of any
usurious charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the disposition
of the case by the Trial Court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the instant action is hereby dismissed and the
plaintiff, the National Onion Growers Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc.
is hereby ordered to pay the defendant Vicente F. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Goquiolay</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, the sum of P300,000.00 with 12% interest
per annum from October 2, 1970, within a period of ninety (90) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">days </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">from receipt hereof, and in default of such payment the mortgaged
properties shall be sold at public auction in accordance with the law and
proceeds thereof applied to the satisfaction of this </span>judgment.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no pronouncement as to the payment of other
interests, as well as damages" (p. 52, Record on Appeal).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals also found "no clear, positive and
convincing evidence to prove appellant's (petitioner's) allegations of
usury," and fully affirmed the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon examination of the evidence, we agree with the express
conclusions arrived at, apart from the consideration that the findings of fact
made by lower Courts are generally entitled to great respect if not conclusive
on this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We need only invoke what
has been reiterated in a long line of decisions, the exceptions to which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">do not </span>obtain in this case.</p>

<blockquote>"This court cannot set aside the express finding of the Court
of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Time and again we have ruled
that it is not the function of the Supreme Court to analyze or weigh such
evidence all over again, its jurisdiction being limited to reviewing errors of
law that might have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">committed by
the lower Court" (<span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span> v. de la Merced,
L-24426, July 25, 1974, 58 SCRA 89; Corona </span>v. CA, L-62482, April 28,
1983, 121 SCRA 865; <span class="SpellE">Baniqued</span> vs. CA, L-47531,
February 20, 1984, 127 SCRA 596).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It has been well-settled that the jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court in cases brought to it from the Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing
and revising the errors of law imputed to it, its findings of fact being
conclusive" (Chan vs. CA, L-27488, June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 737; <span class="SpellE">Knecht</span> v. CA, L-65114, F<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">e</span>bruary 23, 1988, 158 SCRA 80).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The full amount of the loan of P300,000.00 having been proven to
have been received by Petitioner, the Usury Law finds no application in this
case besides the fact that it is no longer in force.</p>

<blockquote>"For sometime now, usury has been legally non-existent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Interest can now be charged as lender and
borrower may agree upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The rules of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Court in
regard to allegations of usury, procedural in nature, should be considered
repealed with retroactive effect" (Liam Law v. Olympic Sawmill Co.,
L-30771, May 28, 1984, 129 SCRA 439).</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition is DENIED and the judgment of
respondent Court of Appeals sought to be reviewed is hereby AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cost against petitioner.</p>
