				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review on <u>certiorari</u>, instituted by the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
assails the decision, dated <st1:date year="1992" day="24" month="2">24
 February 1992</st1:date>, of respondent appellate court, affirming that of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, which orders the reconstitution of a Transfer
Certificate of Title ("TCT") in favor of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="8">21 August 1989</st1:date>,
private respondent Norma Vargas <span class="SpellE">Conjares</span>, through her
attorney-in-fact Ester <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, filed a petition with
the Regional Trial Court ("RTC"), Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 17,
of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
for reconstitution of the original and owner's duplicate of TCT No. T-6583 of
the Register of Deeds for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The late Benita <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> and Juan Vargas
were the alleged registered owners of a parcel of land (<st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
1139-B of the subdivision plan Psd-37865), situated in <span class="SpellE">Tanza</span>.
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
with an area of twenty five thousand four hundred sixty five (25,465) square
meters, covered by TCT No. T-6583 of the Registry of Deeds for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.
Private Respondent Norma Vargas <span class="SpellE">Conjares</span> acquired, on
<st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="11">02 November 1982</st1:date>, the
property by virtue of a Deed of Extrajudicial Partition executed among the
heirs of Benita <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>. The owner's duplicate copy
of TCT No. T-6583 was said to have been lost in the course of the transfer of <span class="SpellE">Conjares</span> and her family from their former residence to their
new address at <span class="SpellE">Tandang</span> <span class="SpellE">Sora</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.
All efforts to find the TCT proved to be futile. <span class="SpellE">Tamayo's</span>
inquiries with the Office of the Register of Deeds regarding the status of the
original file copy of TCT No. T-6583 likewise produced negative results. Presumably,
the title was among the records destroyed when the <st1:place><st1:placename>Old</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which then housed the
Office of the Register of Deeds, was razed by fire on <st1:date year="1959" day="7" month="6">07 June 1959</st1:date>. Private respondent submitted, among
other papers, a copy of the subdivision plan Psd-37865, with the corresponding
technical description of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1139-B, shown to have been
approved by the Director of Lands on <st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="6">04
 June 1953</st1:date>. The subject parcel appeared to have been declared for
taxation purposes in the name of Benita <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the RTC granted the petition. It accordingly
adjudged, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the petition to be well-taken, the Court
hereby grants the same and orders the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
Province, after petitioner's payment of the prescribed legal fees, to
reconstitute the original of TCT No. T-6583 in the name of Benita <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> on the basis of plan Psd-37865 and the
corresponding technical description of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1139-B (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F and I) duly approved by the Land Registration
Authority; and to issue in favor of the petitioner a corresponding new owner's
duplicate copy of TCT No. T-6583, hereby declaring as null and void the missing
original file copy and the old owner's duplicate copy lost by the petitioner.
The reconstituted original and duplicate copies shall be given like faith and
credit as the ones lost and shall be regarded as such for all legal intents and
purposes.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, representing the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
herein petitioner, appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals mainly on the
thesis that since the required publication for the initial hearing on the
petition had not been met, the RTC could not be said to have acquired
jurisdiction over the case. Petitioner observed that private respondent merely
submitted to the court a certificate of publication issued by the National
Printing Press. The two issues (<st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="10">30
 October 1989</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="11">06
 November 1989</st1:date>) of the Official Gazette, however, where the notices
supposedly appeared, were not presented in Court. In any case, petitioner
averred, the certificate of publication indicated that the <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="11">06 November 1989</st1:date> issue of the Official Gazette
was released for circulation only on <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="11">14
 November 1989</st1:date>, or merely twenty-one (21) days prior to the initial
hearing on <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="12">06 December 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1992" day="24" month="2">24 February 1992</st1:date>,
respondent appellate court decided thusly:</p>

<blockquote>"The Certificate of Publication issued by the Director of the
National Printing Press Office, stated that the order of the court <i style="">a quo</i>, dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1989</st1:date>, was published in Volume 85 Nos.
44 and 45, October 30, and <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="11">November 6,
 1989</st1:date> issues of the Official Gazette.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1989</st1:date>
issue was released for circulation on <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1989</st1:date>, and although the second issue was released for
circulation on <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1989</st1:date>,
22 days prior to the scheduled date of initial hearing on <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1989</st1:date>, short of the 30 day requirement
of publication, there is substantial compliance with the law. The first issue
dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1989</st1:date> was
released for publication 30 days prior to the initial hearing.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be noted that the purpose of the publication of the
notice of the petition for reconstitution in the Official Gazette, is to
apprise the whole world that such petition has been filed. The publication of
the second notice of initial hearing 22 days prior to the date of the scheduled
hearing is sufficient compliance, in order to notify the parties interested
thereto, that such petition for reconstitution of title has been filed.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the Republic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 13, Republic Act No. 26<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13. The court shall cause a notice of the petition,
filed under the preceding section, to be published, at the expense of the
petitioner, twice in successive issues of the Official Gazette, and to be
posted on the main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal
building of the municipality or city in which he land is situated, at least
thirty days prior to the date of hearing. The court shall likewise cause a copy
of the notice to be sent, by registered mail or otherwise, at the expense of
the petitioner, to every person named therein whose address is known, at least
thirty days prior to the date of hearing. Said notice shall state, among other
things, the number of the lost or destroyed certificate of title, if known, the
name of the registered owner, the names of the occupants or persons in
possession of the property, the owners of the adjoining properties and all
other interested parties, the location, area and boundaries of the property,
and the date on which all persons having any interest therein must appear and
file their claim or objections to the petition. The petitioner shall, at the
hearing, submit proof of the publication, posting and service of the notice as
directed by the court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a number of cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court has already laid down the rule that the requirements of Republic Act
No. 26 are indispensable and must be strictly complied with. In Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> vs. Regional Trial Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that the publication of the notice of hearing in the Official Gazette
at least thirty (30) days prior to the initial hearing of a petition for
reconstitution is essential to confer jurisdiction upon the court. The rule was
reiterated in the recent case of Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Court of Appeals and the Philippine National Bank,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, in denying a similar petition for reconstitution of title,
said:</p>

<blockquote>"The jurisdictional requirement of publication of a petition
for reconstitution of title, refers to the actual publication of the notice of
initial hearing of the petition in two successive issues of the Official
Gazette (with the required posting and notice by registered mail or otherwise
to specified persons) and its <i style="">release for
circulation at least thirty (30) days before the scheduled hearing</i> (Zuniga
vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span>, 153 SCRA 720). The purpose of such
publication is to apprise the whole world that such a petition has been filed
and that whoever is minded to oppose it for good cause may do so within thirty
(30) days before the date set by the court for hearing the petition. It is the
publication of such notice that brings in the whole world as a party in the
case and vests the court with jurisdiction to hear and decide it (Register of
Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> vs. RTC of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
M.M., Branch 170, 181 SCRA 788).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Certificate of Publication revealed that the August 28,
1989 Supplement issue of the Official Gazette was released for circulation on
October 13, 1989, which was only seventeen (17) days before the scheduled
hearing set by the court on October 30, 1989. Clearly, the jurisdictional
requirement of publication in accordance with law had not been met for the law
specifically requires that the ‘court shall cause a notice of the petition to
be published at the expense of the petitioner x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> at least thirty days prior to the date of hearing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.‘ (Sec. 13, R.A. No. 26.)</blockquote>
