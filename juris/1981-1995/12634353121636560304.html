<p class="BODY">Appellant's alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">companion,
</span>John Doe @ "Bammy," remains at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">At his arraignment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>24
August 1986, the appellant pleaded not guilty.  Thereafter, trial proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented five (5) witnesses, namely Joselita
Lusico, Eulalia Lusico, Eddie Amante, Lt. Col. Desiderio  Moraleda and Pat. Emerito Isidro.  The defense, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on </span>the other hand, presented as its witnesses Atty. Misael
Villanueva and appellant Gorgonio Buntan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the Appellee's
Brief as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"On February 2, 1986, between the hours of 1 and 2 in the
afternoon, Eddie Amante was watching TV and drinking 'White Castle' whisky with
Crisguno Lusico at the latter's residence located at 963 S. Policarpio St.,
Navotas, Metro Manila (pp. 3-4, TSN, July 7, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">At that time, Lusico's sister, 14-year old Joselita, was in front
of said house selling junk food or 'sitseria' as she called it (pp. 2-3, TSN,
April 16, 1986).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Appellant's co-accused, identified only by his alias Bammy, was
walking along Policarpio St. and passed by Joselita who was tending her
goods.  He stopped in front of Lusico's
house, peeped through the window and left (p. 5, TSN, April 16, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">A few moments later, Bammy returned together with appellant.  Bammy again peeped through the screened
window, nodded his head, pulled out a gun and without any hesitation, fired of
Lusico four (4) times.  Appellant was
standing behind Bammy, looking out for people who might pass by (pp. 5-8,
supra; pp. 4-6, TSN, July 7, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">Eulalia Lusico, sister-in-law of Lusico, who was then at the second
floor of the house, looked through the window upon hearing the gun
reports.  She saw a man tucking a gun in
his waist.  This man was accompanied by
an old man who had white hair, a stooped posture and who walked quite slowly
(pp. 8-9, TSN, May 24, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">After the shooting incident, Bammy and appellant left and walked
casually along Policarpio street, a small alley (p. 20, ibid; p. 20, TSN, April
16, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">During that incident, Joselita who was merely an [sic] <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(1) </span>arm-length away from Bammy and
three (3) arms-length from appellant, was stuned [sic] by the occurence
[sic].  She ran inside their house only
when the duo left (pp. <i>7-</i>9<i>, </i>TSN, April 16, 1986).  Together with her sister-in-law Ela (Eulalia
Lusico), brother Romy and Eddie Amante, she approached her fallen brother, who
was then bleeding as a result of the gun shot wounds inflicted by Bammy (p. 17,
ibid).  The victim, though fallen by gun
shot wounds, told his sister Joselita that it was Bammy shot [sic] him and that
he was accompanied by appellant (pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">17Â­-</span>18,
ibid).  Eulalia also heard what the
victim said because she and her sister-in-law Joselita were then embracing the
fallen victim (pp. 20-21, TSN, May 24, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">Eulalia Lusico and Romy Lusico then brought the victim to the Tondo
General Hospital (p. 21, ibid; p. 11, TSN, April 16, 1986).  Joselita went to Balintawak, Quezon City to
inform Leticia L. Dellusa, her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">sister </span>bout
the shooting incident (p. 11, TSN, April 16, 1986).  The victim died before any medical attention could be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">given at the hospital (p. 21, TSN, May 24,
1986).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">As testified to by the PC Crime Laboratory medico-legal officer,
Col. Desiderio Moraleda, the victim sustained four (4) gun shot wounds, two (2)
on the right side of the chest, one (1) on the left buttocks [sic] and another
on the right palm.  No exit wounds were
observed.  Four (4) caliber .38 slugs
were recovered on the cadaver of the victim.  The medico-legal officer observed that the two (2) gun shot wounds on
the chest were fatal, could result to instantaneous death, about five (5) to
ten (10) minutes thereafter and were inflicted from a distance of about 24
inches.  Cause of death was hemorrhage
as a result of gun shot wounds (pp. 20-19, TSN, October 27, 1986).</p>

<p class="2Q">It was only the day following the incident, or on February 3, 1986
that appellant was apprehended by police operatives.  Appellant was then playing mahjong at the house of a certain Mang
Elang when three (3) policemen arrived at about 1 to 1:30 in the afternoon and
informed him that the Chief was inviting him for questioning (pp. 4-5, TSN,
April 18, 1988).  At the police station,
appellant was confronted and identified by Joselita and Eulalia Lusico as the
person who accompanied Bammy when the latter shot the victim on February 2,
1986 (p. 21, TSN, April 16, 1986)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find this summary to be fully supported by the transcripts of
the stenographic notes of the prosecution witnesses' testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, appellant testified that on 2 February 1986,
between the hours of 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, he was at the
house of Atty. Misael Villanueva at No. 158 Tangos, Navotas eating, drinking
and discussing the approaching "snap" elections.  Appellant was a leader of the Kilusang
Bagong Lipunan (KBL).  He claimed that
he arrived at the Villanueva residence at around 11:30 o'clock in the morning
and left only at 4:30 o'clock later that afternoon.  The following day, 3 February 1986, while he was playing
"mahjong" at the "Mahjongan of Mang Eleng" at Tangos,
Navotas, three (3) policemen, including a certain Pat. Isidro, arrived and
invited him to go with them to the police station for questioning.  The said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">invitation </span>was supposedly extended by their chief.  Appellant was then brought to the Navotas
police station and was there informed about his supposed involvement in the
earlier shooting incident.  He was
presented with a copy of the sworn statement of Joselita Lusico which was
prepared the evening of the incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's witness, Atty. Misael Villanueva, formerly an
executive assistant in the Reparations Commission and presently in semi-retirement
as a personnel officer of the Municipality of Navotas, testified that the
appellant was in his residence in Navotas on 2 February 1986 from 11:00 o'clock
in the morning until 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, appellant contends that the
circumstances upon which the trial court based its finding of conspiracy and
conclusion of his participation in the crime "do not partake the [sic]
nature of clear, convincing evidence of conspiracy."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
He alleges that there was no proof presented to show any common plan and
purpose.  Nor was any evidence submitted
to indicate that he had performed any overt act to ensure the consummation of
the crime.  He states that no motive on
his part was likewise shown.  On the
other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General maintains that it is not
correct for the appellant to surmise that conspiracy can be proven only by
direct evidence.  Invoking <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People vs. Alvarez</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>it asserts that conspiracy may be
proven through a series of acts done in pursuance of a common unlawful purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his second assigned error, appellant impugns the credibility
of the prosecution witnesses and their testimonies, and claims that the said
witnesses' versions of the event are inherently improbable "when viewed in
the light of human experience."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the third assigned error, appellant claims that his
identification by the prosecution witnesses at the police station was done in
an irregular manner; that there was no police line-up and that the witnesses
knew beforehand that the person they were to identify was Buntan and not Bammy;
and that the manner in which he was identified infringed on his right to
counsel and to remain silent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth assigned error, appellant admits that alibi is
the weakest of defenses but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">insists, </span>nonetheless,
that it should be given importance and credence in this case because the
evidence for the prosecution is itself weak and unconvincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last assigned error is merely a conclusion derived from the
appellant's analysis that the evidence for the prosecution is<i> </i>insufficient
and doubtful.</p>

<p class="BODY">As We see it, the core issue in this case is<i> </i>whether or
not conspiracy existed between the appellant and the triggerman --
"Bammy" -- who still remains at large.  Without a finding of conspiracy, an acquittal would be inevitable
considering that the appellant had no actual or direct participation in the
shooting of the victim.  He just
happened to be the companion of "Bammy" when the latter returned to
the victim's residence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy exists when two (2) or more persons come to an
agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
To establish conspiracy, it is not essential that there be proof of a previous
agreement to commit a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">crime; </span>it
is sufficient that the malefactors shall have acted in concert pursuant to the
same objective.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
While proof of the agreement need not rest on direct evidence, the agreement
itself may be inferred from the conduct of the parties, disclosing a common
understanding among them with respect to the commission of the offense,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
or may be shown by acts and circumstances from which may logically be inferred
the existence of a common design to commit the offense charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, no<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>direct
evidence to prove conspiracy was shown.  Nor are We convinced, from a reading of the transcripts of stenographic
notes, that the appellant's conduct during the shooting incident betrays
confederacy and a common understanding between the two (2) accused in the
commission of the offense.  Although the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses sufficiently established that the
appellant was with "Bammy" when the latter returned to the residence
of the victim and shot him, there is a paucity of evidence to convince Us that
the appellant shared a common intent with "Bammy" or that both had a
common purpose or design.  The
prosecution's thesis that the appellant "posted himself a little distance
away, about 2-3 arms-length from Bammy as a look-out for on-comers [sic],"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
is implausible.  It is to be observed
that such a postulation is based on the testimony of Joselita Lusico, the
victim's 14-year old sister, that the appellant was "observing who will be
coming."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Firstly, there is no evidence of any prior meeting between the appellant and
"Bammy," or of any conversation had between them before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">shooting.  </span>Secondly, there is a dearth of evidence to show any specific act
or conduct on the part of the appellant to suggest that he had indeed acted as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">a </span>look-out.  Finally, it must be stressed that "Bammy" had earlier
proceeded by himself to the victim's residence and peeped through the window in
an apparent move to find out if the victim was there.  He then left -- to get his firearm -- and returned soon after to
shoot the victim.  A look-out was
completely unnecessary under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's mere presence at the scene of the crime when the
killing was perpetrated cannot therefore, by itself, be considered as an
indication of the existence of a conspiracy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On this score alone, appellant's acquittal may forthwith be
decreed.  However, We find it necessary
to discuss the other important assigned errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant impugns the credibility of the prosecution witnesses
and their testimonies by maintaining that the latter's versions of the events
are inherently improbable "when viewed in the light of ordinary human
experience."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the appellant's assertion, there is nothing
improbable in the testimonies of the principal witnesses for the
prosecution.  Not only were they able to
identify the appellant, they were also able to clearly describe the physical
features of the triggerman and his acts preceding the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of the failure to conduct a police line-up for the
appellant's identification, We hereby reiterate that there is no law requiring
a police line-up as an essential requisite for a proper identification.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the identities of Buntan and "Bammy" were ascertained
by the police authorities on the basis of the witnesses' accounts which
specifically mentioned the names "Bammy" and "Gonying," the

There is no showing that Buntan was ever investigated by the police.  Also, no evidence, supposedly obtained from
the appellant's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">custodial </span>encounter
with the police, was even presented during trial.  As borne out by the records, Buntan was not interrogated at all
and no statement or confession was extracted from him.  All that the police investigators did was to
show him Joselita's sworn statement identifying him as one of two (2) suspects
in the killing of her brother.  Buntan's
own testimony during trial does not show that his right to counsel or to remain
silent was ever violated.</p>
