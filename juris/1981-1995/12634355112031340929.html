				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant, Rudy Fronda, together with Reynaldo Agcaoili were charged
with murder before Branch 10 of the Regional Trial Court of Cagayan in two
separate informations, Criminal Cases No. 10-304 and 10-308 alleged to have
been committed in conspiracy with several John Does.  Appellant and his co-accused were accused of killing the brothers
Esminio and Edwin Balaan of Allacapan, Cagayan in the two identically worded
informations alleging the offense to have been committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about June 11, 1986, in the municipality of
Allacapan, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable
Court, the said accused, Reynaldo Agcaoili and Rudy Fronda, together with
several John Does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">who were not
identified, armed with guns and sharp-pointed instruments, conspiring together
and helping one another, with intent to kill, with evident premeditation, with
treachery, in consideration of a price or reward and with the aid of armed men,
forcibly took one Edwin Balaan from his residence and brought him to the
mountains of Barangay Tulong, Allacapan, Cagayan, and there and then, the
accused, in pursuance of their conspiracy, did then and there wilfully,
unlawfully, and feloniously assault, attack, torture and stabbed (sic) the said
Edwin Balaan/Esmenio Balaan inflicting upon him wounds on his body which caused
his death." (Rollo, pp. 122-123)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 29, 1989, Reynaldo Agcaoili was arrested but was
subsequently released on bail two days after.  On June 2, 1989, appellant Rudy Fronda was arrested and detained.  Upon arraignment, both appellant and accused
Reynaldo Agcaoili pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder.  Thereafter, trial ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1991, the trial court promulgated its decision
convicting appellant and acquitting Reynaldo Agcaoili of the crime charged, the
decretal portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, under cool<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>reflection
and fortified<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>by the balm of clear
judicial conscience, the Court enters a verdict of acquittal in favor of the
accused Reynaldo Agcaoili for the crime of murder as charged, in both Criminal
Cases Nos. 10-304 and 10-308, with costs de oficio.  His bailbond is cancelled and the documents submitted in support
thereof may now be withdrawn from the records under proper receipt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As against the accused Rudy Fronda, the Court finds him
guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by indispensable cooperation for
the crime of murder as charged in both Criminal Cases Nos. 10-304 and 10-308,
and sentences him to suffer in each case, the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA,
with all the accesory penalties provided for by law and to pay the costs.  He is ordered to each pay (sic) the heirs of
the deceased Edwin (Eduardo) Balaan and Esmenio Balaan, the amounts of:</blockquote>

in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the service hereof, the accused Rudy Fronda shall be
entitled to the full length of time, he underwent preventive imprisonment,
provided he voluntarily agreed in writing to abide by the same disciplinary
rules imposed upon convicted prisoners, otherwise, he shall be credited to only

<blockquote>"MORE, there being two (2) perpetual penalties imposed upon
the accused Rudy Fronda, the maximum simultaneous service of his sentence shall
in no case exceed forty (40) years.  (Art. 70, RPC, amended by Com. Act No. 217, threefold rule).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (Rollo, pp. 76-77)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as found by the trial court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 6:00 o'clock in the morning of June 11, 1986, the
deceased Eduardo (Edwin) Balaan and Esminio Balaan who are brothers, were taken
by seven (7) armed men in fatigue uniform with long firearms, suspected to be
NPA members, accompanied by accused Rudy Fronda and Roderick Padua from the
house of one Ferminio Balaan, at Barangay Cataratan, Allacapan, Cagayan.  The said Rudy Fronda and Roderick Padua are
residents of the same place.  The armed
men tied the hands of the deceased at their back lying down face downÂ­ward, in
front of the house of Ferminio Balaan.  The armed men together with Roderick Padua and Rudy Fronda proceeded
towards sitio Tulong, Cataratan, Allacapan, Cagayan passing through the
ricefields (taking along with them the Balaan brothers).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"Accused Rudy Fronda
testified that on the night of June 10, 1986 he was taken by the NPA's from his
house, accompanied by Robert Peralta, alias Ka Jun and Roderick Padua, to look
for the Balaan brothers.  They were
around nine (9) NPA's with them.  They
found Edwin and Esmenio Balaan, </span>at the house of Ferminio Balaan, a
brother.  They tied their wrists/hands
and brought them to the mountain at Sitio Tulong, Cataratan, Allapacan,
Cagayan.  After that, the NPA's
instructed them to go home, but in the afternoon of the same day June 11, 1986,
Robert Peralta, alias Ka Jun, sent Elmer Martinez, Orlando Gonzales, George
Perlata and Librado Duran to get him and further he was ordered to get a spade
and a crowbar.  They were ordered to dig
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>hole in the mountain, one (1)
kilometer away from his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"On March 21, 1989,
the bodies or remains of the Balaan brothers were exhumed by the 17th Infantry
Battalion, under Capt. Benedicto.  Afterwhich, the remains, (bones) were brought to the house of one
Freddie Arevalo, a relative of the deceased, at Barangay Cataratan, where they
were laid in state for the wake." (Rollo, pp. 27-29)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the trial court made a lengthy enumeration of
established facts and circumstances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">which
was made the basis of the conviction of </span>appellant, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)  Appellant and Roderick
Padua, an NPA member were the ones who pointed the house where the brothers
Balaan were to be found, 2) appellant and Roderick Padua accompanied the members
of the armed group to said house, and tied the victims' hands, 3) appellant was
handed a hunting knife by one of the armed men when they left the house, 4)
appellant joined the members of the armed group in bringing the victims to a
forested area in the mountains, 5) it was appellant who provided the spade and
crowbar used in digging the hole where the Balaan brothers were buried, 6)
appellant was the one who pointed the location where the victims' bodies were
buried, 7) appellant, for a period of more than three (3) years, failed to
report the incident to the authorities, and 8) appellant did not in any way
object, when he was ordered to tie the hands of the victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing, the trial court declared:</p>

<blockquote>"In fine, all of<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>these<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>circumstances constitute an unbroken chain
which leads to a fair conclusion that accused Rudy Fronda is guilty as a
principal by indispensable cooperation (People vs. Colinares, 163 SCRA 313), <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">even as the same circumstances are
inconsistent with each other, and at the same time inconsistent with any other
hypothesis, except that of guilty (People vs. Trinidad 162 SCRA 714), all cited
in the recent case of People vs. Tiongson, G.R. No. 89823, June 19, 1991).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"It is crystal clear
and the conclusion is inescapable that his cooperation was indeed indispensable
in the consumation of the crime charged, without which it would not have been
accomplished, (Art. 17, No. 3, RPC).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"Accused Rudy Fronda
shared the guilty purpose and encouraged and abetted the crime by his actuations
as above illustrated, even though he may have taken no part in the
execution.  The chain of circumstances
as narrated above will show that he has rendered the required assistance
intentionally and knowingly, which led to the execution of the felony.  His external acts more than explain his
participation as principal by indispensable cooperation.  Such external overt acts, are more than
significant enough constituting convincing proof leading to the ineluctable
finding that accused Rudy Fronda is guilty as such." (Rollo, pp. 74-75)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in">Appellant assails the decision of the
trial court, setting forth the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY
OF MURDER IN TWO COUNTS AND SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION
PERPETUA IN EACH COUNT</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(Appellant's Brief, p. 1)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant maintains that the prosecution was not able to
present evidence to prove his participation in the killing of the brothers
Balaan.  The defense submits that
appellant was merely taken by the armed men as a "pointer" and as
such, he could not be considered as a principal by indispensable cooperation
for the reason that the armed men could have taken other persons to perform the
acts done by appellant.  Furthermore,
appellant interposes the exempting circumstance of uncontrollable fear (Art. 12
[6] RPC) claiming that all his acts were performed under the impulse of
uncontrollable fear and to save his life.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case hinges on the issue of whether or not accused-appellant
could be convicted as a principal by indispensable cooperation through
circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 3, Article 17, of the Revised Penal Code considers as
principals by indispensable cooperation "those who cooperate in the
commission of the offense by another act without which it could not have been
accomplished".  Its requisites are
(1) participation of the subject accused in the criminal resolution and (2)
performance by him of another act indispensable to the accomplishment of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records show that appellant's participation in the commission of
the crime consisted of:  (1) leading the
members of the armed group to the house where the victims were found (2) tying
the victims' hands and (3) digging the grave where the victims were
buried.  However, it has been
established through the testimony of Alex Utrera, a former member of the NPA,
that appellant was only picked-up by the armed men for the purpose of pointing
the residence of the victims.  The armed
men never disclosed their purpose in looking for the brothers Balaan who were
former members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines nor did the armed men
inform appellant of their plan to abduct and kill the two brothers. </p>

<p class="BODY">Save for the open admission <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of
</span>appellant that he was an NPA "supporter", no incontrovertible
proof was adduced by the prosecution supporting the conclusion that appellant
agreed with the members of the armed group to kill the brothers Balaan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, prosecution witnesses Freddie Arevalo and Gilbert
Viernes testified that the members of the armed group were accompanied by,
aside from appellant, another barriomate, Roderick Padua, known to be a member
of the NPA (Tsn p. 8 &amp; 76).  Undoubtedly, even without appellant's participation, the assailants
could have easily located the Balaan brothers thru the assistance of Roderick
Padua.  Taking account of the number of
the assailants alone, it is apparent that the armed men could have nevertheless
committed the crime easily without the appellant abetting the commission
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts performed by appellant are not, by themselves,
indispensable to the killing of the brothers Balaan.  As aforesaid to be considered as a principal by indispensable
cooperation, there must be direct participation in the criminal design by
another act without which the crime could not have been committed.  We note that the prosecution failed to
present any evidence tending to establish appellant's conspiracy with the evil
designs of the members of the NPA armed group.  Neither was it established that appellant's acts were of such importance
that the crime would not have been committed without him or that he
participated in the actual killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, appellant cannot therefore be considered
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>principal by indispensable
cooperation.  The trial court,
therefore, erred when it found appellant guilty as a principal by indispensable
cooperation.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, appellant's act of joining the armed men in going to the
mountains, and his failure to object to their unlawful orders, or show any
reluctance in obeying the same, may be considered as circumstances evincing his
concurrence with the objectives of the malefactors and had effectively supplied
them with material and moral aid, thereby making him as an accomplice.  He cannot with candor, claim that he was
unaware of the evil intentions of the armed men which may have been the case
had appellant merely guided the group to locate the victims' abodes.  On the contrary, appellant himself tied the
victims' hands and even joined the armed men in taking the victims to the
hills.  Appellant's complicity is made
more manifest by the fact that without any justifiable reason he failed to
report the incident to the authorities for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">a </span>period of more than three (3) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 18 of the Revised Penal Code provides that an accomplice
is one who, not being a principal, "cooperates in the execution of the
offense by previous or simultaneous acts".  Under this provision, a person is considered as an accomplice if
his role in the perpetration of the crime is of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">a </span>minor character.  To be
convicted as such, it is necessary that he be aware of the criminal intent of
the principal and thereby cooperates knowingly or intentionally by supplying
material or moral aid for the efficacious execution of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled that if there is ample evidence of criminal
participation but a doubt exists as to the nature of liability, courts should
resolve to favor the milder form of responsibility, that of an accomplice.  (People vs. Doctolero, 193 SCRA 632, [1991]
citing People vs. Torejas, 43 SCRA  158,
[1972])</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant cannot claim the exempting circumstance of
uncontrollable fear (Art. 12, par. 6, RPC).  Fear in order to be valid should be based on a real, imminent or
reasonable fear for one's life or limb (People vs. Abanes, 73 SCRA 44,
[1976]).  In the case at bar, records
indicate that appellant was seen being handed by and receiving from one of the
armed men a hunting knife.  Also, as
aforesaid, appellant was not able to explain his failure to report the incident
to the authorities for more than three (3) years.  These circumstances, among others, establish the fact that
appellant consciously concurred with the acts of the assailants.  In order that the circumstance of
uncontrollable fear may apply, it is necessary that the compulsion be of such a
character as to leave no opportunity to escape or self-defense in equal
combat.  (People vs. Loreno, 130 SCRA 311,
[1984]) Appellant had the opportunity to escape when he was ordered by the
armed men to go home after bringing the victims to the mountains.  He did not.  Instead he joined the armed men when required to bring a spade with
which he was ordered to dig the grave.  Appellant also chose to remain silent for more than three (3) years
before reporting the killing to the authorities.  Based on these circumstances, We hold that the contemporaneous
and subsequent acts of appellant can not be regarded as having been done under
the impulse of uncontrollable fear.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant also argues
that the trial court erred </span>when it convicted him of the crime charged,
alleging that no evidence was presented to prove any circumstance that would
qualify the crime committed to murder.  Appellant's argument is devoid of merit.  Paragraph 1, Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that
any person who kills another, taking advantage of superior strength shall be
guilty of murder, and shall be punished by reclusion temporal in the maximum
period to death.  It is manifest that
the group of assailants was composed of seven (7) armed men, and two (2)
civilians including appellant Fronda.  It had been repeatedly held that the number of assailants, if armed, may
be considered as a qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength.  It is indubitable that assailants
deliberately used superior force of such nature as to be clearly out of
proportion to the means or defense available to the victims People vs. Tandoc
(40 Phil. 954 [1920]) and People vs. Verzo (21 SCRA 1403 [1967]).  The assailants took advantage of their
numbers in order to ensure that the brothers Balaan who are said to be former
members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines would not be able to put up any
defense.  The crime thus committed is
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Be that as it may, and
after considering the </span>attendant circumstances, We hold that appellant is
guilty beyond reasonable doubt as accomplice to the crime charged i.e.
murder.  As such, the proper imposable
penalty is one degree lower than that prescribed for murder (Art. 52, Revised
Penal Code).  The penalty for murder is <i>reclusion
temporal </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in its</span> maximum
period to <i>death </i>(Art. 248, RPC).  One degree lower is <i>prision mayor</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> in its maximum</span> period to <i>reclusion temporal medium </i>(Art.
61 (3), RPC).  There being no mitigating
nor aggravating circumstances which attended the commission of the crime, the
penalty impossable under the law should be applied in its medium period (Art.
64 [1], RPC) and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, appellant is hereby
sentenced in each case to suffer imprisonment ranging <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">from eight (8) years and one (1) day of <i>prision mayor </i></span>as
minimum to fourteen (14) years eight (8) months and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum.<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>
