and Secretary of the Budget and Management, Respondents," (Annex
"A"; pp. 25-31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), petitioner's Motion
for Reconsideration thereof having been denied by the Court of Appeals in its
Resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> dated August 24, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex "B"; p. 33, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rollo</span></span><span style="">)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> facts of the case
are:</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Echeche</span>
was employed at the Bureau <span style="">of </span>Mines
(now Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences) on <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was, however, included in the lists of alleged undesirable and unfit public
servants who were purged under Letter of Instruction No. 309 dated <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a letter-request for reinstatement with the Appeals Committee
created under Executive Order No. 370, series of 1975, which was forwarded by
the Office of the President to then Minister of Natural Resources in a
letter-referral dated <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="2">February <span style="">8, </span>1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by another letter-request
dated July 7, 1982 which was again forwarded to the Minister of Natural
Resources and endorsed to the Bureau of Mines. The Bureau of Mines did not give
any comment on the petition, neither the Minister of Natural Resources.</p>

<p class="BODY">Three years lapsed before his letter-request was initially acted
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Presidential Staff Director
forwarded to then Secretary Jose <span class="SpellE">Leido</span>, Jr., of the
Ministry of Natural Resources pertinent papers, relative to the petitions for
reinstatement of purged officials and employees of the Department, for action
and disposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 26, 1985, a Memorandum for the Minister of Natural
Resources was issued by Moreno B. Cruz, Assistant Secretary for Legal Affairs
ordering the reinstatement of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Echeche</span> with payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
"because he was removed from the service without cause." (Annex
"F", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 77)</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in a Resolution dated May 2, 1986, the Assistant
Secretary for Legal Affairs, Alexander C. Castro, of the Ministry of Natural
Resources, signing with authority from the Minister, ordered reinstatement, in
the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, petitioner shall be reinstated as legal officer in
the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
during the time of separation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
he shall undergo a physical and psychological examination to determine his
fitness as a legal officer; otherwise, petitioner shall be retired for reasons
of disability or incapacity and be paid his corresponding benefits."
(Comment of the Office of Solicitor General, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 108).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 18, 1986, <span style="">petitioner
was </span>reemployed as Legal Officer III by the Director of Mines and
Geo-Sciences; he was not reinstated to his former position because the
functions of Legal Officer II were transferred to Legal Officer III.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sought payment of his back salaries, allowances, and
bonuses, pursuant to the Resolution of the Department of Natural
Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of Mines and Geo?Sciences
and Minister Carlos G<span style="">. </span><span style="">Dominguez </span>of the Department of Natural
Resources recommended payment, thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Ibid., p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 109)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Department of Budget and Management referred the matter to
the Office of the Executive Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Office of the Executive Secretary denied request for payment <span style="">because </span>petitioner was merely
reemployed, not reinstated as he was never recommended by the Appeals Committee
for reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His new appointment
was made pursuant to the grant of executive clemency and LOI 647 which confined
such presidential clemency to reemployment not reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied by Deputy
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Magdangal</span> B. Elma, in the
following tenor:</p>

<p class="BODY">"Based on the foregoing, the request of <span class="SpellE">Echeche</span>
for payment of back salaries, allowances, and bonuses was denied as he was then
'considered under suspension without pay'." (Ibid., p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 110<span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1988, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span class="SpellE">Echeche</span> filed a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> directly
with the Supreme Court seeking the annulment of the decision of the Office of
the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court
referred the case to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed <span style="">the petition for </span>lack of merit stating that "there is no
legal basis for granting the petitioner his request for back salaries,
allowances and <span style="">bonuses" (Annex
"A", </span>Decision of Court of Appeals, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 31).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the Court of
Appeals denied the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in his Reply to Comment, submits the following
issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING
THAT THERE <span style="">IS </span>NO LEGAL BASIS FOR
GRANTING PETITIONER'S REQUEST FOR (SIC) BACKSALARIES, ALLOWANCES AND BONUSES.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING
THAT RESPONDENT-PUBLIC OFFICIALS DID NOT COMMIT ANY ERROR IN DENYING
PETITIONER'S REQUEST FOR THE PAYMENT OF BACK SALARIES, BONUSES AND ALLOWANCES.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING
THE CASE OF "CLEMENTE VS. COA, G.R. No. L-47793, March 30, 1984" IN
THIS CASE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A<span style=""> </span>QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE NOT HERETOFORE
DECIDED BY THE HON. SUPREME COURT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p.
128, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the 1973
Constitution, Article XII-B, Section 3, provides that "no officer or
employee in the Civil Service shall be suspended or dismissed except for cause
as provided by law." This provision guarantees that the suspension or
dismissal can be made only "for cause as provided by law." Dismissal
for cause does not necessarily mean that the dismissed officer or employee must
be charged in court or administratively and must be given his day in court or
afforded due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal
for cause implies that there is reasonable ground provided by law to justify
the dismissal of an officer or employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar,
petitioner was dismissed under Letter of Instruction No. 309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends that Letter of
Instruction No. 309 is </span>unconstitutional because it violates the above
constitutional mandate. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He further
argues that there was no valid cause to purge him because "there was no
pending administrative, civil, or criminal charges against him."
(Petition, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11)</p>

<p class="BODY">Said issue has long been settled in the case of <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> vs. Commission on Audit (128 SCRA 297), which the
appellate court correctly applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that case, the petitioner was also purged under LOI 309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no pending<span style=""> </span>administrative charge, or any disciplinary action against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually he was reinstated, and
he also sought the payment of back salaries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His request was denied by the executive department, which denial was
affirmed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Supreme Court, through Justice (later Chief Justice) <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>,
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"As we see it, the "September 1975 Purge" is part of
the process of cleaning up the government machineries, which upon the
imposition of martial law, the President had taken to task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>xxx Too well known fact is the evil that
plagued government service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Graft and
corruption among government employees and officers were too rampant in almost
all offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Numerous, public officials,
using their high positions for personal gain at the expense of the public, have
not lived up to the public trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
program of reforms of the President in the New Society by instilling discipline
in the people, particularly those in the government service, and by weeding out
from the service employees and officials <span style="">considered </span>notoriously undesirable were envisioned as an answer to
the long felt need for restoring the confidence of the people in the
government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The constitutionality of LOI 309 was settled in the same case:</p>

<blockquote>"The President, of course, did not order the "September
1975 purge" by a snap of his fingers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As adverted to earlier, the September, 1975 purge was made pursuant to
Letter of Instruction No. 309, series of 1975 which was issued under the
authority of Section 9, Article XVII of the Constitution, which vests upon the
incumbent President the power to remove officials and employees of the existing
government. Pertinent portion of Section 9 reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Sec. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All officials
and employees in the existing Government of the Republic of the Philippines
shall continue in office unless otherwise provided by law or decree by the
incumbent President of the Philippines xxx."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no reason for Us to deviate from settled rules and
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LOI 309 is
constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments of petitioner are premised on the
unconstitutionality of LOI 309.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
request for payment of back salaries, bonuses and allowances depends upon his
argument that his "purge" from the public service in 1973 was in
gross violation of his constitutional rights to due process and therefore
patently illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">shown in </span>the previous discussion, LOI
309 <span style="">is constitutional, </span>hence the
dismissal of Atty. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> P. </span><span class="SpellE">Echeche</span>
was not illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's right <span style="">to </span>back
salaries, <span style="">allowances </span>and bonuses
is without legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Director of
the Bureau of Mine<span style="">s</span> in
dismissing <span style="">petitioner </span>pursuant <span style="">to </span>LOI 309, cannot be said <span style="">to have </span>acted in bad faith and with
grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no ill will or personal malice<span style=""> in</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">dismissing petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of</span><span style=""> proof </span><span style="">that the Director acted in bad faith and with</span><span style=""> grave </span><span style="">abuse of discretion, petitioner is not
entitled </span><span style="">to </span>back salaries, bonuses and allowances.<span style=""> </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Octot</span> </span>vs. Ibanez, et al., 111 SCRA 79).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Letter
</span><span style="">of </span>Instruction 647 gave
an <span style="">opportunity
</span>for the petitioner to be employed back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Section
</span>1 of LOI 647 states:</p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>All
officials and employees who<span style=""> </span><span style="">were </span>not
recommended for <span style="">reinstatement </span>by
the Appeals Committee <span style="">but </span><span style="">are </span>qualified
to reenter the <span style="">government </span>service
are hereby granted executive<span style=""> </span>clemency
for purpose of reemployment<span style=""> </span>subject
to Civil Service <span style="">Law </span><span style="">and Rules </span>if <span style="">recommended </span>by their <span style="">respective </span>department heads."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The
</span><span style="">grant of </span>executive
clemency under LOI <span style="">647 was </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">the </span>purpose of
reemployment, not<span style=""> reinstatement</span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Reemployment implies that one is hired
anew,<span style=""> </span>which
does not carry with it payment of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">backwages</span></span><span style="">.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To bolster his position in his last assignment of errors, petitioner
argues that the Court of Appeals ruled on an order which has already become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He reasoned that the order of the Minister of Natural Resources,
reinstating the petitioner and ordering the payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
has attained finality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of
Budget and Management failed to file any motion for <span style="">reconsideration </span>from the approval of payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arguments of petitioner are not supported
by facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of the Minister of
Natural Resources did not attain finality, in the sense that it may no longer
be reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acts of Ministers (now
Cabinet Secretaries) are <span class="SpellE"><span style="">reviewable</span></span><span style=""> </span>by
the President in the exercise of his power of control.</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall have control of all the <span style="">executive </span>departments, bureaus and
offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He shall ensure that the laws
be faithfully executed." (1987 Constitution, Art. VII, Sec. 17)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President
shall have control of the ministries." (1973 <span style="">Constitution, Art. </span><span style="">VII)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Control means "the power of an
officer to alter or modify or nullify, or set aside what a subordinate officer
had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the
former for that of the latter." (<st1:city><st1:place>Hebron</st1:place></st1:city>
vs. Reyes, 104 Phil. 175) The President can, by virtue of his power of control,
review, modify, alter or nullify any action, or decision of his subordinate in
the executive departments, bureaus or offices under him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Oliveros-Torre</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">Bayot</span>, 58 SCRA 272; <span class="SpellE">Ang-Angco</span>
vs. Castillo, et al., 118 Phil. 1468).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He can exercise this power <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">proprio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">without
need of any appeal from any party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Oliveros-Torre</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span>, supra).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The President is not
expected to perform in person all the multifarious executive and </span>administrative
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the Executive
Secretary <span style="">is </span>an auxiliary unit
which assists the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under our
constitutional <span style="">set-up, the Executive
Secretary acts for and in behalf of the President:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and by authority of the President, he has
undisputed jurisdiction to affirm, modify, or even reverse any order of the
Secretary of Natural Resources and other Cabinet Secretaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the Executive Secretary acts "by
authority of the President" his decision is that of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Lacson-Magallanes</span>
Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Pano</span>, 21 SCRA 895).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="">In
the case at bar, the Deputy Executive Secretary denied the request of the
petitioner for payment of back salaries, allowances and </span>bonuses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Office of the Executive
Secretary must be given full faith and credit by our courts as an act of the
Chief Executive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not matter, though,
that considering the extensive range of authority of the Executive Secretary,
the decisions of such office which are attributable to the Executive Secretary
have been performed by the Assistant or Deputy Executive Secretaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Barte</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dichoso</span>, 47 SCRA 77).</p>
