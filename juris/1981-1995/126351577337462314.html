				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i> to annul the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> and orders issued by respondent Ombudsman, requiring petitioners Nerio Rogado and Elisa Rivera, as chief accountant and record custodian, respectively, of the Economic Intelligence and Investigation Bureau (EIIB) to produce "all documents relating to Personal Services Funds for the year 1988 and all evidence, such as vouchers (salary) for the whole plantilla of EIIB for 1988" and to enjoin him from enforcing his orders.<br><br>Petitioner Jose T. Almonte was formerly Commissioner of the EIIB, while Villamor C. Perez is Chief of the EIIB's Budget and Fiscal Management Division.&nbsp; The subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> was issued by the Ombudsman in connection with his investigation of an anonymous letter alleging that funds representing savings from unfilled positions in the EIIB had been illegally disbursed.&nbsp; The letter, purporting to have been written by an employee of the EIIB and a concerned citizen, was addressed to the Secretary of Finance, with copies furnished several government offices, including the Office of the Ombudsman.<br><br>The letter reads in pertinent parts:<br><br><ol><li>These are the things that I have been observing.&nbsp; During the implementation of E.O. 127 on May 1, 1988, one hundred ninety (190) personnel were dismissed.&nbsp; Before that implementation, we had a monthly savings of P500,000.00 from unfilled plantilla position plus the implementation of RA 6683 wherein seventy (70) regular employees availed a total amount of P1,400,000.00 was saved from the government monthly.&nbsp; The question is, how do they used or disbursed this savings?&nbsp; The EIIB has a syndicate headed by the Chief of Budget Division who is manipulating funds and also the brain of the so called "ghost agents" or the "Emergency Intelligence Agents" (EIA).&nbsp; The Commissioner of EIIB has a biggest share on this.&nbsp; Among his activities are:<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">a) </div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"><div align="JUSTIFY">Supporting RAM wherein he is involved.

No. 127, since the DBM provided allocations for only the remaining 947 personnel.&nbsp; He said that the disbursement of funds for the plantilla positions for "overt" and "covert" personnel had been cleared by the COA and that the high-powered firearms had been issued for the protection of EIIB personnel attending court hearings and the Finance Officer in withdrawing funds from the banks.<br><br>The Graft Investigation Officer of the Ombudsman's office, Jose F. Saño, found the comments unsatisfactory, being "unverified and plying only on generalizations without meeting specifically the points raised by complainant as constitutive of the alleged anomalies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> He, therefore, asked for authority to conduct a preliminary investigation.&nbsp; Anticipating the grant of his request, he issued a subpoena<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> to petitioners Almonte and Perez, requiring them to submit their counter-affidavits and the affidavits of their witnesses, as well as a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> to the Chief of the ElIB's Accounting Division ordering him to bring "all documents relating to Personal Services Funds for the year 1988 and all evidence, such as vouchers (salary) for the whole plantilla of EIIB for 1988."<br><br>Petitioners Almonte and Perez moved to quash the subpoena and the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>.&nbsp; In his Order dated June 15, 1990,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> respondent Ombudsman granted the motion to quash the subpoena in view of the fact that there were no affidavits filed against petitioners.&nbsp; But he denied their motion to quash the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i>.&nbsp; He ruled that petitioners were not being forced to produce evidence against themselves, since the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> was directed to the Chief Accountant, petitioner Nerio Rogado.&nbsp; In addition the Ombudsman ordered the Chief of the Records Section of the EIIB, petitioner Elisa Rivera, to produce before the investigator "all documents relating to Personnel Service Funds, for the year 1988, and all documents, salary vouchers for the whole plantilla of the EIIB for 1988, within ten (10) days from receipt hereof."<br><br>Petitioners Almonte and Perez moved for a reconsideration, arguing that Rogado and Rivera were EIIB employees under their supervision and that the Ombudsman was doing indirectly what he could not do directly, <i>i.e</i>., compelling them (petitioners Almonte and Perez) to produce evidence against themselves.<br><br>Petitioners' motion was denied in respondent Ombudsman's order dated August 6, 1990.&nbsp; Hence, this petition which questions the orders of June 15, 1990 and August 6, 1990 of respondent Ombudsman.<br><br>To put<b> </b>this case in perspective it should be stated at the outset that it does not concern a demand by a citizen for information under the freedom of information guarantee of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Rather it concerns the power of the Office of the Ombudsman to obtain evidence in connection with an investigation conducted by it vis-a-vis the claim of privilege of an agency of the Government. Thus petitioners raise the following issues:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><ol type="I"><li>WHETHER OR NOT A CASE BROUGHT ABOUT BY AN UNSIGNED AND UNVERIFIED LETTER COMPLAINT IS AN "APPROPRIATE CASE" WITHIN THE CONCEPT OF THE CONSTITUTION IN WHICH PUBLIC RESPONDENT CAN OBLIGE PETITIONERS BY VIRTUE OF HIS SUBPOENA <span style="font-style: italic;">DUCES TECUM</span> TO PRODUCE TO HIM "ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PERSONAL SERVICES FUNDS FOR THE YEAR 1988 AND ALL EVIDENCES, SUCH AS VOUCHERS (SALARY) FOR THE WHOLE PLANTILLA OF EIIB FOR 1988."<br><br></li><li>WHETHER OR NOT "ALL DOCUMENTS RELATING TO PERSONAL SERVICES FUNDS FOR THE YEAR 1988 AND ALL EVIDENCES, SUCH AS VOUCHERS (SALARY) FOR THE WHOLE PLANTILLA OF EIIB FOR 1988" ARE CLASSIFIED AND, THEREFORE, BEYOND THE REACH OF PUBLIC RESPONDENT'S SUBPOENA<i> DUCES TECUM</i>.<br></li></ol><br style="font-weight: bold;"><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">I.</span><br></div><br>There are several subsidiary issues raised by petitioners, but the principal ones revolve on the question whether petitioners can be ordered to produce documents relating to personal services and salary vouchers of EIIB employees on the plea that such documents are classified.&nbsp; Disclosure of the documents in question is resisted on the ground that "knowledge of EIIB's documents relative to its Personal Services Funds and its plantilla . . . will necessarily [lead to] knowledge of its operations, movements, targets, strategies, and tactics and the whole of its being" and this could "destroy the EllB."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioners do not question the power of the Ombudsman to issue a subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> nor the relevancy or materiality of the documents required to be produced, to the pending investigation in the Ombudsman's office.&nbsp; Accordingly, the focus of discussion should be on the Government's claim of privilege.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A.</span><br></div><br>At common law a governmental privilege against disclosure is recognized with respect to state secrets bearing on military, diplomatic and similar matters.&nbsp; This privilege is based upon public interest of such paramount importance as in and of itself transcending the individual interests of a private citizen, even though, as a consequence thereof, the plaintiff cannot enforce his legal rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In addition, in the litigation over the Watergate tape subpoena in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the right of the President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, which it likened to "the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations." Said the Court in <i>United States v. Nixon</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The expectation of a President to the confidentiality of his conversations and correspondence, like the claim of confidentiality of judicial deliberations, for example, has all the values to which we accord deference for the privacy of all citizens and, added to those values, is the necessity for protection of the public interest in candid, objective, and even blunt or harsh opinions in Presidential decision-making. A President and those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except privately.&nbsp; These are the considerations justifying a presumptive privilege for Presidential communications.&nbsp; The privilege is fundamental to the operation of the government and inextricably rooted in the separation of powers under the Constitution. . . .<br><br>Thus, the Court for the first time gave executive privilege a constitutional status and a new name, although not necessarily a new birth.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br><blockquote>"The confidentiality of judicial deliberations" mentioned in the opinion of the Court referred to the fact that Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court and judges of lower federal courts have traditionally treated their working papers and judicial notes as private property.&nbsp; A 1977 proposal in the U.S. Congress that Justices and judges of lower federal courts "should be encouraged to make such arrangements as will assure the preservation and eventual availability of their personal papers, especially the deposit of their papers in the same depository they select for [their] Public Papers"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> was rebuffed by the Justices who, in a letter to the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information of the U.S. Senate, referred to "difficult concerns respecting the appropriate separation that must be maintained between the legislative branch and this Court."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote>There are, in addition to such privileges, statutorily-created ones such as the Government's privilege to withhold the identity of persons who furnish information of violations of laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>With respect to the privilege based on state secret, the rule was stated by the U.S. Supreme Court as follows:<br><br>Judicial control over the evidence in a case cannot be abdicated to the caprice of executive officers.&nbsp; Yet we will not go so far as to say that the court may automatically require a complete disclosure to the judge before the claim of privilege will be accepted in any case.&nbsp; It may be possible to satisfy the court, from all the circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.&nbsp; When this is the case, the occasion for the privilege is appropriate, and the court should not jeopardize the security which the privilege is meant to protect by insisting upon an examination of the evidence, even by the judge alone, in chambers. . . In each case, the showing of necessity which is made will determine how far the court should probe in satisfying itself that the occasion for invoking the privilege is appropriate. Where there is a strong showing of necessity, the claim of privilege should not be lightly accepted, but even the most compelling necessity cannot overcome the claim of privilege if the court is ultimately satisfied that military secrets are at stake.&nbsp; A fortiori, where necessity is dubious, a formal claim of privilege, made under the circumstances of this case, will have to prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>On the other hand, where the claim of confidentiality does not rest on the need to protect military, diplomatic or other national security secrets but on a general public interest in the confidentiality of his conversations, courts have declined to find in the Constitution an absolute privilege of the President against a subpoena considered essential to the enforcement of criminal laws.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">B.</span><br></div><br>In the case at bar, there is no claim that military or diplomatic secrets will be disclosed by the production of records pertaining to the personnel of the EIIB.&nbsp; Indeed, EIIB's function is the gathering and evaluation of intelligence reports and information regarding "illegal activities affecting the national economy, such as, but not limited to, economic sabotage, smuggling, tax evasion, dollar salting."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Consequently, while in cases which involve state secrets it may be sufficient to determine from the circumstances of the case that there is reasonable danger that compulsion of the evidence will expose military matters without compelling production,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> no similar excuse can be made for a privilege resting on other considerations.<br><br>Nor has our attention been called to any law or regulation which considers personnel records of the EllB as classified information.&nbsp; To the contrary, COA Circular No. 88-293, which petitioners invoke to support their contention that there is adequate safeguard against misuse of public funds, provides that the "only item of expenditure which should be treated strictly confidential" is that which refers to the "purchase of information and payment of rewards." Thus, part V, No. 7 of the Circular read:<br><br>The only item of expenditure which should be treated as strictly confidential because it falls under the category of classified information is that relating to purchase of information and payment of rewards.&nbsp; However, reasonable records should be maintained and kept for inspection of the Chairman, Commission on Audit or his duly authorized representative.&nbsp; All other expenditures are to be considered unclassified supported by invoices, receipts and other documents, and, therefore, subject to reasonable inquiry by the Chairman or his duly authorized representative.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It should be noted that the regulation requires that "reasonable records" be kept justifying the confidential or privileged character of the information relating to informers.&nbsp; There are no such reasonable records in this case to substitute for the records claimed to be confidential.<br><br>The other statutes and regulations<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> invoked by petitioners in support of their contention that the documents sought in the subpoena <i>duces tecum</i> of the Ombudsman are classified merely indicate the confidential nature of the ElIB's functions, but they do not exempt the EIIB from the duty to account for its funds to the proper authorities.&nbsp; Indeed by denying that there were savings made from certain items in the agency and alleging that the DBM had released to the EIIB only the allocations needed for the 947 personnel retained after its reorganization, petitioners in effect invited inquiry into the veracity of their claim.&nbsp; If, as petitioners claim, the subpoenaed records have been examined by the COA and found by it to be regular in all respects, there is no reason why they cannot be shown to another agency of the government which by constitutional mandate is required to look into any complaint concerning public office.<br><br>On the other hand, the Ombudsman is investigating a complaint that several items in the EIIB were filled by fictitious persons and that the allotments for these items in 1988 were used for illegal purposes.&nbsp; The plantilla and other personnel records are relevant to his investigation.&nbsp; He and his Deputies are designated by the Constitution "protectors of the people" and as such they are required by it "to act promptly on complaints in any form or manner against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>His need for the documents thus outweighs the claim of confidentiality of petitioners.&nbsp; What is more, while there might have been compelling reasons for the claim of privilege in 1988 when it was asserted by petitioners, now, seven years later, these reasons may have been attenuated, if they have not in fact ceased.&nbsp; The agents whose identities could not then be, revealed may have ceased from the service of the EIIB, while the covert missions to which they might have been deployed might either have been accomplished or abandoned.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Ombudsman's duty to investigate the complaint that there were in 1988 unfilled positions in the EIIB for which continued funding was received by its officials and put to illegal use, remains.<br><br>Above all, even if the subpoenaed documents are treated as presumptively privileged, this decision would only justify ordering their inspection in camera but not their nonproduction.&nbsp; However, as concession to the nature of the functions of the EIIB and just to be sure no information of a confidential character is disclosed, the examination of records in this case should be made in strict confidence by the Ombudsman himself. Reference may be made to the documents in any decision or order which the Ombudsman may render or issue but only to the extent that it will not reveal covert activities of the agency. Above all, there must be a scrupulous protection of the documents delivered.<br><br>With these safeguards outlined, it is believed that a satisfactory resolution of the conflicting claims of the parties is achieved.&nbsp; It is not amiss to state that even matters of national security have been inquired into in appropriate in camera proceedings by the courts. In <i>Lansang v. Garcia</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> this Court held closed door sessions, with only the immediate parties and their counsel present, to determine claims that because of subversion there was imminent danger to public safety warranting the suspension of the writ of <i>habeas corpus </i>in 1971.&nbsp; Again in <i>Marcos </i>v. <i>Manglapus</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> the Court met behind closed doors to receive military briefings on the threat posed to national security by the return to the country of the former President and his family.&nbsp; In the United States, a similar inquiry into the danger to national security as a result of the publication of classified documents on the Vietnam war was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> We see no reason why similar safeguards cannot be made to enable an agency of the Government, like the Office of the Ombudsman, to carry out its constitutional duty to protect public interests<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> while insuring the confidentiality of classified documents.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">C.</span><br></div><br>Petitioners contend that under Art. XI, § 13(4) the Ombudsman can act only "in any appropriate case, and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law" and that because the complaint in this case is unsigned and unverified, the case is not an appropriate one.&nbsp; This contention lacks merit.&nbsp; As already stated, the Constitution expressly enjoins the Ombudsman to act on any complaint filed "in any form or manner" concerning official acts or omissions.&nbsp; Thus, Art. XI, § 12 provides:<br><br>The Ombudsman and his Deputies, as protectors of the people, shall act promptly on complaint<span style="font-style: italic;">s filed in any form or manner</span> against public officials or employees of the Government, or any subdivision, agency, or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations and shall in appropriate cases, notify the complainants of the action taken and the result thereof.&nbsp; (Emphasis added)<br><br>Similarly, the Ombudsman Act of 1989 (Rep.

There has been no allegation of any irregularity in the COA's earlier examination, and in the absence of substantiated allegations, the previous determination ought to be accorded our respect unless we want to encourage unnecessary and tiresome forays and investigations into government activities which would not only end up nowhere but which would also disrupt or derail such activities.<br><br>The confidentiality privilege invoked by petitioners attaches in the exercise of the functions of the EIIB, as presidential immunity is bestowed by reason of the political functions of the Chief Executive, as a separate and co-equal branch of government.&nbsp; By the same parity of reasoning, the disclosure of the EIIB documents required to be examined by the Ombudsman even in <b>camera</b> proceedings will under the pretext of ascertaining the proper disbursements of the EIIB funds will unnecessarily impair the performance by the EIIB of its functions especially those affecting national security.<br><br>The constitutional right allowing disclosure of governmental documents, i.e., the right to information on matters of public concern is not absolute.&nbsp; While access to official records may not be prohibited, it may be regulated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Regulation includes appropriate authority to determine what documents are of public concern, the manner of access to information contained in such documents and to withhold information under certain circumstances, particularly, as in this case, those circumstances affecting the national security.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Besides, as I emphasized earlier, the determination of the legality of EIIB's disbursements of funds allocated to it are properly within the competence of the Commission on Audit, which as the ponencia of Justice Mendoza finds, has been cleared in audit. The Commission on Audit had adopted, as in the past, measures to protect "classified information" pertaining to examination of expenditures of intelligence agencies.&nbsp; In the present case, disclosure of information to <b>any other agency</b> would unnecessarily expose the covert operations of EIIB, as a government agency charged with national security functions.<br><br>I, therefore, <b>vote</b> to give due course to the petition.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> BERNAS, I THE CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, 265 (1987).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>See </i><i>id</i>., at 267.<br></div>
