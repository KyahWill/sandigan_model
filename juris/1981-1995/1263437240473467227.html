				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>This is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised
Rules of Court and Section 7, Art. IX (A)of the 1987 Constitution, to review,
reverse and set aside Resolutions Nos. 91-1091 and 92-202 of the Civil Service
Commission dated September 24, 1991 and January 30, 1992, respectively.</p>

<p class=BODY>Resolution No. 91-1091 found petitioner guilty of Grave
Misconduct and meted the penalty of dismissal, (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>,
pp. 27-30) while Resolution No. 92-202 denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration of the first resolution (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp.
31-34).</p>

<p class=BODY>The administrative case against petitioner was the off-shoot of a
letter of Antonia N. <span class=SpellE>Mirabona</span>, an employee of the
Department of Labor and Employment, which was published in the <st1:date
Month="8" Day="13" Year="1990">August 13, 1990</st1:date> issue of the
Philippine Daily Inquirer. The letter, which complained of cheating in the
August 5, 1990 Career Service Examination held at the J. <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span>
Elementary School in Manila, reads in part:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Civil Service Examination was held last Aug. 5, and I was
one of those who took the examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;The exam was going on smoothly until I witnessed an
irregularity. In the middle of the exam, a woman came to the room (Room 17,
Josephine Bldg. of J. <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span> Elementary School, <span
class=SpellE>Tayuman</span> and <span class=SpellE>Pingkian</span> Sts., <span
class=SpellE>Tondo</span>, <st1:City><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:City>).
She was in a black-striped dress. Maybe she is a member of the faculty since
the proctors who are teachers of the school, know her. She then got hold of a
questionnaire and started dictating the answers. Our proctor told us to keep it
a secret since we want you to pass.’”</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>As a consequence of the publication of the letter, the Civil
Service Commission - National Capital Region (CSC-NCR) conducted a fact-finding
investigation of the reported anomaly. In the investigation, petitioner was
identified as the woman referred to in the letter. The CSC-NCR formally charged
petitioner with Grave Misconduct for having dictated the answers to two or
three questions to an examinee on <st1:date Month="8" Day="5" Year="1990">August
 5, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class=BODY>After a hearing, the CSC-NCR submitted a Report of Investigation
to the Civil Service Commission finding petitioner guilty of a less grave
offense of Simple Misconduct and recommending the imposition of the penalty of
suspension for one month and one day to six months.</p>

<p class=BODY>Acting on the report of the CSC-NCR, the Civil Service Commission
held in its Resolution No. 91-1091 that the acts of petitioner constituted the
offense of Grave Misconduct and imposed the penalty of dismissal (<span
class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 27-30).</p>

<p class=BODY>The report of the CSC-NCR, which was adopted by the Civil Service
Commission, showed that petitioner was a public school teacher at the J. <span
class=SpellE>Rizal</span> Elementary School in <span class=SpellE>Tayuman</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Tondo</span>, <st1:City><st1:place><span class=GramE>Manila</span></st1:place></st1:City>.
On <st1:date Month="8" Day="5" Year="1990">August 5, 1990</st1:date>, she was a
proctor assigned to Room 20 of said school in the Career Service Examination.
While the examination was in progress, petitioner entered Room 17 and asked for
a glass of <span class=SpellE>softdrink</span> from <span class=SpellE>Digna</span>
Ventura, one of the proctors assigned to said room. When <st1:City><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:City>
went to get a drinking glass, petitioner got hold of a questionnaire and
dictated the answers to two or three items therein.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>After the letter of <span class=SpellE>Mirabona</span>
was published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Dr. Ester O. <span
class=SpellE>Sto</span>.</span> <span class=SpellE>Niño</span>, Principal of
the J. <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span> Elementary School, called petitioner to
her office. Petitioner admitted to Dr. <span class=SpellE>Sto</span>. <span
class=SpellE>Niño</span> that she was the person referred to in the letter.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner denied having dictated any of the answers to the
questions. According to her, she noticed that an examinee) with a perplexed
look on her. <span class=GramE>face</span>, kept turning her head from left to
right as if she was trying to get the proctors' attention. Inasmuch as the two
proctors assigned to Room 17 were busy, she approached the examinee and inquired
what was wrong. The examinee asked how an answer could be corrected or changed.
Petitioner then borrowed the examinee's questionnaire and calling the
examinees' attention, explained the procedure in changing their answers. She
testified:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I explained the directions <span class=SpellE>dahil</span>
may <span class=SpellE>nagtanong</span> - 'What am I supposed to do <span
class=GramE>kung</span> <span class=SpellE>halimbawa</span> <span class=SpellE>nagkamali</span>
<span class=SpellE>ako</span> and I want to change my answer.' I did not
discuss any (sic), <span class=SpellE>sabi</span> <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>ko</span></span> <span class=SpellE>halimbawa</span> 22 at <span
class=SpellE>sinasabi</span> <span class=SpellE>mong</span> <span class=SpellE>ang</span>
<span class=SpellE>sagot</span> mo 'b', <span class=SpellE>di</span> <span
class=SpellE>i</span>-blacken mo <span class=SpellE>ang</span> 'b' at <span
class=SpellE>burahin</span> mo <span class=SpellE>yong</span> 'a’. <span
class=SpellE>Kasi</span> <span class=SpellE>sabi</span> <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>ko</span></span>, kung computerized <span class=SpellE>ito</span>, <span
class=SpellE>iyon</span> <span class=SpellE>ang</span> <span class=SpellE>magrereflect</span>.
<st1:place><span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>lyon</span></span></st1:place> <span
class=SpellE>lang</span> ho <span class=SpellE>ang</span> <span class=SpellE>sinabi</span>
<span class=SpellE>ko</span>' I cited an example (TSN; January 28, 1991, p. 3; <span
class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 71).</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>We are inclined to believe petitioner's version rather than the
finding of the Civil Service Commission that petitioner dictated the answers to
two or three questions.</p>

<p class=BODY>Lourdes Gonzales, a proctor assigned to Room 17, could not say
whether what petitioner dictated were answers to questions in the examination.</p>

<p class=BODY>On cross-examination, she was asked: “You said you heard her
dictating, what <span class=GramE>was she</span> dictating?” Her answer: “I did
not exactly her (sic) what she said but she’s dictating something, may be
answers, I don’t know” (TSN, p. 6, January 28, 1991).</p>

<p class=BODY>Antonia N. <span class=SpellE>Mirabona</span>, the complainant
and <span class=SpellE>Digna</span> Ventura, the other proctor in Room 17, both
testified that petitioner dictated the answers to two or three questions. After
petitioner explained that what she dictated were not answers to specific
questions but hypothetical illustrations on how an examinee could correct a
previous answer, these two witnesses for the Civil Service Commission were not
recalled to rebut the claim of petitioner.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner claimed that she could not have given the answers to
the questions because she did not even know the correct answers. Credence can
be given to such a claim. As a mere grade school teacher, she is not accustomed
to supply the answers to the questions in a Career Service Examination. The
first level of this examination requires that the examinee has taken some
collegiate courses while the second level thereof requires the examinee to have
at least four years of collegiate studies. <span class=GramE>(Sec. 8, Title I,
Subtitle A, Book V, the Administrative Code of 1987).</span> The CSC-NCR
investigator reported that he could not confirm whether the answers dictated by
petitioner were correct (p. 3, CSC Res. No. 91-1091; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>,
p. 29).</p>

<p class=BODY>We should also consider that there were two sets of questions
(Form A and Form B) used in the examination. In such a case, for an answer to
be of any use, it was necessary that the specific question which it referred to
must first be read by petitioner. There was nothing on record to show that
petitioner first read the questions before giving the answers.</p>

<p class=BODY>In his comment on the petition, the Solicitor General stated that
&quot;[u]nder the circumstances [he] believes that petitioner is only guilty of
simple misconduct and should be meted the minimum penalty under the law of one
month and one day suspension&quot; (Rollo, pp. 123-124).</p>

<p class=BODY>The CSC-NCR is of the belief &quot;that what she has done could
not be so serious an act that would warrant grave misconduct and result in her
dismissal after long dedicated years of service in the &quot;government&quot;
(CSC-Resolution No. 91-1091, p. 3; <span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, p. 29).</p>

<p class=BODY>We agree with the Solicitor General and the CSC-NCR that
petitioner is guilty only of Simple Misconduct.</p>

<p class=BODY>From the evidence on record, we gather that petitioner did not
coach any particular examinee; rather, she addressed all the examinees in Room
17 when she explained the procedure for changing an answer. If she intended to
help a favored examinee, she should have just whispered the answers to the
questions.</p>

<p class=BODY>There is no evidence that petitioner profited <span class=SpellE>pecuniarily</span>
from the act imputed upon her.</p>

<p class=BODY>Except for the disturbance created by petitioner's officiousness,
the integrity of the examination cannot be said to have been compromised.</p>

<p class=BODY>In Grave Misconduct, as distinguished from Simple Misconduct, the
elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law or flagrant disregard
of established rule, must be manifest (In Re: Impeachment of <span
class=SpellE>Horrilleno</span>, 43 Phil. 212 [1922]). None of these elements
exists in petitioner's case.</p>

<p class=BODY>Finally, we take note of petitioner's 24 years of unblemished
service as a public school teacher.</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>WHEREFORE</b>, Resolutions
Nos. 91-1091 and 92-202 of the respondent Civil Service Commission are hereby
MODIFIED. Petitioner is found guilty only of SIMPLE MISCONDUCT and accordingly,
the Court imposes upon her the penalty of suspension of one month and one day.</p>
