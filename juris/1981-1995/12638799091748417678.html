<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution, and upon which the trial court
based its decision are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"According to the prosecution, on September 8, 1989, at around
7:30 o'clock in the evening, in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Toong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
the spouses Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> and Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>, together with their five (5) children, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rowena, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>,
Romeo, Marlon and Marissa, were all in their house thereat which is located
within the fishpond owned by Cherie <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, having
finished their supper, and Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> was taking a
rest while his wife and children were having fun, when suddenly they heard
knockings at their door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their son, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> Baize, then 19 years old, opened the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) persons <span style="">in </span>fatigue uniforms appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One was fair-complexioned and wearing slippers, while the
dark-complexioned one was wearing shoes - and without hats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fair complexioned one (who was later on
identified to be Herman Reception) poked a gun, a short one, at <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> then called
his father, Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>, that there were two (2)
persons who arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> approached them, and when the former came near the
door, the other one who was dark-complexioned (and later on identified to be
William Reception) poked his gun, also a short one, at Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all
herded inside the room by the brothers accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>William Reception put out the light and then asked Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> about a .45 caliber gun and a carbine which they
(William and Herman) were informed that the latter was keeping and who, in
turn, replied that he had none.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
accused then <span class="GramE">ransacked</span> the house and the <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding
nothing, the two accused took their money, wrist watch, the salinity (an
instrument used in prawn culture), bolo, and other items - with a total
estimated value of P11<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>William Reception then hit Mario Baize with
the gun on the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two accused then
took <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> and
telling that they would bring him to the Barracks because they were
Rangers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after a few minutes,
the household heard a gunshot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> and his wife, Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>,
ran to the place where the shot came from - which was around 100 meters away
from their house - and then and there saw their son, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>, lying on the ground full of blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sensed the two accused to be still
there, but were hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, a shot
was fired at them, hitting Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> on his right
arm and, likewise, hit Leticia Baize on the buttocks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the two accused, who were still
hiding and about one <span style="">(1) </span>meter
away from them, ordered them (spouses) to bring their son home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voices which the spouses heard resembled
those of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses
brought their son <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> home and then to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zapanta</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of San Jose, Occidental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, where he (<span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>) was
treated, but later on died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spouses,
Mario and Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>, were also treated in the
said hospital for which they spent P3<span class="GramE">,561.15</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "5").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Leticia <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> was, thereafter, brought to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for further treatment in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila, where she was confined and treated by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estrellado</span>, thereby spending another <span style="">sum </span>of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>."
(p. 20- 21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the appellants is summarized in
their brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the evening of <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1989</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>,
there was a birthday celebration for the daughter of Marilyn Reception at the <span style="">house </span>of Arturo Reyes, brother-in-law
of the Receptions at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Toong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="GramE">Occidental</span> <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The birthday celebration <span style="">was </span>attended to by Pablo Santiago and
Roman Santiago who conducted prayer meeting inside the house before the
birthday celebration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prayer meeting
was attended by the two accused and some others who were either <span class="GramE">relatives</span> of the Receptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two accused did not leave the house from the start of the prayer
meeting at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 p.m.</st1:time>, until the party
ended at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the celebration, the two
accused joined the singing fun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While
Roman Santiago was urinating outside the house, he heard gunshot coming from
the direction of the fishpond of the <span class="SpellE">Cuballa</span> but he
did not pay attention to it as it is very common happening at the said
fishpond.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The two accused slept ahead of Susan Reception during that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Susan Reception saw the two
accused already asleep when she finally went upstairs to sleep at the adjacent
room at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The distance of the house where the accused
were from the house of the <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> is about one (1)
kilometer.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning, the two accused woke up and fetched water for use by Susan
Reception who cooked very early so that her two brothers could eat first before
proceeding to the farm to weed the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> of Arturo
Reyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even after eating lunch, the two
accused slept inside the house for about two hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they again returned to the farm
and continued weeding and cleaning the rice paddies up to about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> when they finally went home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While at home and preparing themselves to
visit Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> whom they came to know was already
dead, some policemen, one of them identified as <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> and <span class="SpellE">CAFGUs</span> together
with Rodrigo Santiago arrived at their place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two accused were surprised and resented to the invitation but in
view of the promise of Rodrigo Santiago who is the Chairman in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Toong</span>, and only after about
twenty minutes of persuasion, the two accused went with the policemen to the
Police Station of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> against their will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Investigation was conducted by Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> on the persons of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two accused denied any knowledge and/or
participation on the robbery and the killing of Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="9">September
 9, 1989</st1:date>, Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> and Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> who were fetched from their house arrived at the
Police Station purposely to make identification of the two accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two accused were brought at the <span class="SpellE">messhall</span> of the PC Detachment which is adjacent to the
Police Station where bright light was put on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Cpl. Lucia <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> asked the boy Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> whether the two accused were the ones who entered
their house but the boy did not say anything even after Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> repeatedly asked him to identify the accused for a
period of about fifteen to twenty minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For failure of the boy to identify the two, the father, Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> who was present during the entire identification and
who even insisted his son to identify the two accused, told Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> to let the boy go home and the identification be
continued the following morning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, the two accused were put in jail without any
warrant of arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day,
the statements of Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> and Mario <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> were taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> accompanied by Cpl. Lucia <span class="SpellE">Fronda</span> inside the Jail where the accused were placed,
readily pointed to the two accused as the robbers, without any hesitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(T.S.N., March 21, 1990, pp. 1-14; T.S.N.,
March 27, 1990, pp. 1-12)" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 46-48)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellants raise a lone assignment of error, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING
ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF THE CRIMES OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE AND FRUSTRATED
HOMICIDE DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND
REASONABLE DOUBT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellants claim that the prosecution failed to establish the
identities of the culprits of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They cite the testimonies of the witnesses, specifically that of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>, the father of the victim, as full of untruthfulness
and inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">They stress the testimonies of both Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>
and Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> (younger brother of the deceased),
in that, both testified that they came to know the names of the appellants only
in court and not previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
argument seems to posit the view that the identities of the appellants were
only discovered during the court proceedings below.</p>

<p class="BODY">A further allegation is based on a particular testimony of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
claim that he gave inconsistent statements, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> claimed that he
recognized the two accused as the persons who entered their house on that
evening of <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1989</st1:date>
because he had known the two accused for five months already before <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1989</st1:date>, aside from the fact
that there was a time when even met the accused on the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when pressed further during
cross-examinations, he admitted that there was no occasion that he ever saw or
met either of the two accused before <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1989</st1:date>." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 49)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are not convinced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled principle in law that discrepancies in minor
details do not impair the credibility of the testimony of a witness.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Resayaga</span>,
54 SCRA 350 [1973]; People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 89407, December 21, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of a prolonged direct examination, more so, during
cross-examination, the witness is usually subjected to unfriendly
questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, it is usually
the case that the witness, uncomfortable and fidgety in a courtroom scene, may
often fall into lapses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
infrequent for a witness to make minor mistakes in his narration of facts; the
intimidating presence of the opposing counsel coupled by the verbose and
misleading manner of questioning are factors determinant of these
inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testimony, on the other hand, which is presented in a
strait-laced <span class="GramE">fashion</span> deserves little credence or none
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imperfect memory of man
belies testimony presented with utmost accuracy even as to the minutest of
details.</p>

<p class="BODY">The technique in deciphering testimony is not to solely
concentrate on isolated parts of that testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correct meaning of the testimony can
often be ascertained only upon a perusal of the entire testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, everything stated by the
witness has to be considered in relation to what else has been stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants emphatically refer to this Court the particular
testimony of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> that there was no occasion
before the date of the commission of the crime that he met the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this ground, they seek a reversal of the
judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have previously mentioned that witnesses sometimes get
confused and rattled during an adversarial and protracted
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the
records shows that we can attribute the reasons for the alleged inconsistencies
in the testimony of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> to this factor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other parts of the testimony of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>,
he categorically declared that he is familiar with the faces of the appellants
because previous to the commission of the crime he has "met <span class="GramE">them</span> (appellants) along the way." (TSN, March 8, 1990,
Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>, p. 23)</p>

<p class="BODY">This particular declaration was thereafter, reiterated by Mario
when Judge <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>
himself asked <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> questions regarding
certain points of his testimony, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How come that you
were able to see them on the way?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because I used to walk along the street
passing by and once in a while I saw them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And these (2) persons that you saw and met
on the way, are the two (2) persons who are now here in Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, <span class="GramE">Your</span> Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why did you say so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because when they entered our house, Your
Honor, I already recognized their faces." (TSN, Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>,
March 8, 1990, p. 38)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> does not sound
improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opportunity for him to
meet the appellants, on the streets of the municipality <span style="">is </span>not far-fetched for they are actually part of the same
neighborhood within the municipality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The distance<span style=""> </span>between their
respective houses is only 500 meters.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Familiarity with each others faces in this provincial town is not very
unlikely.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' <span class="GramE">claim that the witnesses were
not aware of the names of the appellants, and only when the case was heard by
the court a quo did the witnesses come</span> to know of their names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the appellants' view that the
identities of the malefactors of a crime can be established only if the
witnesses know the names of the malefactors.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is puerile reasoning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Identification of a person is not established solely through knowledge
of the name of that person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Familiarity
with the physical features, particularly those of the face, is actually the
best way to identify the person.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe Mario <span class="SpellE">Baeza's</span> statement that
<span style="">he </span>actually recognized the
appellants as the culprits of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His familiarity with the faces of the <span class="GramE">appellants</span>
gains credence if we consider that they are almost neighbors and only 500
meters separate their respective houses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It matters not if Mario <span class="SpellE">B<span style="">aeza</span></span><span style=""> </span>did
not know their names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the natural
course of things, it is sometimes possible for one not to ask a neighbor his
name, when he meets him on the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They may merely nod or smile at each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One may be familiar with the face but not
necessarily the name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not follow
therefore, that to <span class="GramE">he</span> able to identify a person, one
must first know his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">The identities of the appellants were corroborated by Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>, the 9 year old brother of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> declared
that he recognized the appellants as the same persons who stormed into their
house, robbed them, and killed his brother, for the reason that at one time
before the commission of the crime, he had met the appellants when his brother,
Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> visited the appellants' sister in their
house, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said that there are two persons who entered your <span class="GramE">house,</span>
did you recognize these two persons who knocked at your door?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
did you recognize them?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
recognized them because there was <span style="">a </span>time
that I visited their house." (TSN, Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>,
March 9, 1990, pp. 5-6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of a boy, 9 years of age, deserves utmost
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Bustos</u></span> (45 Phil. 9 [1923]), we declared:</p>

<blockquote>"An intelligent boy is undoubtedly the best observer to be
found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The world begins to take him by
storm with its thousand matters of interests; xxx he has already got some
principles; lying is distasteful to him, because he thinks it mean; he is no
stranger to the sentiment of self-respect, and he never loses an opportunity of
being right in what he affirms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus he
is, as a rule, but little influenced by the suggestions of others, and he
describes objects and occurrences as he has really seen them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We say again that an intelligent boy is as a
rule the best witness in the world.' <span class="GramE">(As quoted from Moore on
Facts, vol. II, p. 1055, 1056)."</span> (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp.
35-36)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants point to the fact that Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>
failed to identify the appellants outright when they were first presented to
him for identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This argument is
unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants were
presented before Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> for identification on
the night immediately following the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be doubted that there was still
much fear felt by Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tragic incident when he witnessed the
robbery committed right in <span class="GramE">their own</span> house and the
killing of his brother was still too fresh for Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fear of meeting face to face, after the
lapse of only one day after the commission of the crime, had its effect on
Marlon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only but natural for a boy
of nine years to be silent about identifying the culprits of the crime under
the circumstances considering that he was expected to identify them while they
were face to face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the claim of
the appellants in this regard unconvincing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, there is no cogent reason why we should not sustain
the trial court in its appraisal of the testimonies of Mario and Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants
have not shown why the witnesses for the prosecution should falsely charge
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No iota of evidence has been presented
which suggests any evil motive on the part of the witnesses to implicate the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither has it been made to
appear that there was an existing animosity between the appellants and the
witnesses sufficient to serve as a moving force for the latter to implicate the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason therefore
for the witnesses to incriminate the appellants other than to tell the truth as
they have seen it.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the settled rule must be sustained in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court will not generally
disturb the findings of the trial court, for the latter is in a better position
to decide the case, having observed the demeanor of the witnesses while
testifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And absent any showing that
a matter of substance was arbitrarily disregarded, the rule must be
upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Elizaga</span>,
73 SCRA 524 [1976]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Deslate</span>, G.R. No.
87807, December 21, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' alibi, that they could not have been at the scene
of the crime since they were celebrating the birthday of their niece, was rejected
by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We see no sound
reason not to sustain the court's findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants allege that the failure of the prosecution
witnesses to fully establish the identities of the malefactors of the <span class="GramE">crime,</span> makes their defense of alibi worthy of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they added, it is an exception to
the prevailing rule that alibi is the weakest defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses, as earlier stated, were able to
positively identify the appellants as the same persons who robbed them and
killed Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their identities were fully established by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as a matter of law, positive
identification prevails over the plea of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>, 52 SCRA 259 [1973];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span>, G.R. Nos. 63753-54, December 21,
1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in the absence of any motive on the part of the
witnesses to falsely incriminate the appellants, the rule has been, to
discredit the plea of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Acanto</span>, 109 Phil. 993 [1960]) The records are bereft of any
evidence which shows that the witnesses harbored any ill-feelings or hatred
against the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
acquaintances, nothing more and less.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that Mario and Marlon <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span> are the
father and the brother of the deceased, respectively, standing alone, will not
be sufficient to discredit their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being related to the deceased by consanguinity does not ipso facto, make
them biased witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
clearly shown that, independent of the relationship, the testimony is
inherently improbable in itself or <span style="">that
</span>there are properly charged improper motives of the witnesses to
incriminate the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, 73 SCRA 583 [1976]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Cuadra</span>,
85 SCRA 576 [1978]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pajenado</span>, 69 SCRA 172
[1976]) We find, however, neither circumstance present in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the appellants had the
motive to kill Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>, for the reason that the
latter was the sweetheart of the appellant's sister but he broke their
relationship in order to court Merle Feliciano who in turn was being courted by
Herman Reception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, we need not
dwell into this circumstance, the identities of culprits having been
established, the need to discuss the motive for the killing has become
unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the defense of the appellants to prosper, it must be shown
that not only were they present at some other place, but also that it was
physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time of
the commission of the felony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v.
<span class="SpellE">Palamos</span>, 49 Phil. 601[1926]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Liera</span>, 82 SCRA 163 [1978]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Manago</span>,
G.R. No. 90669, November 21, 1990)</p>

<p class="BODY">The distance between the house of the <span class="SpellE">Baezas</span>,
where the felony was committed, and the house of the appellants negates their
defense of alibi. The distance between their respective houses is only 500
meters; the physical impossibility of the appellants to be at the scene of the
crime does not hold true in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They could reach the <span class="SpellE">Baeza's</span> residence after
only a few minutes walk.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the appellants were, at the time of the commission of the
felony, attending a party would still not negate the fact that they were able
to perpetrate the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have
easily slipped out and proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Baeza</span>
residence and thereafter immediately return to the birthday party of their
niece without any of the guests noticing their departure, assuming the alibi is
true.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover in any celebration, particularly that of a birthday
party, there is much revelry, singing, and eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attention of those people who are present
in the celebration is not particularly focused on a particular guest but on the
revelry itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of the
witnesses for the appellants which declared that they were able to see the
appellants attend the party and in fact see them singing throughout its
duration appear dubious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the
alibi thus played up by the appellants and which the witnesses tried to confirm
contrary to common experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the lower court correctly found the
appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Robbery with
Homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in view of the prevailing jurisprudence, the indemnity
for the death of Eddie <span class="SpellE">Baiza</span> is raised from P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification set forth above.</p>
