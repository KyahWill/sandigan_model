				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">We are asked to reverse a decision of the Court of Appeals
sustaining the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City over a complaint filed by a buyer, the herein private respondent, against
the petitioner, for delivery of title to a subdivision lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The position of the petitioner, the defendant
in that action, is that the decision of the trial court is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> because
the case should have been heard and decided by what is now called the Housing
and Land Use Regulatory Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1982</st1:date>, by <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Payawal</span> against Solid Homes, Inc. before the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-36119.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
plaintiff alleged that the defendant contracted to sell to her a subdivision
lot in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1975</st1:date>, for the
agreed price of P28<span class="GramE">,080.00</span>, and that by <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1981</st1:date>, she had already
paid the defendant the total amount of P38,949.87 in monthly installments and
interests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Solid Homes subsequently
executed a deed of sale over the land but failed to deliver the corresponding
certificate of title despite her repeated demands because, as it appeared
later, the defendant had mortgaged the property in bad faith to a financing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The plaintiff asked for delivery of the title to the lot </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">alternatively, the return of </span>all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the amounts </span>paid by her plus interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also claimed moral and exemplary damages,
attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Solid Homes moved to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that the court had </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">jurisdiction, this being vested in the
National Housing Authority under PD No. 957.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The motion was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defendant <span class="SpellE">repleaded</span> the objection in its answer,
citing Section 3 of the said decree providing that "the National Housing
Authority shall have exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the real estate </span>trade
and business in accordance with the provisions of this Decree." After
trial, judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff and the defendant was
ordered to deliver to her the title to the land or, failing this, to refund to
her the sum of P38<span class="GramE">,949.87</span> plus interest from 1975 and
until the full amount was paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
also awarded P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">moral damages, </span>P5,000.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">exemplary

obvious efforts to evade a legitimate obligation, including its dilatory
tactics during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
was also reproved for its "gall" in collecting the further amount of
P1<span class="GramE">,238.47</span> from the plaintiff purportedly for realty
taxes and registration expenses despite its inability to deliver the title to
the land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In holding that the trial
court had jurisdiction, the respondent court referred to Section 41 of P</span>D
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">No. 957 itself providing that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 41.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

rights and remedies provided in this Decree shall be in addition to any and all
other rights and remedies that may be available under existing laws.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">and</span> declared
that "its clear and unambiguous tenor undermine (d) the (petitioner's)
pretension that the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> was bereft of jurisdiction."
The decision also dismissed the contrary opinion of the Secretary of Justice as
impinging on the authority of the courts of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we are disturbed by the findings of fact of the trial court
and the respondent court on the dubious conduct of the petitioner, we
nevertheless must sustain it on the jurisdictional issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicable law is PD No. 957, as amended by PD No. 1344,
entitled "Empowering the National Housing Authority to Issue Writs of
Execution in the Enforcement of Its Decisions <span class="GramE">Under</span>
Presidential Decree No. 957." Section 1 of the latter decree provides as
follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">SECTION </span>1.</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>In the exercise of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

for in Presidential Decree No. 957, the National Housing Authority shall have <u>exclusive
jurisdiction</u> to hear and decide cases of the following nature:</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Unsound real estate
business practices</u>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Claims </span><u>involving refund and any other claims</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filed by subdivision lot or condominium unit
buyer against the project owner, developer, dealer, broker or salesman; and</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cases </span><u>involving specific

condominium unit against the owner, developer, dealer, broker or salesman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The language of this section, especially the underscored
portions, leaves no room for doubt that "exclusive jurisdiction" over
the case between the petitioner and the private respondent is vested not in the
Regional Trial Court but in the National Housing Authority.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent contends that the applicable law is BP No.
129, which confers on regional trial courts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">jurisdiction to hear and decide cases mentioned in its Section 19,
reading in part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 19.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Municipal Circuit Trial Courts;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(8)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all other cases in
which the demand, exclusive of interest and cost or the value of the property
in controversy, amounts to more than twenty thousand pesos (P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It stresses, additionally, that BP No. 129 should control as the
later enactment, having been promulgated in 1981, after PD No. 957 was issued
in 1975 and PD No. 1344 in 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">This construction must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">yield
</span>to the familiar canon that in case of conflict between a general law and
a special law, the latter must prevail regardless of the dates of their
enactment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">The fact that one law is special and the other
general creates <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>presumption

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The circumstance that the
special law is passed before or after the general act does not change the
principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the special law is
later, it will be regarded as an exception to, or a qualification of, the prior
general act; and where the general act is <span class="GramE">later,</span> the
special statute will be construed </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

necessary implication.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that the general law in this case is BP No. 129 and
PD No. 1344 the special law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that the trial court could also assume jurisdiction
because of Section 41 of PD No. 957, earlier quoted, is also unacceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not read that provision as vesting
concurrent jurisdiction on the Regional Trial Court and the Board over the
complaint mentioned in PD No. 1344 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt">if </span>only
because grants of power are not to be lightly inferred or merely implied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only purpose of this section, as we see
it, is to reserve to the aggrieved party such other remedies as may be provided
by existing law, like <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>prosecution
for the act complained of under the Revised Penal Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On the competence of the Board to award damages, we find that
this is part of the exclusive power conferred upon it by PD No. 1344 to hear
and decide "claims involving refund and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">any other claims</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>filed
by subdivision lot or condominium unit buyers against the project owner,
developer, dealer, broker or salesman." It was therefore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">erroneous for the respondent to brush aside
the well-taken opinion of the Secretary of Justice that ?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Such claim for damages which the subdivision/condominium buyer may
have against the owner, developer, dealer or salesman, being a necessary
consequence of an adjudication of liability for non-performance of contractual
or statutory obligation, may be deemed necessarily included in the phrase
"claims involving refund and any other claims" used in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> subparagraph C of Section 1 of PD No.
1344.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The phrase "any other
claims" is, we believe, sufficiently broad to include any and all claims
which are incidental to or a necessary consequence of the claims/cases
specifically included in the grant of jurisdiction to the National Housing
Authority under the subject provisions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The same may be said with respect to claims for attorney's fees
which are recoverable either by agreement of the parties or pursuant to Art.
2208 of the Civil Code (1) when exemplary damages are awarded and (2) where the
defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the
plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>Besides, <u>a strict construction of the subject provisions of PD
No. 1344 which would deny the HSRC the authority to adjudicate claims for
damages and for damages and for attorney's fees would result in multiplicity of
suits in that the subdivision/condominium buyer who wins a case in the HSRC and
who is thereby deemed entitled to claim damages and attorney's fees, would be
forced to litigate in the regular courts for the purpose, a situation which is
obviously not in the contemplation of the law</u>. (Emphasis supplied.)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
