				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the February
27, 1990 decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. CV No. 10603 entitled "PACIFIC COAST TIMBER PRODUCTS, INC. vs.
LUCIO TAN ALIM", affirming the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch LXXXIX in
Civil Case No. Q-24970 which dismissed private respondent's complaint, but
allowed the petitioner to exercise his option to buy the tractor in question,
which decision was later amended <span style="">in </span>its
Order, dated September 19, 1985, partially granting petitioner's motion for
reconsideration but denying his plea therein to grant damages for unrealized
income in his logging business due to <span style="">the
</span>alleged irregular and illegal seizure of the said equipment leased to
him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case arose out of <span style="">a </span>Lease
Contract with Option To Buy, dated January 5, 1977, which was entered into by
and between respondent PACIFIC COAST TIMBER PRODUCTS, INC., as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and petitioner LUCIO TAN ALIM, as lessee, for a
term of fifteen months over a unit of tractor at a monthly rental of P10,000.00
subject to the stipulation, among others, that after payment of five months,
the lessee is given an option to purchase the equipment at the price of
P150,000.00, in which event the rental paid shall be considered as part payment
of the consideration and that the subject equipment has to remain at the
lessee's jobsite at PARCEL III-R, between <span class="SpellE">Dianawan</span>
Creek and <span class="SpellE">Bazal</span>, San Joaquin, Baler (Original Record,
p. 7; Exhibit "1" and Exhibit "A").</p>

<p class="BODY">However, upon its delivery on January 15, 1977, the tractor was
discovered to be defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> informed the private respondent's
manager at <span style="">San Luis, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> of such fact in his letter, dated January 25, </span>1977,
relaying likewise the need for the tractor's reconditioning or replacement with
another unit <span style="">in </span>good running condition
and the immediate repair thereof as may be arranged by him with the Manila
Office (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 96, Exhibit "2").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Logging Manager of the respondent
corporation, Luis O. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, issued a certification
on June 11, 1977 that a defective tractor was delivered to the petitioner (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 98, Exhibit "5").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amount of P5,000.00 for the repair of the tractor was then paid by the private
respondent to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> on January 29, 1977 (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 97, Exhibit "4").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> expended the amount of
P36,130.60 for its repair and reconditioning, as specifically contained in his
letter to respondent corporation of June 25, 1977 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 99, Exhibit
"3").</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1977, the parties amended the lease contract with
petitioner's obligation to execute a Deed <span style="">of
</span>Chattel Mortgage for his three motor vehicles in favor of the respondent
to guarantee his undertaking in the amended lease contract (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
101-102; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 12-13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent corporation's counsel, <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>, formally informed
<span class="SpellE">Alim</span> in a letter dated March 16, 1978 that under the
amended contract wherein payment of rentals commenced in August, 1977, the
latter failed to pay rentals <span style="">for seven </span>months,
from September, 1977 <span style="">to February, </span>1978
in the amount of P70,000.00, for which reason the contract of lease as well as
the option to buy, are automatically terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same counsel likewise sent <span style="">a </span>notice of default in obligation
secured by the Chattel Mortgage (<u>Ibid</u>., Exhibit "C"; p. 11,
Exhibit "D"; Original Records, p. 12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the petition for extrajudicial
foreclosure thereon was returned by the sheriff unsatisfied (<u>Ibid</u>., p.
12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, a complaint for
recovery of possession with <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> (of a unit of
tractor) (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 13-15-A; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
15-18), was filed by private respondent before the then Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City due to petitioner's refusal to pay the
arrears and to deliver the subject equipment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the <span style="">filing </span>of
a bond by Pacific Coast Timber Products, Inc., furnished by Pioneer Insurance
and Surety Corporation in the sum of P300,000.00 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 26), the
trial court issued <span style="">a </span>writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> for the seizure and delivery of the property in
question on April 13, 1978 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 36; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 16, 1978, Deputy
Sheriff Reynaldo P. Lopez of the then Court of First Instance of Aurora
Sub-province at Baler, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, seized the tractor
from the petitioner and turned it over to the respondent corporation on April
26, 1978 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 45, Sheriff's Return of Service).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 38-43), the petitioner denied
having defaulted in the payment of rentals and claimed to have sustained
damages for unrealized income in <span style="">his
logging </span>business as a result of the wrongful seizure of the tractor (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 21).</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties having failed to reach an agreement at the
pre-trial, the case was tried on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the order of the trial court dated December 17, 1980,
respondent corporation's motion to recall or lift the Order of Seizure and to
cancel the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond the same having already served
their purposes, (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 142-143), which was opposed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 144-146), was denied for lack of
merit since the case was still pending in court (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 149).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the scheduled hearing of July 14, 1981, both parties failed to
attend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the dismissal of the case
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. <span style="">158).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the order of dismissal was
reconsidered upon explanation of the parties (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 159).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was finally resolved in </span>favor
of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> on July 31, 1985 by the trial
court (RTC, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City), the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
plaintiff's complaint, and allowing the defendant within fifteen days from and
after this judgment becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, to
exercise his option under the Lease Contract with Option to Buy, as amended, to
buy the tractor, in question, by paying to the plaintiff the balance of
P90,000.00 after deducting from the purchase price of P150,000.00, in rentals,
already paid by him, and ordering the plaintiff to pay to the defendant the
amount of P36,130.60 as reimbursement for the expenses for repairs made by the
defendant on the tractor which may be <span class="SpellE">offsetted</span> from
the remaining purchase price of P90,000.00 if the defendant exercises his
option to buy, plus reasonable attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00, with
costs against the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 32-33)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The said decision was, however, partially modified upon motion
for reconsideration of the petitioner, dated August 19, 1985 (Original Record,
pp. 259-261), in its Order dated September 19, 1985, in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
plaintiff's complaint, and allowing the defendant, within fifteen (15) days
from and after (sic) this judgment becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
to exercise his option under the Lease Contract with Option To Buy, as amended,
to buy the tractor, in question by paying to the plaintiff the balance of
P80,000.00 after deducting from the purchase price of P150,000.00, the amount
of P70,000.00 in rentals, already paid by him, and ordering the plaintiff to
pay to the defendant the amount of P36,130.60 as reimbursement for the expenses
for repairs made by the defendant on the tractor, which may be <span class="SpellE">offsetted</span> (sic) from the remaining purchase price of
P80,000.00, if the defendant exercises his option to buy, plus reasonable
attorney's fees in the amount of P5,000.00, with costs against the
plaintiff." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 37-A-38).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the modified decision, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> appealed, claiming damages because <span style="">of </span>the wrongful seizure of the
tractor, but the same was affirmed by the Court of Appeals which denied said
petitioner's claim for compensation and concurred with the following findings
of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"However, since the fifteen (15) month lease period provided
in the contract had already expired x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the plaintiff may not be judicially compelled to deliver
the tractor to defendant since after the expiration of the lease period, it is
legally entitled to its possession, as the owner thereof." <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>p.
62)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied by the Court
of Appeals in its resolution dated April 30, 1990 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 65).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this case are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the fifteen (15) month
lease period had commenced from August 1977 and expired in October 1978; (2)
whether or not the petitioner is entitled to collect/recover damages as prayed
for in the complaint; and (3) whether or not petitioner is entitled to recover
the sum of P300,000.00 from the <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond, all of
which may be synthesized in one pivotal issue, the interpretation of the
"Amendment to Contract of Lease" (Exhibit "6", Original
Records, p. 9) in relation to the “Original Lease Contract with Option to Buy (Exhibit
"1". Original Records, p. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals are of the view
that there is no amendment as to the duration of the Contract of Lease; that
the contract expired as originally stipulated on April 5, 1978 and that when the
tractor was seized by virtue of a writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> on
August 16, 1978, the contract of lease had expired and the lessee <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> was consequently not entitled to damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful review of the records shows that in the original
contract, it was expressly stipulated that the lease shall be for a period of
fifteen (15) months (Exhibit "1". par. 2) and that the lessee is
given an option to purchase the equipment for ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND
(P150,000.00) PESOS, after <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> has completed and
religiously paid the 5-month rentals which shall be considered as part payment
of the consideration (<u>Ibid</u>., par. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is no provision in the amended contract
as to the period of the lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
it provides that "All provisions of the original lease contract not
amended by the foregoing provisions shall remain in full force and
effect." (Exhibit "6", par. 5).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The alteration is evidently focused on the period for the right to
exercise the option to buy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally,
the period was five (5) months of regular payment but under the amended
contract, the period was changed to fifteen (15) months, unquestionably
including the period from the commencement of the original contract on January
7, 1977, as specifically provided in paragraph 4 thereof, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The monthly rentals of the equipment which on
the date of the execution of this amendment to the original lease contract have
not been paid shall be considered as paid obligation of LESSEE to <span style="">LESSOR, </span>the payment of which will be
the subject of negotiation between LESSOR and LESSEE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The letter of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>, counsel of respondent corporation, on which <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> heavily relied in his arguments in his favor,
unmistakably confirms the fact of non-extension of the lease agreement when he
spoke of the commencement of the payment of the rentals, not on the
commencement of the new period of lease (Exhibit "C", Original
Records, p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inevitably, the courts
cannot go beyond what appears in the documents submitted by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing is more settled than the rule that the terms of a written
contract are binding on the parties thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the interpretation of the provisions of a written contract, the
courts should follow the literal meaning of the stipulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the evident intention of the
parties must prevail (Art. 1370, Civil Code) (Spouses Roberto E. <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maylinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferraren</span> v. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. 95146, May
6, 1991).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There it therefore no
merit in the petitioner's allegation that the seizure was wrongful for which he
must be compensated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ownership or
right of possession over the subject equipment belonged to the Pacific Coast
Timber Products, Inc. at the time it was </span>seized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The seizure of the equipment was ordered by
the trial court for its restoration by means established in the laws of
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the requisites for the
issuance of the writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> (Sec. 2, Rule 60)
have been satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ is a provisional remedy in <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in the "nature of a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action and the applicant who seeks the immediate
possession of the property need not be the holder of the legal title to the
property." It is sufficient that at the time he applied for a writ of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> he is found to be "entitled to a possession
thereof" as stated in Section 2, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court (Yang v.
Valdez, 177 SCRA 141 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court correctly observed that the trial court was
right in holding that "the plaintiff may not anymore be judicially
compelled to deliver the tractor to the defendant since after the expiration of
the lease period, it is legally entitled to its possession, as the owner
thereof (p. 5, RTC decision; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
31)".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is very clear therefore,
that <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> is not entitled to any award of damages
based on the foregoing facts and evidence presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can he claim moral and exemplary
damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that the
petitioner was not able to adduce any evidence before the trial court to prove
facts upon which the award for such damages may be predicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, even in the petition and memorandum
for the petitioner, there was no discussion of the evidence upon which <span class="SpellE">Alim</span> relies for his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moral damages have to do with injury personal to the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> such as physical sufferings and the like, while
exemplary damages are imposed by way of example or correction for the public
good (<span class="SpellE">Makabili</span> v. Court of Appeals, 157 SCRA 253
[1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Indisputably, moral damages cannot generally be awarded in the
absence of bad faith (De <span class="SpellE">Aparico</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Paraguya</span>, 150 SCRA 279 [1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, moral damages can be
awarded if they are the proximate results of a wrongful act or omission (<span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> Credit Corporation v. Mendez, 152 SCRA 593
[1987]), while exemplary damages are not awarded if the defendant had not acted
in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner (Zenith Insurance Corporation v.
Court of Appeals, 185 SCRA 398 [1990]), neither can claim for exemplary damages
be granted in the absence of gross or reckless negligence (Delos Santos, et al.
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. 51165, June 21, 1990), which misfeasance is not true
in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">A <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> bond is simply intended to
indemnify the defendant against any loss that he may suffer by being compelled
to surrender the possession of the disputed property pending the trial of the
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot <span style="">recover on </span>the bond as for a <span class="SpellE">reconversion</span> when he has failed to have the judgment
entered for the return of the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is the surety liable for payment of the judgment for damages
rendered against the plaintiff on a counterclaim or punitive damages for
fraudulent or wrongful acts committed by the plaintiffs and unconnected with
the defendant's deprivation of possession by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even where the judgment was that the
defendant was entitled to the property, but no order was made requiring the
plaintiff to return it or assessing damages in default of a return, it was
declared that until judgment was entered that the property should be restored,
there could be no liability on the part of the sureties (<span class="SpellE">Sapugay</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 183 SCRA 464 [1990]).</p>
