thru mistake on her part or fraud on the part of <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span>
she was induced to sign as co-maker <span style="">of

personal obligation with the bank by reason of a deposit of P3,383.00 with the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue raised in the
first three (3) assignment of errors is whether or not respondent court
correctly affirmed the lower court in declaring the promissory note (Exhibit 2)
invalid insofar as they affect respondent Castro <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
petitioner bank, and the mortgage contract (Exhibit 6) valid up to the amount
of P3,000.00 only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent court declared
that the consent of Castro to the promissory note (Exhibit 2) where she signed
as co-maker with the <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span> as principal borrowers
and her acquiescence to the mortgage contract (Exhibit 6) where she encumbered
her property to secure the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was
obtained by fraud perpetrated on her by the <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span>
who had abused her confidence, taking advantage of her old age and ignorance of
her financial need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court
added that "the mandate of fair play decrees that she should be relieved
of her obligation under the contract" pursuant to Articles 24</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and 1332</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> of the Civil Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision in effect relieved Castro of any liability to the
promissory note (Exhibit 2) and the mortgage contract (Exhibit 6) was deemed
valid up to the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> only which was
equivalent to her personal loan to the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argued that since the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> were solely
declared in the decision to be responsible for the fraud against Castro, in the
light of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alios</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>acta</u></span> rule, a
finding of fraud perpetrated by the spouses against Castro cannot be taken to
operate prejudicially against the bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners concluded that respondent court erred in not giving effect
to the promissory note (Exhibit 2) insofar as they affect Castro and the bank
and in declaring that the mortgage contract (Exhibit 6) was valid only to the
extent of Castro's personal loan of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case reveal that respondent court's <span class="GramE">findings of fraud against the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Valencias</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"> is</span> well supported by evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="GramE">findings of
fact by respondent court in the matter is</span> deemed final.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision declared the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
solely responsible for the <span class="SpellE">defraudation</span> of
Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners' contention that the
decision was silent regarding the participation of the bank in the fraud is,
therefore, correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree with the contention of petitioners that the bank
was defrauded by the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, no claim was made on this in the
lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, petitioners
did not submit proof to support its contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, <span class="GramE">We</span> observe that while the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> defrauded
Castro by making her sign the promissory note (Exhibit 2) and the mortgage
contract (Exhibit 6), they also misrepresented to the bank Castro's personal
qualifications in order to secure its consent to the loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This must be the reason which prompted the
bank to contend that it was defrauded by the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to reiterate, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot agree with the contention for reasons above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, if the contention deserves any
consideration at all, it is in indicating the admission of petitioners that the
bank committed mistake in giving its consent to the contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, as a result of the fraud upon Castro and the misrepresentation
to the bank inflicted by the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>,
both Castro and the bank committed mistake in giving their consents to the
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, substantial
mistake vitiated their consents given.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For if Castro had been aware of what she signed and the bank of the true
qualifications of the loan applicants, it is evident that they would not have
given their consents to the contracts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to Article 1342
of the Civil Code which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1342<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Misrepresentation</span> by a third person does not vitiate consent,
unless such misrepresentation has created substantial mistake and the same is
mutual."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We cannot declare the promissory note
(Exhibit 2) valid between the bank and Castro and the mortgage contract
(Exhibit 6) binding on Castro beyond the amount of P3,000.00, for while the
contracts may not be invalidated insofar as they affect the bank and Castro on
the ground of fraud because the bank was not a participant thereto, such may
however be invalidated on the ground of substantial mistake mutually committed
by them as a consequence of the fraud and misrepresentation inflicted by the <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in
the case of Hill vs. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court declared that a contract may be annulled on the ground of vitiated
consent if deceit by a third person, even without connivance or complicity with
one of the contracting parties, resulted in mutual error on the part of the
parties to the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argued that the amended complaint fails to contain
even a general averment of fraud <span style="">or </span>mistake,
and its mention in the prayer is definitely not a substantial compliance with the
requirement of Section 5, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case, however, will show
that the amended complaint contained a particular averment of fraud against the
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
in full compliance with the provision of the Rules of Court. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Although, the amended complaint made no
mention of mistake being incurred in by the bank and Castro, such mention is
not essential in order that the promissory note (Exhibit 2) may be declared of
no binding effect between them and the mortgage (Exhibit 6) valid up to the
amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the mistake they mutually
suffered was a mere consequence of the fraud perpetrated by the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> against
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the fraud particularly
averred in the complaint, having been proven, is deemed sufficient basis for
the declaration of the promissory note (Exhibit 2) invalid insofar as it
affects Castro <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the bank, and the mortgage
contract (Exhibit 6) valid only up to the amount of P3,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue raised in the fourth assignment of errors is who
between Castro and the bank should suffer the consequences of the fraud
perpetrated by the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In attributing to Castro all consequences of the loss, petitioners
argue that it was her negligence or acquiescence if not her actual connivance
that made the fraud possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' argument utterly disregards the findings of respondent
Court of Appeals wherein petitioners' negligence in the contracts has been
aptly demonstrated, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"A witness for the defendant bank, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span>
claims he had subjected the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to
several interviews.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were true <span style="">why is it that her age was placed at 61
instead of 70; why was she described in the application (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span> B-1-9) as drug
manufacturer when in fact she was not; why was it placed in the application
that she has an income of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> when according to
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, she has not even given such kind
of information - the true fact being that she was being paid P1.20 per <span class="SpellE">picul</span> of the sugarcane production in her hacienda and 500 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> on the <span class="SpellE">palay</span>
production."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the foregoing, it is
evident that the bank was as <span class="GramE">much guilty</span>, as Castro
was, of negligence in giving its consent </span>to the contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It apparently relied on representations made
by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
spouses when it should have directly obtained the needed data from Castro who
was the acknowledged owner of the <span style="">property
offered as collateral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
considering Castro's </span>personal circumstances - her lack of education,
ignorance and old age - she cannot be considered utterly neglectful for having
been defrauded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is demanded
of petitioners to exercise the highest order of care and prudence in its
business dealings with the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
considering that it is engaged in a banking busi<span style="">ness - a business affected with public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should have ascertained Castro's awareness
of what she was signing or made her understand what obligations she was
assuming, considering that she was giving accommodation to, without any
consideration from, the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Valencia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> spouses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further argue that Castro's act of holding the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> as her agent
led the bank to believe that they were authorized to speak and bind her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She cannot now be permitted to deny the
authority of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
to act as her agent for one who clothes another with apparent authority as her
agent is not permitted to deny such authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority of the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> was only to
follow-up Castro's loan application with the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not authorized to borrow for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is apparent from the fact that Castro
went to the Bank to sign the promissory note for her loan of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If her act
had been understood by the Bank to be a grant of an authority to the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> to borrow in
her behalf, it should have required a special power of attorney executed by
Castro in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the bank
did not, <span class="GramE">We</span> can rightly assume that it did not
entertain the notion, that the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Valencia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
spouses were in any manner acting as an agent of Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region>
borrowed from the Bank a personal loan of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
evidenced by a promissory note (Exhibit 2) and mortgaged (Exhibit 6) Castro's
property to secure said loan, the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Valencias</span></st1:place></st1:country-region> acted for
their own behalf.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering however
that for the loan in which the <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span> appeared as
principal borrowers, it was the property of Castro that was being mortgaged to
secure said loan, the <span style="">Bank should have
exercised due care and prudence by making proper inquiry if Castro's consent to
the mortgage was without any taint or defect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The possibility of her not knowing that she signed the promissory note
(Exhibit 2) as co-maker with the <span class="SpellE">Valencias</span>, and that
her property was mortgaged to secure the two loans instead of her own personal
loan only, in view of her personal circumstances - ignorance, lack of education
and old age - should have placed the Bank on prudent inquiry to protect its
interest and that of the public it serves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With the recent occurrence of events that have supposedly affected adversely
our banking system, attributable to laxity in the conduct of bank business by
its officials, the need of extreme caution and prudence by said officials and
employees in the discharge of their functions cannot be over-emphasized.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Question is, likewise, raised as to the propriety of respondent
court's decision which declared that Castro's consignation in court of the
amount of P3<span class="GramE">,383.00</span> was validly made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It is
contended that the consignation was made without prior offer or tender of
payment to the Bank, and is therefore, not valid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding that there is a substantial
compliance with the provision of Article 1256 of the Civil Code, respondent
court considered the fact that the Bank was holding Castro liable for the sum
of P6,000.00 plus 12% interest per annum, while the amount consigned was only
P3,000.00 plus 12% interest; that at the time of consignation, the Bank had
long foreclosed the mortgage <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> and the
sale of the mortgage property had already been scheduled for April 10, 1961 for
non-payment of the obligation, and that despite the fact that the Bank already
knew of the deposit made by Castro because the receipt of the deposit was
attached to the record of the case, said Bank had not made any claim of such deposit,
and that therefore, Castro was right in thinking that it was futile and useless
for her to make previous offer and tender of payment directly to the Bank only
in the aforesaid amount of P3,000.00 plus 12% interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the foregoing circumstances, the
consignation made by Castro was valid, if not under the strict provision of the
law, under the more liberal considerations of equity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The final issue raised is the validity or invalidity of the
extrajudicial foreclosure sale at public auction of the mortgaged property that
was held on <st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1961</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners contended
that the public auction sale that was held on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="11" month="4"><span style="">April 11, 1961</span></st1:date><span style=""> which was the next business day after the
scheduled date of the sale on </span><st1:date year="1961" day="10" month="4"><span style="">April 10, 1961</span></st1:date><span style="">, a special public holiday, was permissible
and valid pursuant to the provisions of Section 31 of the Revised
Administrative Code which ordains:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Pretermission of holiday.</span> - Where
the day, or the last day, for doing any act required or permitted by law falls
on a holiday, the act may be done on the next succeeding business day."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court ruled that the aforesaid sale is null and void,
it not having been carried out in accordance with Section 9 of Act No. 3135,
which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 9.</span> - Notice shall be given
by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least three
public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated, and
if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice shall also
be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the municipality or city."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The pretermission of a holiday applies only "where the day, or the
last day for doing any act <u>required or permitted by law</u> falls on a
holiday," or when the last day of a <u>given period</u> for doing an act
falls on a holiday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not apply to
a day fixed by an office or officer of the government for an act to be done, as
distinguished from a <u>period of time</u> within which an act should be done,
which may be on any day with<span style="">in that
specified period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, if a
party is <u>required by</u> law to file his answer to a complaint within
fifteen (15) days from receipt of the summons and the last day falls on a
holiday, the last day is deemed moved to the next succeeding business day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, if the court fixes the trial of a case
on a certain day but the said date is subsequently declared </span>a <span style="">public holiday, the trial thereof is not
automatically transferred to the next succeeding business day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since April 10, 1961 was not the day or the
last day set by law for the extrajudicial foreclosure sale, nor the last day of
a given <u>period</u>, but a date fixed by the deputy sheriff, the aforesaid
sale cannot legally be made on the next succeeding business day without the
notices of the sale on that day being posted as prescribed in Section </span><span style="">9, A</span><span style="">ct No. 3135.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
