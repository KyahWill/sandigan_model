<p class="BODY">Involved in the present proceedings are two of the modes of

</span>interrogatories to parties,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>

Now, it appears to the Court that <span style="">among
far </span>too <span style="">many lawyers </span>(and
not a few judges), there is, if not a regrettable unfamiliarity and even
outright ignorance about the nature, purposes and operation of the modes of
discovery, at least a strong <span style="">y</span>et unreasoned and unreasonable disinclination to resort to them
-- which is a great pity for the intelligent and adequate use of the
deposition-discovery mechanism, coupled with pre-trial procedure, could, as the
experience of other jurisdictions convincingly demonstrates, effectively
shorten the period of litigation and speed up adjudication.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, a few words about these remedies is not at all inappropriate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of controversies is, as everyone knows, the <i>raison
</i><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">d'etre</span></i></span><span style=""> </span>of
courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This essential function is
accomplished by <i style=""><span style="">first</span></i><span style="">, </span>the ascertainment of all the material and relevant facts from
the pleadings and from the evidence adduced by the parties, and <i style=""><span style="">second</span></i><span style="">, </span>after
that determination of the facts has been completed, by the application of the
law thereto to the end that the controversy may be settled authoritatively,
definitively and finally.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for this reason that <span style="">a
</span>substantial part of the adjective law in this jurisdiction is occupied
with assuring that all the facts are indeed presented to the Court; for
obviously, to the extent that adjudication is made on the basis of incomplete
facts, to that extent there is faultiness in the approximation of objective
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus the obligation of
lawyers no less than of judges to see that this objective is attained; that is
to say, that there be no suppression, obscuration, misrepresentation or
distortion of the facts; and that no party be unaware of any fact material and
relevant to the action, or surprised by any factual detail suddenly brought to
his attention during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

described the nature and object of litigation and in the process laid down the
standards by which judicial contests are to be conducted in this
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It said:</p>

<blockquote>"A litigation is not a <span style="">game
</span>of technicalities in which one, more deeply schooled and skilled in the
subtle art of movement and position, entraps and destroys the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is rather, a contest in which <i style="">each contending party fully and fairly lays
before the court the facts in issue and then brushing aside as wholly trivial
and indecisive all imperfections of form and technicalities of procedure, asks
that justice be done on the merits</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lawsuits, unlike duels, are not to be won by a rapier's thrust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Technicality, when it deserts its proper
office as an aid to justice and becomes its great hindrance and chief enemy,
deserves scant consideration from courts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There should be no vested right in technicalities. *<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The message is plain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is the duty of each contending party to lay before the <span style="">court </span>the facts in issue -- fully and fairly; i.e., to present
to the court <i style=""><span style="">all</span></i><span style=""> </span>the material and relevant facts known to him, suppressing or
concealing nothing, nor preventing another party, by clever and adroit
manipulation of the technical rules of pleading and evidence, from also presenting
all the facts within his knowledge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Initially, that undertaking of laying the facts before the court
is accomplished by the pleadings filed by the parties; but that, only in a very
general way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only ''ultimate facts"
are set forth in the pleadings; hence, only the barest outline of the factual
basis of a party's claims or defenses is limned in his pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law says that every pleading "shall
contain in a methodical and logical form, a plain, concise and direct statement
of the <i style=""><span style="">ultimate facts</span></i><span style=""> </span>on which die party pleading relies for hits
claim or defense, as the case may be, omitting the statement of mere
evidentiary facts."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, if this requirement is not observed, i.e., the
ultimate facts are alleged too generally or "not averred with sufficient
definiteness or particularity to enable ** (an adverse party) properly to
prepare his responsive pleading or to prepare for trial," a bill of
particulars seeking a "more definite statement" may be ordered by the
court on motion of <span style="">a </span>party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The office of a bill of particulars is,
however, limited to making more particular or definite the <i style="">ultimate facts</i><span style=""> </span>in a
pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not its office to supply
evidentiary matters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the common
perception is that said evidentiary details are made known to the parties and
the court only during the trial, when proof is adduced on the issues of fact
arising from the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The truth is that "evidentiary matters" may be inquired
into and learned by the parties before the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is the purpose and policy of the
law that the parties -- before the trial if not indeed even before the
pre-trial -- should discover or inform themselves of all the facts relevant to
the action, not only those known to them individually, but also those known to
their adversaries; in other words, the <i style="">desideratum</i><span style=""> </span>is that civil trials should not be
carried on in the dark; and the Rules of Court make this ideal possible through
the deposition-discovery mechanism set forth in Rules 24 to 29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The experience in other jurisdictions has
been that ample discovery before trial, under proper regulation, accomplished
one of the most necessary ends of modern procedure:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it not only eliminates unessential issues
from trials thereby shortening them considerably, but also requires parties to
play the game with the cards on the table so that the possibility of fair
settlement before trial is measurably increased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * <span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As just intimated, the deposition-discovery procedure was
designed to remedy the conceded inadequacy and cumbersomeness of the pre-trial
functions of notice-giving, issue-formulation and fact revelation theretofore
performed primarily by the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The various modes or instruments of discovery are meant to serve
(1) as a device, along with the pre-trial hearing under Rule 20, to narrow and
clarify the basic issues between the parties, and (2) as a device for
ascertaining the facts relative to those issues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evident purpose is, to repeat, to enable
the parties, consistent with recognized privileges, to obtain the fullest
possible knowledge of the issues and facts before civil trials and thus prevent
that said trials are carried on in the dark.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To this end, the field of inquiry that may be covered by depositions

witness to testify orally at trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inquiry extends to all facts which are relevant, whether they be ultimate or
evidentiary, excepting only those matters which are privileged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The objective is as much to give every party
the fullest possible information of all the relevant facts before the trial as
to obtain evidence for use upon said trial.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">What is chiefly contemplated is the discovery of every bit of
information which may be useful in the preparation for trial, such as the
identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant <span style="">facts; those relevant facts themselves; and
the existence, description, nature, custody, condition, and location of any
books, documents, or other tangible things.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, "the deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad
and liberal treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No longer can the
time-honored cry of 'fishing expedition' serve to preclude a party from
inquiring into the facts underlying his opponent's case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mutual knowledge of all the relevant facts
gathered by both parties is essential to proper litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that end, either party may compel the
other to disgorge whatever facts he has in his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deposition-discovery procedure simply
advances the stage at which the disclosure can be compelled from the time of
trial to the period preceding it, thus reducing the possibility of surprise. *

interrogatories to parties under Rule 25, and (c) requests for admissions under
Rule 26, may be availed of <i style="">without leave

of discovery <i style="">after an answer to the

yet been filed (but after jurisdiction has been obtained over the defendant or

yet joined and the disputed facts are not clear.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, leave of court is required as regards
discovery by (a) production or inspection of documents or things in accordance
with Rule 27, or (b) physical and mental examination of persons under Rule 28,
which may be granted upon due application and a showing of due cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">To ensure that <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of the modes
of discovery is otherwise untrammeled and efficacious, the law imposes serious
sanctions on the party who refuses to make discovery, such as dismissing the
action or proceeding or part thereof, or rendering judgment by default against
the disobedient party; contempt of court, or arrest of the party or agent of
the party; payment of the amount of reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining a
court order to compel discovery; taking the matters inquired into as
established in <span style="">accordance with the
claim of the party seeking discovery; refusal to allow the disobedient party
support or oppose designated claims or defenses; striking out pleadings or
parts thereof; staying further proceedings.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

permitted to be undertaken without leave and without judicial
intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"As indicated by
(the) Rules * *, limitations inevitably arise when it can be shown that the

<p class="BODY">In fine, the liberty of a party to make discovery is well nigh
unrestricted if the matters inquired into are otherwise relevant and not
privileged, and the inquiry is made in good faith and within the bounds of the
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in light of these broad principles underlying the
deposition-discovery mechanism, in relation of course to the particular rules
directly involved, that the issues in this case will now be resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's objections to the interrogatories served on it
in accordance with Rule 25 of the Rules of Court cannot be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should initially be pointed out -- as regards the private
respondents' "Motion for Leave to File Interrogatories" dated
February 1, 1988<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
-- that it was correct for them to seek leave to serve interrogatories, because
discovery was being availed of <i style="">before</i><span style=""> </span><span style="">an answer had been served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such a situation, i.e., "after jurisdiction has been obtained over any
defendant or over property subject of the action" but before answer, Section
1 of Rule 24 (treating of depositions), in relation to Section 1 of Rule 25
(dealing with interrogatories to parties) explicitly requires "leave of
court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> But there was no need for the private
respondents to seek such leave to serve their "Amended Interrogatories to
Plaintiff” (dated </span><st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="8"><span style="">August 2, 1989</span></st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">) after they had filed their answer to the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> complaint, just as there was no need for the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> to act thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's first contention -- that the
interrogatories in question are defective because they (a) do not name the
particular individuals to whom they are propounded, being addressed only to the
PCGG, and (b) are "fundamentally <u>the same matters</u> ** (private
respondents) sought to be clarified through their aborted Motion ** for Bill of
Particulars" -- are untenable and quickly disposed of.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first part of petitioner's submission is adequately confuted
by Section 1, Rule 25 which states that if the party served with
interrogatories is a juridical entity such as "a public or private
corporation or a partnership or association," the same shall be
"answered ** by any officer thereof competent to testify in its
behalf." There is absolutely no reason why this proposition should not be
applied by analogy to the interrogatories served on the PCGG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the interrogatories are addressed only
to the PCGG, without naming any specific commissioner or officer thereof, is
utterly of no consequence, and may not be invoked as a reason to refuse to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the rule states, the interrogatories shall
be answered "by any officer thereof competent to testify in its
behalf."</p>

<p class="BODY">That the matters on which discovery is desired are the same
matters subject of a prior motion for bill of particulars addressed to the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> amended complaint -- and denied for lack of merit --
is beside the point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as already
pointed out above, a bill of particulars may elicit only <i>ultimate</i> facts,
not so-called <i style="">evidentiary</i><span style=""> </span>facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter are without doubt proper subject
of discovery.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may it be validly argued that the amended interrogatories
lack specificity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The merest glance at
them disproves the argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
interrogatories are made to relate to individual paragraphs of the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> expanded complaint and inquire about details of the
ultimate facts therein alleged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
PCGG may properly do is to object to specific items of the interrogatories, on
the ground of lack of relevancy, or privilege, or that the inquiries are being
made in bad faith, or simply to <span class="SpellE">embarass</span> or oppress <span style="">it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>But until such an objection is

interrogatories may be utilized as foundation for a counterclaim against the
PCGG or its members and officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
will be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents have
made no secret that this is in fact their intention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, the Court is unable to uphold the
proposition that while the PCGG obviously feels itself at liberty to bring
actions on the basis of its study and appreciation of the evidence in its
possession, the parties sued should not be free to file counterclaims in the
same actions against the PCGG or its officers for gross neglect or ignorance,
if not downright bad faith or malice in the commencement or initiation of such
judicial proceedings, or that in the actions that it may bring, the PCGG may
opt not to be bound by rules applicable to the parties it has sued, e.g., the
rules of discovery.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, too, the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> postulation that
none of its members may be “required to testify or produce evidence in any
judicial * * proceeding concerning matters within its official
cognizance," has no application to a judicial proceeding it has itself
initiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As just suggested, the act of
bringing suit must entail a waiver of the exemption from giving evidence; by
bringing suit it brings itself within the operation and scope of all the rules
governing civil actions, including the rights and duties under the rules of
discovery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the absurd would
have to be conceded, that while the <span style="">parties
it has <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants may be required to
"disgorge all the facts" within their knowledge and in their
possession, it may not itself be subject to a like compulsion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The State is, of course, immune from suit in the sense that it
cannot, as a rule, be sued without its consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But it is axiomatic that in filing an action, it divests itself of its
sovereign character and sheds its immunity from suit, descending to the level
of an ordinary litigant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG cannot
claim a superior or preferred status to the State, even while assuming to
represent or act for the State.<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a></p>

that the State makes no implied waiver of immunity by filing suit except when
in so doing it acts in, or in matters concerning, its proprietary or
non-governmental capacity, is unacceptable; it attempts a distinction without
support in principle or precedent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary -</p>

impliedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Express consent may be

certain limits, the right to set up whatever claims and other defenses he might
have against the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * (<span class="SpellE">Sinco</span>, Philippine Political Law, Tenth Ed., pp. 36-37,

it has been held that where private property has been taken in expropriation

<p class="BODY">The Court also finds itself unable to sustain the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> other principal contention, of the nullity of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> Order for the production and inspection of
specified documents and things allegedly in its possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court gives short shrift to the argument that some documents
sought to be produced and inspected had already been presented in Court and
marked preliminarily as <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> exhibits, the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> having in fact viewed, scrutinized and even offered
objections thereto and made comments thereon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, there is nothing secret or confidential about these
documents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No serious objection can
therefore be presented to the desire of the private respondents to have copies
of those documents in order to study them some more or otherwise use them
during the trial for any purpose allowed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCGG says that some of the documents are non-existent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This it can allege in response to the
corresponding question in the interrogatories, and it will incur no sanction
for doing so unless it is subsequently established that the denial is false.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim that use of the documents is proscribed by Executive
Order No. 1 has already been dealt with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The PCGG is however at liberty to allege and prove that said documents
fall within some other privilege, constitutional or statutory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finally finds that contrary to the petitioner's theory,
there is good cause for the production and inspection of the documents subject
of the motion dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
Some of the documents are, according to the verification of the amended
complaint, the basis of several of the material allegations of said
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Others, admittedly, are to be
used in evidence by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
matters such as these into which inquiry is precisely allowed by the rules of
discovery, to the end that the parties may adequately prepare for pre-trial and
trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only other documents sought
to be produced are needed in relation to the allegations of<span style=""> the counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their relevance is indisputable; their
disclosure may not be opposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">One last word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due no
doubt to the deplorable unfamiliarity respecting the nature, purposes and
operation of the modes of discovery earlier mentioned,<a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a>
there also appears to be a widely entertained idea that application of said
modes is a complicated matter, unduly expensive and dilatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing could be farther from the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, as will already have been noted
from the preceding discussion, all that is entailed to activate or put in
motion the process of discovery by interrogatories to parties under Rule 25 of
the Rules of Court, is simply the delivery directly to a party of a letter
setting forth a list of questions with the request that they be answered
individually.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a>
That is all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The service of such a
communication on the party has the effect of imposing on him the obligation of
answering the questions "separately and fully in writing under oath,"
and serving "a copy of the answers on the party submitting the
interrogatories within fifteen (15) days after service of the interrogatories <span style="">**."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The sanctions for refusing to make
discovery have already been mentioned.<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a>
So, too, discovery under Rule 26 is begun by nothing more complex than the
service on a party of a letter or other written communication containing a
request that specific facts therein set forth and/or particular documents
copies of which are thereto appended, be admitted in writing.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
That is all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the receipt of such
a communication by the party has the effect of imposing on him the obligation
of serving the party requesting admission with "a sworn statement either
denying specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or setting
forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully either admit or deny those
matters," failing in which "(e)ach of the matters of which admission
is requested shall be deemed admitted."<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
The taking of depositions in accordance with Rule 24 (either on oral
examination or by written interrogatories) while somewhat less simple, is
nonetheless by no means as complicated as seems to be the lamentably extensive
notion.</p>

It should be pointed out that the rulings in <i style="">PCGG v. <span class="SpellE">Peña</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">159 </span>SCRA 556 (1988) and <i style="">PCGG
v. <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, etc., et al.</i><span style="">, </span>G.R. No. 78750, April 20, 1990 are
not inconsistent with that in this proceeding, the facts and basic issues
therein involved being quite distinct from those in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike the present case, where the PCGG
instituted a civil action against <span class="SpellE">Tantoco</span>, et al. in
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, neither <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Peña</i></span><i style=""> </i><span style="">nor</span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span></i><span style=""> </span>involved any suit filed by the PCGG,
the acts therein challenged being simply its extrajudicial orders of
sequestration; and in both said cases, the Regional Trial Courts issued writs
of preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement and implementation of the
sequestration orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
nullified those injunctive writs on the ground that the PCGG, as an agency
possessed of primary administrative jurisdiction (particularly concerning
sequestration) and exercising quasi-judicial functions, was co-equal to a
Regional Trial Court which therefore had no jurisdiction to review or otherwise
restrain or interfere with its acts, that power being exclusively lodged <span style="">in the </span><span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, subject only to review by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Nepomuceno</i></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">it was </span>additionally
ruled that there was <i style="">prima</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">facie</i><span style=""> </span>basis for the challenged order of
sequestration; that the take-over of the property in question by the PCGG
fiscal agents was necessitated as much by the resistance and defiance of the
holders thereof to the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> authority as by the
desire of the PCGG to preserve said property; and that since the power to seize
property to conserve it pending the institution of suit for <span style="">its </span>recovery
was sanctioned by the Freedom Constitution and the 1987 Constitution, the PCGG
must be deemed immune from any suit which would render that authority inutile
or ineffectual.</p>
