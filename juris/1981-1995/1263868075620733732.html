a </span>regulated or prohibited drug.</p>

<p class="BODY">After arraignment and trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
rendered in due time, on 14 March 1988, a decision finding the accused guilty
of violating Article III, Section 15 of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, and
sentencing him to life imprison­ment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant ascribes the following errors to the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in admitting as
evidence the alleged two (2) packets of <span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>
as the <span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span><u> </u>supposedly seized from the
accused when it was never authenticated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The lower court erred in not ruling that the
prosecution failed to prove the guilt of the accused.</blockquote>

evidence Exhibit "B," when there is no proof that accused was advised
of his constitutional right to refuse to sign said exhibit.</blockquote>

exculpatory weight to the evidence of the defense."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"
was declared forfeited to the Government and ordered turned over to the Dangerous
Drugs Board for proper disposal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence presented by the People tended to establish the
following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="3">11 March 1987</st1:date>, an unnamed informant
reported to P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. Jose S. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>
of the 13th Narcotics Regional Unit, Narcotics Command, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
that one Oscar Fabian alias "Boy Pena," was selling "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pulang-Lupa</span>, Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>, Metro
Manila. After evaluation of the information, <span style="">a </span>"buy-bust" operation team
<span style="">was </span>organized, composed of P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> as team leader, and P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. Lolita O. <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span> and
Patrolman Rolando Geronimo as members.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 p.m.</st1:time> of
the same day, Pat. Geronimo acting as "poseur-buyer," together with
the unnamed informant, met Oscar Fabian outside the latter's hide-out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After an exchange of pleasantries between
Fabian and the informant, the latter introduced Patrolman Geronimo to the
former as <span style="">a </span>"good
buyer." Geronimo asked Fabian whether the latter had <span style="">"<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"
</span>to sell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fabian answered in the
affirmative and drew from his right front pants’ pocket an aluminum foil packet<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and tossed it to Geronimo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Geronimo
ascertained that the contents of the aluminum foil packet were <span style="">"<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"</span>
and then gave the pre-arranged signal consisting of scratching his head with
his right hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other team members who
had been observing Patrolman Geronimo and appellant Fabian from a distance,
closed in immediately and proceeded to search the person of appellant
Fabian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The search yielded another tin
foil packet<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
from the same front pants' pocket of Fabian.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> looked
at the contents of the packet and put it away.</p>

<p class="BODY">P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span>
apprised appellant Fabian of his constitu­tional rights and asked him to sign
the on-the-spot receipt <span style="">for </span>the
confiscated tin foil packets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant
was then brought to the 13<sup>th</sup> Narcotics Command Headquarters at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
where he was referred to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Wenceslao</span> <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> Jr. for investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">At <st1:time minute="45" hour="0">12:45 a.m.</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">12 March 1987</st1:date>, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> took custody of the two (2) tin foil packets attached
by tape to a sheet of bond paper,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the receipt for the confiscated items signed by appellant Fabian,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the joint affidavit of arrest signed by the arresting officers<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and the person of appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
A request for chemical analysis of the substance found in the confiscated tin
foil packets attached to the sheet of bond paper was sent in to the Philippine
Constabulary Crime Laboratory at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock
 a.m.</st1:time> of the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>
asked appellant whether the signature appearing on the confiscation receipt was
his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant answered in the
affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> then apprised him of his constitutional rights and
asked him if he wished to exercise them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant answered in the affirmative and henceforth remained silent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant presented a different version of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="3">11 March 1987</st1:date>, as he was resting in his house after the
day's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Geronimo came by
and inquired whether he (Fabian) had noticed anyone running by his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fabian replied that he had not noticed anyone
passing or running by his house;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patrolman Geronimo left and presumably continued <span style="">his </span>search elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly however, and quite suddenly, Patrolman Geronimo with some
companions showed up again at <span style="">Fabian's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They kicked in the door of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside, Patrolman Geronimo
demanded that </span>appellant Fabian produce the <span style="">"<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" </span>the latter <span style="">was </span>hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Geronimo's companions searched
Fabian's house, destroying some of the walls in the process, but found
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patrolman Geronimo and
companion allegedly took a table clock and an "<span class="SpellE"><u>alkansiya</u></span>"
belonging to Fabian's wife, and arrested Fabian as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fabian was brought to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Crame</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style=""> </span>with other persons who appeared to
have been likewise arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fabian continued that at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
Patrolman Geronimo asked him for <span style="">P4,000.00
</span>so that Fabian could be released with other persons who had already paid
a similar amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because Fabian had no
money to give, he was not released but was subsequently transferred to the Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span> Municipal <span style="">Jail.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, moreover, pointed to the report of Forensic Chemist <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, which
described the specimens submitted to her for chemical analysis in the following
terms:</p>

<blockquote>"Ex. A -- <u>28.9 milligrams</u> of white crystals wrapped
with aluminum foil and placed in a small transparent plastic bag.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Ex. B -- <u>2.1 milligrams</u> of white crystals wrapped with
aluminum foil and placed in a small transparent plastic bag.” (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Appellant's counsel adverted to the fact
that in Exhibit "B", to which Exhibits "B-1" and
"B-2" were attached and taped, described said Exhibits
"B-1" and "B-2" as being "approximately <u>1/8 of </u><u><span style="">a gram</span></u><span style=""> </span>of
suspected "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since 1/8 of a gram is equivalent to 125
milligrams, appellant suggests that the differences in the weights of tin foil
packets which were examined by Forensic Chemist <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
indicated that the original packets received or taken from appellant Fabian may
well have been substituted with other aluminum foil packets by the time they
had reached the PC Crime Laboratory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The force of this <span style="">suggestion
</span>is more apparent than real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
members of the police "buy-bust" team who went to <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pulang-Lupa</span>, Las <span class="SpellE">Piñas</span>,
were obviously not equipped with scientific precision weighing
instruments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The description of the packets
as constituting approximately 1/8 of <span style="">a </span>gram of suspected "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" was, in all probability, as pointed out
by the Solicitor General, due to the fact -- well-known to the police officers
-- that "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" is commonly sold in
the streets in commercial packets of approximately 1/8 of a gram each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arresting officers merely assumed that
the packets derived from appellant <span style="">Fabian
were </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">"normal" commercial </span>weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference <span style="">between 125 </span>milligrams <span style="">and
28.9 or 2.1 </span>milligrams is too minute to be detectable by hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Fabian's principal argument relates to the <span style="">alleged </span>failure of the prosecution
sufficiently to authenticate what appellant described as the "chain of
custody" over the "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"
allegedly seized from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fabian
argues that the prosecution had failed to trace or account for the movement of
the seized tin foil packets, obviously to cast doubt on whether the tin foil
packets found to contain "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"
were in fact the very same packets seized from appellant Fabian by the
arresting officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the packets
was tossed by Fabian to Patrolman Geronimo while the other was taken by P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> from the person of
Fabian when the latter was searched on the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both packets were held by P/<span class="SpellE">Pfc</span>. <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> who in turn delivered
them to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, as
the investigating officer assigned to the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> sent the tin foil packets
later in the morning to the PC Crime Labora­tory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The packets were <span class="SpellE">handcarried</span>
by one Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Larigado</span> (referred to as a
"courier" in the trial court's decision) and delivered to P/Capt. <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, the Forensic
Chemist who conducted a chemical analysis of the contents of the packets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not all the persons through whose hands the
tin foil packets actually or physically passed, were presented as witnesses
before the trial court to authenti­cate the tin foil packets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellant argues, the process of
authentication was incomplete.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not persuaded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstance that some of the persons through whose hands the seized
items had passed were not presented as witnesses before the trial court, is not
by itself sufficient to show that the contents of the packets had been
switched, or that the packets which had been taken from appellant Fabian had
been substituted with other packets containing "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>."
In the first place, all the persons who obtained and received the tin foil
packets did so in the course of <span style="">performance
</span>of official duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
presumption that official duty <span style="">was </span>regularly
performed was not overthrown by appellant's counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing that the original
packets contained some substance other than "<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>"
and that the original packets were switched for the packets actually delivered
to and chemically examined by Police Chemist <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
indispensable that the prosecution allege and prove every single fact of the
case.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Once the facts upon which is presumption established by law stands are shown,
it is incumbent upon the adverse party to overthrow that presumption by
sufficient and convincing evidence:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a
mere allegation is not evidence and is not adequate to dissolve the
presumption.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, the arresting officers are presumed to have regularly and
faithfully performed their respective duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in the record to show that they changed the innocent
contents of the tin foil packets originally taken from appellant Fabian with
packets containing the prohibited drug “<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>.”
There is further no evidence on record tending to show that the testimonies of
all the prosecution witnesses were pure fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sinister ulterior motives on the part of
the arresting officers or any of the prosecution witnesses were shown by
appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant asks us to draw all kinds of inferences from the fact that the
original arresting officer did not personally hand-deliver the confiscated
packets to the PC Crime Laboratory to avoid any possibility of tampering with
or switching the packets and their contents with constituted evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, as pointed out by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>"There are proper procedures which apprehend­ing officers must
follow with regard to the criminals as well as to the disposition of the
evidence seized in connection with their arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These procedures must be followed for the
smooth administration of police functions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would have been highly irregular for Geronimo to have personally
brought the packets of "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>" to the <span style="">chemist and in the process, bypassing <span class="SpellE">Leano</span>, the investigating officer assigned to the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Geronimo has no authority to directly submit
items for testing."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also assails the "buy-bust" operation as
illegal because the "poseur-buyer" had not been given any money for
the purchase of the “<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span><u>”</u> and because
the identity of the alleged informant was not revealed in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contended further that it was
"incredible" that appellant as a supposed drug pusher would sell
"<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span>" right in front of his own
home.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has several times stressed that the offense of illegal
sale of a prohibited drug is committed once a sale transaction was
consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence of actual
monetary consideration is not indispensable for the existence of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People v. de la Cruz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court stated that when a police officer went through the motions of buying
prohibited drugs and his offer to buy was accepted by the accused-seller, the
crime was consummated by <span style="">mere </span>delivery
of the drug purchased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that no
money was actually delivered by the pretended buyer to the accused-seller did
not prevent the offense from being committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the identity of the informant was not disclosed and the
informant presented in court, does not fatally prejudice the People's
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the unnamed informant
would have been corroborative at best.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mounting of the "buy-bust" operation was sufficiently
established by Pat. Geronimo who had personal knowledge thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found the testimony of
Patrolman Geronimo convincing and quite adequate:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>By
and large, the testimony of Pat. Rolando Geronimo, the poseur-buyer, <span style="">was </span>candid and straight forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He categorically and positively declared it
was accused who delivered to him the aluminum foil which turned out to contain
approxi­mately [1/8] gram of <span class="SpellE">shabu</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, accused was arrested by <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bugarin</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Found in his person was another aluminum foil
likewise <span style="">containing <span class="SpellE">shabu</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Geronimo's graphic narration of how this
event came about is logical and reasonable</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (</span><span style="">Underscoring added)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Moreover, we are unable to accord
substantial weight to appellant's argument that it was "incredible"
and "ridiculous" for a drug pusher to sell “<span class="SpellE"><u>shabu</u></span><u>”</u>
in front of his house and to a stranger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court has noted many times in the past that retail drug pushers sell
their prohibited wares to customers, be they strangers or not, in private as
well as in public places.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, carrying out such sales in public tends to dissimulate the criminal
nature of the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also pointed to supposed inconsistencies in the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those inconsistencies, if that is what they were, were however minor and
inconsequential in character, having been sufficiently explained during the
trial and the explanations having been accepted by the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The supposed inconsistencies did not in any case affect the credibility of the
witnesses referred to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable
principle is that the assessments by the trial court of the credibility and
sincerity of the various witnesses who testified before the court are accorded
great respect by appellate courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant finally assails the admission into the record of
Exhibit "B," the on-the-spot receipt signed on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="3">11 March 1987</st1:date> by appellant at the time of his
arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contends that Exhibit
"B" should not have been admitted because there was no proof that he
had signed said receipt <u>after</u>, rather than before, he was informed of
his constitutional rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "B" is not to be confused with Exhibit
"E."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While both Exhibits are
confiscation receipts signed by the appellant, Exhibit "B" is a
handwritten receipt which included the items seized from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, Exhibit "E" is a
printed form, which included a description (but not the actual items) of what
had been seized from appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit
"E" was in fact excluded by the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>quo</u> during trial upon the
ground that it was in the nature of an extrajudicial confession which had been
given after an <span class="SpellE">uncounseled</span> waiver of appellant’s
constitutional rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant is
trying similarly to exclude from the record Exhibit "B."</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "B" is a sheet of white bond paper on which the
two (2) tin foil packets (Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2") seized
from appellant were taped after each had been placed in a small bag of clear
plastic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "B" also
contained the following statements handwritten in block letters:</p>

<blockquote>"'B' -- <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="3">11 March 1987</st1:date></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>do not think above argument has any necessary impact on the conclusions
reached by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming (<span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> merely) that the descriptive statements
found in Exhibit "B," when coupled with the signature of appellant Fabian,
partake of the nature of an extrajudicial confession, those statements and
signature may in any case be disregarded and excluded; those statements and
signature are properly regarded as identification marks merely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "B" is simply the paper mounting
of the packets of "<span class="SpellE">shabu</span>" marked as
Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2." What is important is that
Exhibits "B-1" and "B-2" were in fact identified in the
testimony of Patrolman Geronimo as having been received (in the case of Exhibit
"B-1") from appellant Fabian and taken (in the case of Exhibit
"B-2") from Fabian's right front 'pants' pocket on 11 March 1987.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>
