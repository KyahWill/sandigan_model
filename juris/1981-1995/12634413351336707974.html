<p class="BODY">We find the petition impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is meet to discuss the historical background of the JUSMAG to
determine its immunity from suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">JUSMAG was created pursuant to the Military Assistance Agreement<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
dated March 21, 1947, between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines
and the Government of the United States of America.  As agreed upon, JUSMAG shall consist of Air, Naval and Army
group, and its primary task was to advise and assist the Philippines, on air
force, army and naval matters.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 14 of the 1947 Agreement provides, <i>inter </i><i><span style="">alia</span></i><span style="">, </span>that “the cost of all services required by the Group,
including compensation of <b><i><span style="">locally
</span>employed interpreters, clerks, laborers, and other personnel</i></b><i>,</i><b>
</b>except personal servants, shall be borne by the Republic of the
Philippines.”</p>

<p class="BODY">This set-up was to change in 1991.  In Note No. 22, addressed to the Department of Foreign Affairs
(DFA) of the Philippines, dated January 23, 1991, the Unites States Government,
thru its Embassy, manifested its preparedness <b><span style="">“<i>to provide funds to cover the salaries </i></span><i>of security
assistance support personnel</i> </b><span style="">and
security guards, the rent of JUSMAG occupied buildings and housing, and the
cost of utilities.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This offer was accepted by our Government,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Consequently, a </span><b><i>Memorandum

Philippines and JUSMAG-Philippines, thru General Lisandro C. Abadia and U.S.
Brigadier General Robert G. Sausser.  The Agreement delineated the terms of the assistance-in-kind of JUSMAG
for 1991, the relevant parts of which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“a. The term salaries as used in this agreement include those for
the security guards currently contracted between JUSMAG and A’ Prime Security
Services Inc., and the <b><i><span style="">Security
Assistance Support Personnel </span></i></b><span style="">(SASP).  x x x.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“b. The term Security Assistance Support Personnel (SASP) does <b><i><span style="">not </span></i></b>include active duty
uniformed members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines performing duty at
JUSMAG.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c. <b><i>It is understood that SASP are employees of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines (AFP).  </i></b><span style="">Therefore, </span><b><i>the AFP agrees to
appoint, for service with JUSMAG, no more than 74 personnel </i></b><span style="">to designated positions with JUSMAG.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“d. <b><i>SASP are under the total operational control of the
Chief, JUSMAG-Philippines.  </i></b><span style="">The </span>term “Operational Control”
includes, but is not limited to, all personnel administrative actions, such <span style="">as:  </span>hiring
recommendations; firing recommendations; position classification; discipline;
nomination and approval of incentive awards; and payroll computation.  Personnel administration will be guided by
Annex E of JUSMAG-Philippines Memo <span style="">10-2.  </span><b><i>For the period of time that
there is an exceptional funding agreement between the government of the
Philippines and the United States Government (USG), JUSMAG will pay the total
payroll costs for the SASP employees.  </i></b>Payroll
costs include only regular salary; approved overtime; costs of living
allowance; medical insurance; regular contributions to the Philippine Society
Security System, PAG­-IBIG Fund and Personnel Economic Relief Allowance (PERA);
and the thirteenth-month bonus.  Payroll
costs do not include gifts or other bonus payments in addition to those
previously defined above.  Entitlements
not considered payroll costs under this agreement will be funded and paid by
the AFP.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“e. All SASP employed </span><b><i>as
of July 1, 1990 will continue their service with JUSMAG at their current rate
of pay and benefits up to 30 June 1991, with an annual renewal of employment
thereafter </i></b><span style="">subject to renewal
of their appointment with the AFP (employees and rates of pay are indicated at
Enclosure 3).  No promotion or transfer
internal to JUSMAG of the listed personnel will result in the reduction of
their pay and benefits.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“f. All SASP will, after proper classification, be paid salaries
and benefits at established AFP civilian rates.  Rules for computation of pay and allowances will be made
available to the Comptroller, JUSMAG, by the Comptroller, GHQ, AFP.  Additionally, any legally mandated changes
in salary levels or methods of computation shall be transmitted within 48 hours
of receipt by Comptroller, GHQ to Comptroller, JUSMAG.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“g. The AFP agrees not to terminate SASP without 60 days prior
written notice to Chief, JUSMAG-Philippines.  Any termination of these personnel thought to be necessary because of
budgetary restrictions or manpower ceiling will be subject to consultations
between AFP and JUSMAG to ensure that JUSMAG’s mission of dedicated support to
the AFP will not be degraded or harmed in any way. </blockquote>

<blockquote>“h. <b><i>The AFP agrees to assume the severance pay/retirement pay
liability for all appointed SASP.  </i></b>(Enclosure
3 lists the severance pay liability date for current SASP).  Any termination of services, other than
voluntary resignations or termination for cause, will result in immediate
payments of <span style="">AFP of all termination pay
to the entitled employee.  Vouchers for
severance/retirement pay and accrued bonuses and annual leave will be presented
to the Comptroller, GHQ, AFP, not later than 14 calendar days prior to required
date of payment.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“i.  All SASP listed in
Enclosure 3 will continue to participate in the Philippine Social Security
System.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A year later, or in 1992, the United States Embassy sent another
note of similar import to the Department of Foreign Affairs (No. 227, dated
April 8, 1992), extending the funding agreement for the salaries of SASP and
security guards until December 31, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is apparent that when JUSMAG took the
services of private respondent, it was performing a governmental function on
behalf of the United States pursuant to the Military Assistance Agreement dated
March 21, 1947.  Hence, we agree with
petitioner that the suit is, in effect, one against the United States Government,
albeit it was not impleaded in the complaint.  Considering that the United States has not waived or consented to the
suit, the complaint against JUSMAG cannot not prosper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this jurisdiction, we
recognize and adopt the generally accepted principles of international law as
part of the law of the land.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><b><i>Immunity of State from suit</i>

state and its organs from the judicial jurisdiction of another state.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This is anchored on the principle of the
sovereign equality of states under which one state cannot assert jurisdiction
over another in violation of the maxim </span><b><i><span style="">par in parem non habet imperium</span></i></b><b><span style=""> </span></b><span style="">(an equal has no power over an equal).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the </span><i><span style="">traditional rule of State immunity</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">a state cannot be sued in the courts of another State, without its
consent or waiver.  However, in </span><b><i><span style="">Santos, et al., vs. Santos, et al.</span></i></b><i><span style="">,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">we
recognized an exception to the doctrine of immunity from suit by a state, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“x x x.  Nevertheless, if,
where and when the state or its government enters into a contract, through its
officers or agents, in furtherance of a legitimate aim and purpose and pursuant
to constitutional legislative authority, whereby mutual or reciprocal benefits
accrue and rights and obligations arise therefrom, and if the law granting the
authority to enter into such contract does not provide for or name the officer
against whom action may be brought in the event of a breach thereof, <b><i>the
state itself may be sued, even without its consent, because by entering into a
contract, the sovereign state has descended to the level of the citizen and its
consent to be sued is implied from the very act of entering into such contract</i></b>.  x x x.” (emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was in this light that the state immunity issue in <b><i>Harry
Lyons, Inc., vs. Unites States of America</i></b><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">was decided.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case of </span><i>Harry
Lyons, Inc</i>., <span style="">the petitioner entered
into a contract with the United States Government for stevedoring services at
the U.S. Naval </span>Base, Subic Bay, Philippines.  It then sought to collect from the <span style="">US </span>government sums of money arising from the contract.  One of the issues posed in the case was
whether or not the defunct Court of First Instance had jurisdiction over the
defendant United States, a sovereign state which cannot be sued without its
consent.  This Court upheld the
contention of Harry Lyons, Inc., that “when a sovereign state enters into a
contract with a private person, the state can be sued upon the theory that it
has descended to the level of an individual from which it can be implied that
it has given its consent to be sued under the contract.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The doctrine of state
immunity from suit has undergone further metamorphosis.  The view evolved that the existence of a
contract does not, </span><i>per se</i>, mean<span style=""> that sovereign states may, at all times, be sued in local courts.  The complexity of relationships between
sovereign states, brought about by their increasing commercial activities,
mothered a more </span><i>restrictive</i> <span style="">application
of the doctrine.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus, in </span><b><i>United States of
America vs. Ruiz</i></b><i>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">we clarified that our </span><span style="">pronouncement in </span><i>Harry Lyons</i>, <i>supra</i>,
<span style="">with respect to the waiver of State
immunity, was </span><i>obiter</i> <span style="">and
“has no value as an imperative authority.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As it stands now, the
application of the doctrine of immunity from suit has been </span><b><i>restricted</i>
</b><span style="">to </span><b><i>sovereign</i> </b><span style="">or </span><b><i>governmental activities (jure
imperii)</i>.</b><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">The mantle of state immunity </span><b><i>cannot</i>
</b><span style="">be extended to </span><b><i>commercial,
private and proprietary acts (jure gestionis)</i></b>.  <span style="">As
aptly stated by this Court </span>(<i>En</i> <i>banc</i>)<span style=""> in </span><i>US vs. Ruiz, supra</i>: <i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>“The restrictive application of State immunity <span style="">is </span>proper when the proceedings arise
out of commercial transactions of the foreign sovereign, its commercial
activities or economic affairs.  Stated
differently, a State may be said to have descended to the level of an
individual and thus can be deemed to have tacitly given its consent to be sued <b><i><span style="">only</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>when it enters into <b><i><span style="">business
contracts</span></i></b><span style="">.<b> </b>  </span>It does <b><i><span style="">not</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>apply
where the contract relates to the exercise of its <b><i><span style="">sovereign functions</span></i></b><span style="">.”<b>
</b></span>(emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We held further, that the application of
the doctrine of state immunity depends on the <i>legal nature</i> of the <span style="">act.  </span><i>Ergo</i>,
since a <b><i>governmental function</i> </b>was <span style="">involved -- the transaction dealt with the improvement of the </span>wharves
in the naval installation at Subic Bay -- it was held that the United States
was not deemed to have waived its immunity from suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then came the case of </span><b><i>United
States vs. Hon. Rodrigo, et al</i>.</b><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">In said case, Genove was employed as a cook
in the Main Club located at U.S. Air Force </span>Recreation Center, John Hay
Air Station.  He was dismissed from
service after he was found to have polluted the stock of soup with urine.  Genove countered with a complaint for
damages.  Apparently, the restaurant
services offered at the John Hay Air Station partake of the nature of a
business enterprise undertaken by the United States government in its <i><span style="">proprietary capacity</span></i><span style="">.  </span>The
Court then noted that the restaurant is well known and available to the general
public, thus, the services are operated for profit, as a commercial and not a
governmental activity.  Speaking through
Associate Justice Isagani Cruz, the Court (<i>En</i> <i><span style="">Banc</span></i><span style="">) </span>said:</p>

<blockquote>“The consequence of this finding is that the petitioners cannot
invoke the doctrine of state immunity to justify the dismissal of the damage
suit against them by Genove.  Such
defense will not prosper even if it be established that they were acting as
agents of the United States when they investigated and later dismissed Genove.  For that matter, not even the United States
government itself can claim such immunity.  The reason <span style="">is </span>that by
entering into the employment contract with Genove <b><i>in the discharge of its
</i></b><b><i><span style="">proprietary functions</span></i></b><span style="">,<b> </b></span>it impliedly divested itself
of its <span style="">sovereign immunity from suit.”
(emphasis ours)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Conversely, if the contract was entered into in the discharge of
its <b><i>governmental functions</i></b>,<b> </b>the sovereign state cannot be
deemed to have waived its immunity from suit.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> Such
is the case at bench.  Prescinding from this
premise, we need not determine whether JUSMAG controls the employment
conditions of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also hold that there appears to be no basis for public
respondent to rule that JUSMAG is estoppel from denying the existence of
employer-employee relationship with private respondent.  On the contrary, in its Opposition before
the public respondent, JUSMAG consistently contended that the (74) SASP,
including private respondent, working in JUSMAG, are employees of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines.  This can be
gleaned from:  (1) the Military
Assistance Agreement, <i>supra</i>, (2) the exchange of notes between our
Government, thru Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Unites States, thru the
US Embassy to the Philippines, and (3) the Agreement on May 21, 1991, <i>supra</i>,
between the Armed Forces of the Philippines and JUSMAG.</p>

<p class="BODY">We symphatize with the plight of private respondent who had
served JUSMAG for more than twenty (20) years.  Considering his length of service with JUSMAG, he deserves a more compassionate
treatment.  Unfortunately, JUSMAG is
beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.  Nonetheless, the Executive branch, through the Department of Foreign
Affairs and the Armed Forces of the Philippines, can take the cudgel for
private respondent and the other SASP working for JUSMAG, pursuant to the
aforestated Military Assistance Agreement.</p>
