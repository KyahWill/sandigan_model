				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Appeal from the February 18, 1966 order of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila dismissing Civil Case No. 63688 on the ground that the same had been 
pre­maturely filed. 
<p>This is one of the several cases that reached this Court in connection with 
the 1964 labor dispute between the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company 
and the Free Telephone Workers Union. </p>
<p>In a complaint filed on December 20, 1965, in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, against the Free Telephone Workers Union and 26 other persons named 
therein, plaintiff Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company alleged that on 
November 3, 1964, the President of the Philippines certified to the Court of 
Industrial Relations the labor dispute between the Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Company and Free Telephone Workers Union over the terms and conditions 
of employment of the company's rank-and-file employees and the labor dispute was 
docketed as CIR Case No. 51-IPA, entitled "Free Telephone Workers' Union versus 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company" and on November 9, 1964, the Court 
of Industrial Relations rendered a partial decision, directing, inter alia: "x x 
x It shall be understood that during the pendency of the case, the Union shall 
not strike or walk out of their employment; and the Company shall not lock out 
its employees as public interest demands, considering that the Court, in its 
opinion, cannot promptly settle or decide the dispute (italics supplied)"; that 
on May 17, 1965, in spite of the above-quoted directive of the Court of 
Industrial Relations and in complete disregard of the fact that CIR Case No. 
51-IPA was and still is pending before said Court, defendant Union, through its 
officers, filed with the Department of Labor a notice of strike against the 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company; that in view of the evident 
intention of defendant union and its officers to disregard the aforestated 
no-strike directive of the Court of Industrial Relations, the Philippine Long 
Distance Telephone Company, on June 2, 1965, filed with the Court of Industrial 
Relations a petition for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, 
praying that the intended strike of defendant union be restrained, which 
petition was docketed in the Court of Industrial Relations as CIR Case No. 
51-IPA (2); that on July 6, 1965, the Court of Industrial Relations issued an 
order restraining defendant union from going on strike pending the resolution by 
the Court of a motion to dismiss filed by defendant union in CIR Case No. 51-IPA 
(2); that in contemptuous disregard of this second restraining order of July 6, 
1965 of the Court of Industrial Relations, the individual defendants herein, as 
officers of defendant union, held a meeting on July 6, 1965, after they had 
received a copy of the said July 6, 1965 order, and in that meeting decided to 
stage a strike, as in fact they did, on July 7, 1965; that the strike declared 
on July 7, 1965 continued until August 11, 1965 even as the Court of Industrial 
Relations on July 16, 1965, had issued in CIR Case No. 51-IPA (2) another order 
requiring the striking employees to call off the strike and to lift their picket 
lines and further directing the striking employees "x x x to return to work 
within three (3) days from receipt of a copy of this order by [petitioner]; 
otherwise if they or any of them fail to do so, considering that as has been 
found by the President of the Philippines the business of respondent is coupled 
with national interest, the management of Philippine Long Distance Telephone 
Company is hereby authorized to replace any and all of them in virtue of Section 
19 of C.A. 103, as amended, provided, however, that employees who shall have 
been replaced may be reinstated by the Court after due hearing and after 
establishing good and valid grounds for their failure to return to work as 
directed x x x; that in wanton violation of the above-quoted order of the Court 
of Industrial Relations, defendants resumed the strike on August 13, 1965 and 
continued the same until August 24, 1965; that apart from declaring the strike 
on July 7, 1965 and resuming it on August 13, 1965, defendants compounded their 
defiance of the no-strike and return-to-work directives of the Court of 
Industrial Relations by inducing and instigating others through misleading 
propaganda and intensive campaigns to commit the same act of open defiance of 
the Court; and that as a result of all these wrongful and unlawful acts of 
defendants, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company was adversely 
affected, causing it to suffer for the period from July 7 to August 24, 1965, an 
actual damage of not less than P599,603.00; that the aforesaid damage being the 
result of the wrongful and unlawful acts and conduct of the defendants, said 
defendants are liable to the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company for the 
indemnity of such damage; that since defendants acted in an oppressive and 
unlawful manner, exemplary damage should be imposed upon them by way of example 
or correction for the public good and in favor of the Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Company, the amount of P30,000.00; and that for the institution of 
this act, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company obtained the services of 
counsel to whom the plaintiff is bound to pay the sum of P10,000.00 as 
attorney's fees (pp. 6-17 ROA; p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>Thereafter, in a motion dated January 5, 1966, defendants prayed for the 
dismissal of the complaint on the ground that (1) the Court of First Instance 
has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint because the same is 
intertwined with a labor dispute now pending before the Court of Industrial 
Relations; (2) that even assuming that the Court of First Instance has 
juris­diction, the complaint stated no cause of action because the law does not 
allow recovery of damages arising from a strike; (3) that on the same 
jurisdictional assumption, the claim for damages arising from the strike has 
been extinguished because the plaintiff has already admitted to work the 
rank-and-file employees who themselves voted for the strike; and (4) that the 
complaint has been prematurely filed because the question of the strike's 
legality is still pending before the Court of Industrial Relations and that even 
the jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations in assuming compulsory 
powers over the labor dispute in CIR Case No. 51-IPA(2) is still pending review 
before the Supreme Court in G.R. No. L-24827 (pp. 18-25, ROA, p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>On January 12, 1966, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company filed its 
opposition to defendants' motion to dismiss, maintaining that the lower court 
has jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaint, that defendants are 
liable for the damages prayed for in the complaint; that the temporary 
reinstatement of strikers did not constitute waiver thereof; and that the filing 
of the said complaint was not premature (pp. 26-35, ROA, p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>On January 15, 1966, the lower court, through Hon. Judge Francisco Geronimo, 
issued an order denying defendants' motion to dismiss and holding that it has 
jurisdiction over the case (p. 36, ROA; p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>Whereupon, under date of January 22, 1966, defend­ants filed a motion for 
reconsideration on the sole ground that even assuming arguendo that the Court of 
First Instance has jurisdiction over the case, the cause of action has not yet 
accrued because the question of strike legality upon which depends the right of 
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company to claim damages has yet to be 
decided as the same is still pending determination by the Court of Industrial 
Relations (pp. 38-41, ROA; p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>On February 4, 1966, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company filed its 
opposition to defendants' motion for reconsideration, contending that the 
question of the strike's illegality has nothing to do whatsoever with the 
complaint for damages (pp. 46-48, ROA; p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>On February 5, 1966, the lower court entered an order requiring the parties, 
in view of the importance of the question raised, to submit simultaneous 
memoranda. Accordingly, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company filed its 
memorandum on February 17, 1966 (pp. 77-155, ROA; p. 9, rec.), while defendants 
filed theirs earlier on February 8, 1966 (pp. 49-76, ROA; p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>On February 18, 1966, the lower court issued its resolution granting 
defendants' motion for reconsideration and dismissing, without prejudice, 
plaintiff's complaint, on the ground that the action has been prematurely filed, 
thus: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"x x x In the order of this Court dated January 15, 1966, the motion to 
dismiss filed by the defendants was denied on the ground that the court holds 
that it has jurisdiction over the case. In the motion for reconsideration filed 
by the defendants, the ground alleged is amplified by alleging further that even 
conceding that the court has jurisdiction over this case, the cause of action 
which would give rise to damages has not yet accrued. </p>
<p>"A reading of the complaint filed by the plaintiff in this case shows that it 
is claiming damages as a result of the alleged wrongful and unlawful acts of the 
defendants in declaring a strike on July 7, 1965, which was continued up to 
August 24, 1965, in defiance of the Orders of the Court of Industrial Relations, 
enjoining the defendants from declaring a strike. It appears, however, that the 
legality of the Orders of the Court of Industrial Relations enjoining the 
defendants from declaring a strike is at present an issue squarely raised before 
the Supreme Court and has not yet been decided. It would seem, therefore, that 
the basis of the action of the plaintiff rests upon the proposition that the 
strikes declared by the defendants in violation of the Orders of the Court of 
Industrial Relations were unlawful. On the other hand, plaintiff contends in 
their memorandum that the declaration of the legality or illegality of the 
strike by the Court of Industrial Relations is not a condition precedent to the 
filing of an action for damages arising from a strike. Both parties have 
submitted well-reasoned memoranda, replete with authorities sustaining both 
sides of the question. </p>
<p>"After a careful consideration of the issues raised, the Court finds that in 
reality, the action filed by the plaintiff depends upon the ultimate resolution 
of whether or not the strike declared by the defendants on July 7, 1965, up to 
August 24, 1965, in violation of the Orders of the Court of Industrial Relations 
were unlawful. Should the Orders of the Court of Industrial Relations enjoining 
the defendants from declaring a strike be found by the Supreme Court to have not 
been validly issued, and, therefore, the strikes declared by the defendants were 
lawful, it may be asked: Upon what basis can the action of the plaintiff for 
damages as a result of the lawful strike declared by the defendants be 
sustained? To uphold the action of the plaintiff in this instant case, this 
court necessarily has to determine whether the strikes declared by the 
defendants were legal or not. Since this matter is now pending before the 
Supreme Court and the Court of Industrial Relations, this Court is of the 
opinion, and so holds, that until that issue is definitely settled there seems 
to be no sufficient legal basis at least for the present for the action for 
damages allegedly sustained by the plaintiff as a consequence of the strikes 
declared by the defendants. </p>
<p>"x x x x" (pp. 101-103, rec.). </p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, this appeal of plaintiff Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, 
hereinafter referred to as appellant, from the aforesaid order of dismissal of 
its complaint for damages against Free Telephone Workers Union and the other 
defendants named therein, hereinafter referred to as appellees. </p>
<p>Notice of appeal and appeal bond were filed by appellant on March 15, 1966 
while the Record on Appeal was filed on March 16, 1966 which was approved by the 
trial court in its order dated March, 1966. </p>
<p>On May 30, 1966, appellant filed with this Court its printed Record on Appeal 
(p. 9, rec.). </p>
<p>Appellant thereafter filed its brief (p. 15, rec.) on July 28, 1966; while 
appellees filed theirs (p. 16, rec.) on August 7, 1966. A reply (p. 34, rec.) 
was filed by appellant on September 22, 1966. </p>
<p>Accordingly, the appeal was submitted for decision. </p>
<p>In its brief, appellant Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company insists 
that the lower court erred in dismissing its complaint on the ground that the 
same had been prematurely filed and argued that the declaration of strike 
illegality by the Court of Industrial Relations is not a condition precedent to 
the filing of an action with the Court of First Instance for damages arising 
from a strike; that the lower court's dismissal of its complaint for damages is 
for a ground not specified in the New Rules of Court; and that even assuming 
that the labor cases pending in the Court of Industrial Relations and the 
Supreme Court raise a prejudicial question, the complaint in question should not 
have been dismissed, but the hearing only suspended. </p>
<p>On the other hand, appellees in their brief maintain the correctness of the 
dismissal order and advance the counter arguments that (a) unlike American law, 
Philippine Labor Management Relations Statutes do not allow the recovery of 
damages even in illegal strikes, since R.A. 875 the Industrial Peace Act, limits 
liability in the case of illegal strike to dismissal of the employees 
participating therein and deprives their union of all the rights and privileges 
given by the law; and even in American law, damages are limited to 
jurisdictional strikes and secondary boycotts; (b) assuming arguendo at damages 
are recoverable, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, the 
plaintiff-appellant, has admitted voluntarily back to work most of the strikers 
and is therefore estopped from claiming damages from the defendant union because 
of such strike; (c) even assuming that damages are recoverable, there exists no 
cause of action because the question of strike legality is still to be 
determined; and that in the even that the orders of the Court of Industrial 
Relations are sustained, the plaintiff-appellant has not lost the right to 
prosecute for damages, assuming that damages are recoverable. </p>
<p>Appellant in its reply brief in refutation of the above counter arguments of 
appellees contended that (a) contrary to defendants' theory, Philippine law 
allows recovery of damages caused by the wrongful declaration and prosecution of 
a strike; and (b) that contrary to defendants' contention, plaintiff did not 
voluntarily admit the strikers back to work; hence, it cannot be estopped from 
claiming damages from defendants on account of their illegal and tortuous 
conduct. </p>
<p>A perusal of the records of this case however constrains US to resolve this 
appeal on the issue of the jurisdiction of the lower court, Court of First 
Instance, over the subject complaint for damages. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>1.&nbsp; It must be recalled that the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch 
XII initially refused to dismiss the complaint for damages of appellant as it 
was its view that it has jurisdiction over the same. It was only when appellees 
filed their motion for reconsideration on the ground that even assuming arguendo 
that the Court of First Instance has jurisdiction over the case, the cause of 
action has not yet accrued because the question of strike legality upon which 
depends the right of Philip­pine Long Distance Telephone Company to claim 
damages has yet to be decided as the same is still pending determination by the 
Court of Industrial Relations, that the above-mentioned Court of First Instance 
dismissed the complaint for damages -- on the ground that it was pre­maturely 
filed. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; WE rule that the regular courts, as herein Court of First Instance of 
Manila, Branch XII, have no juris­diction over complaints for damages of this 
nature. </p>
<p>Jurisprudence under R.A. 875, as amended, otherwise known as the Industrial 
Peace Act (which is now completely superseded by the New Labor Code) is settled 
that juris­diction over this kind of complaint for damages is exclusively lodged 
with the defunct Court of Industrial Relations and that the assumption and 
exercise of jurisdiction by the regular courts, Courts of First Instance, over 
the same, is a nullity. WE have declared that "x x x to rule that such demand 
for damages is to be passed upon by the regular courts of justice, instead of 
leaving the matter to the Court of Industrial Relations, 'would be to sanction 
split jurisdiction, which is prejudicial to the orderly adminis­tration of 
justice'" (Holganza vs. Apostol, 76 SCRA 191 [1977]). </p>
<p>Then Associate Justice, now incumbent Chief Justice, Enrique M. Fernando, in 
the aforesaid Holganza case collating the jurisprudence on the matter, stated... 
</p>
<p>"The jurisdictional issue, as noted, must be decided in favor of petitioners. 
There is this appraisal of the nature of the action instituted against them by 
private respondent, the Social Security System: 'Clearly, the complaint for 
damages is deeply rooted from the labor dispute certified by the President of 
the Philippines and from which resulted a collective bargaining agreement that 
was adopted as the court award. This award, in turn, branched out to disputes 
that led to the strike. On the basis of this strike, the SSS petitioned the CIR 
to declare the said strike illegal, to dis­miss the striking employees, and to 
declare the officers in contempt of court. And the claim for damages is the 
result of the strike. The SSS alleges that: '19. As a result of the Defendants' 
strike and picketing from September 3, 1968 to September 18, 1969, staged as 
aforesaid, in violation of the CIR award of August 5, 1966, as well as the 
orders of the CIR of August 29, 1966 and September 3 and September 5, 1968, 
plaintiff suffered actual and consequential damages...' (par. 19, Complaint, 
Annex 'A'; italics supplied). Likewise, in paragraphs 20 and 21 of the complaint 
the SSS seeks exemplary and moral damages in view of the defiance of the CIR 
orders and also because of the strike and picketing as thus alleged. In fine the 
alleged damages, the strike and picketing, the alluded CIR orders, the petition 
to declare the said strike illegal, to dismiss the striking employees, and to 
declare the officers in contempt of court -- are so intertwined and inseparable 
from each other. Except for the aspect of damages, all these incidents are 
embraced in CIR Case No. 46-IPA and which are still pending' (Ibid, Reasons and 
Authorities in Support of These Issues, 7-8). As far back as Associate Labor 
Union v. Gomez, L-25999, February 9, 1967, 19 SCRA 304, the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the Court of Industrial Relations in disputes of these character 
was upheld. 'To hold otherwise,' as succinctly stated by the ponente, Justice 
Sanchez, 'is to sanction split jurisdiction -- which is obnoxious to the orderly 
administration of justice' (Ibid, 309). Then in Progressive Labor Association v. 
Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corporation, L-27585, May 29, 1970, 33 
SCRA 349 decided three years later, Justice J.B.L. Reyes, speaking for the 
Court, stressed that to rule that such demand for damages is to be passed upon 
by the regular courts of justice, instead of leaving the matter to the Court of 
Industrial Relations, 'would be to sanction split jurisdiction, which is 
prejudicial to the orderly administra­tion of justice' (Ibid, 355). Thereafter, 
this Court, in the cases of Leoquenio v. Canada Dry Bottling Co., L-28621, 
February 22, 1971, 37 SCRA 535 and Associated Labor Union v. Cruz, L-28978, 
September 22, 1971, 41 SCRA 12, with the opinions coming from the same 
distinguished jurist, adhered to such a doctrine, the latest case in point, as 
noted at the outset, is the Goodrich Employees Association decision. The lack of 
jurisdiction of respondent Judge is thus manifest" (pp. 192-194). </p>
<p>And in Maria Cristina Fertilizer Plant Employees Association v. Tandayag, 
L-29217, May 11, 1978, 83 SCRA 56, 63, which in part also involved the question 
of whether the Court of First Instance can award damages arising from an alleged 
unfair labor practice, the Court's Second Division, through Justice Ramon C. 
Aquino, relying on the aforesaid case of Holganza and the cases therein cited, 
ruled in the negative and declared that the jurisdiction properly belonged to 
the Court of Industrial Relations; and consequently, reached the "x x x 
unavoidable conclusion that all the proceedings in Civil Case No. 1262 (of the 
Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte) are void for lack of jurisdiction" 
and "(T)hat case should be dismissed" (pp. 63-64). </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is clear from the records that the subject complaint for damages is 
intertwined with or deeply rooted from the 1964 certified labor dispute between 
appellant and appellees. As can be gleaned from the aforesaid complaint, 
appellant is claiming against appellees damages it allegedly sustained as a 
consequence of the strikes declared by the appellees. It is therefore obvious in 
the light of the established jurisprudence as aforestated that the lower court, 
Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XII, did not have jurisdiction over 
the aforesaid complaint for damages; hence, all the proceedings taken therein 
are void for lack of juris­diction. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The failure of the appellees to invoke anew the aforementioned solid 
ground of want of jurisdiction of the lower court in this appeal should not 
prevent this Tribunal to take up that issue as the lack of juris­diction of the 
lower court is apparent upon the face of the record and it is fundamental that a 
court of justice could only validly act upon a cause of action or subject matter 
of a case over which it has jurisdiction; and said jurisdiction is one conferred 
only by law; and cannot be acquired through, or waived by, any act or omission 
of the parties (Lagman v. CA, 44 SCRA 234 [1972]; hence, may be considered by 
this Court motu proprio (Gov't v. American Surety Co., 11 Phil. 203 [1908]). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, to decide either way, whether for appellant or for the appellees, 
without making a pronouncement on the fundamental point of jurisdiction, would 
not be conducive to the orderly administration of justice. For to sustain 
appellant's plea that the complaint for damages was not prematurely filed would 
result in the remanding of the case for further proceedings to the lower court 
which, as already indicated, has no jurisdiction over the same. On the other 
hand, if WE find for appellees, WE would be upholding an order premised on an 
erroneous legal assumption that the lower court has jurisdiction over the 
appellant's complaint for damages. </p>
<p>5.&nbsp; There is therefore no need to resolve the several issues raised by the 
contending parties in view of the above conclusions reached. </p></blockquote>
