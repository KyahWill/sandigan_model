the morning of </span>December 20, 1982, a Monday, complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Elvira Arias arrived at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City from </span><span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">as </span>she intended to take a
'special' boat trip from <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City to <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
when she went to the <span class="SpellE">Aboitiz</span> office, no more tickets
were available <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the special
trip which leaves in the morning of Tuesday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in </span>the afternoon, she took instead a
passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> bound for <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Leyte</span></span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp.

in the afternoon, she went to the house of her friend, <span class="SpellE">Si</span>
Hong, to look for <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Gucela</span>,
another friend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the latter was not
there, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">she </span>left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>letter for her at <span class="SpellE">Si</span> Hong's house (ibid, p. 32).</blockquote>

for the purpose of having her goiter 'prayed over', she, being a member of the
charismatic movement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, at <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30</st1:time> in the afternoon, she left <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>
for <span class="SpellE">Albuera</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,

at past <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening,
she hitched a ride in a truck owned by <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span>,

truck she was riding on took in five (5) teenagers including the appellant (<u>ibid</u>.,
pp. 33-40).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the truck's destination
was only up to the <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span> compound at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Ipil</span>, all the passengers
including the complainant and the appellant had to alight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four teenagers who were with the
appellant at <span class="SpellE">Talisayan</span> boarded a sugarcane hauling
truck bound for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename>

12.0pt">while </span>the appellant was left behind with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant approached </span>complainant and the latter, being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>stranger to the place, inquired
where <span class="SpellE">pedicabs</span> bound for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
were parked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant replied that it
was still some distance from the <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span>
compound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then asked her whether she
was new to the place and she said yes (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 6, <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1984</st1:date>; pp. 40-41, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="11">Nov. 24,
 1983</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant later
pointed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a certain </span>place so
they walked together towards the place where <span class="SpellE">pedicabs</span>
are stationed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While walking, they
passed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>railway track wherein
big tanks were at both sides of the track.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They also passed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>building
but still there was no sign of <span class="SpellE">pedicabs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a</span>gain
asked, 'where are the <span class="SpellE">pedicabs</span>?â€™.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He answered that it was still farther
off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">a </span>distance beyond a canal, appellant suddenly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">held her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As she resisted his advances, appellant boxed
and choked her dragging her to the nearby bushes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frightened out </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">her wits, she shouted for </span>help until
her throat nearly exploded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pleading for
her release, she offered him her wristwatch and told him that she had children
but her appeal fell on deaf ears (<u>ibid</u>, pp. 41-43, p. 49).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, she was boxed some more at different parts of her
body and was choked several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, she fell down several times and whenever she tried to stand <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">up, he would pull her back until her clothes
were </span>all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">muddy </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">(<u>ibid.</u>, </span>pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">48-49).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While he was choking her, she bit his hand but not too hard for fear
that he might kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also got
hold of his penis when his pants and underpants were already down and pulled it
to try and stop him from consummating his evil desires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But because of the blows on her head, chest,
and thighs and the heavy pressure on her neck due to the choking, she became
tired, weak and powerless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at
this juncture that he started to insert his penis inside her vagina.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the point of full penetration of appellant's penis, she
lapsed into unconsciousness and could not recall anything thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon regaining her senses, she found herself
lying down and her panties were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nowhere
to be found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fearing that the appellant
might get his companions, she got up and ran to the <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span>
compound where she </span>was met <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by a
guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She told the latter what happened

her to the police station to report the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having done so, and upon her own request, she
was taken to the <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> General Hospital for physical
examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medical finding of
"swollen (r) upper jaw" and "mucosal abrasion lower lip (L)
side" confirms the "heavy pressure on her neck due to choking by the
accused," which she had narrated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the physical examination, she went back to her cousin's house to
clean herself of the mud on her clothes, which act tallies with her testimony
that she fell down on the ground several times because the accused would pull
her back every time she tried to stand "until her clothes were all
muddy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Complainant's credibility
is further enhanced by the care she had exercised in her identification of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the line-up of suspects,
composed of her companions in the <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span> truck,
presented to her by the PC </span>on December 24, 1982, she pointed to no one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>her abuser <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">but instead gave a </span>more s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pecific
description of the culprit as the "smallest from among the </span>five
teenagers who boarded at <span class="SpellE">Talisayan</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">accused
was eventually arrested on July 6, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indubitably, therefore, complainant had sufficiently recognized her
assailant and could not have been mistaken as to </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">identity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">While the accused has
denied culpability, the fact remains that he partly corroborated complainant's
testimony when he said that on December 20, 1982 he, his companions and </span>a
"female <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">passenger," (who
could have been none other than complainant herein), rode together in </span>a <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Biophil</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> company truck; that upon reaching the <span class="SpellE">Biophil</span> compound, they all alighted; that the
"woman" asked him if there were still trips to <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span>
City; that he was, in fact, left behind </span>with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the "woman" as he was "not fast enough to overtake and
board" </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sugarcane hauling
truck with his companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
and in this he differs from complainant's version, he declared that "he
then left the woman, after she had an agreement with a truck </span>driver for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the latter to conduct her home".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We can give no credence
to this last statement, however, considering that it is most unlikely that he
would have shown even the remotest concern for a "woman" who was
unknown to him as he had testified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can we believe the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
declaration, corroborated by his witness, Mario Alba, that he had hitched a
ride on the latter's bicycle and had gone home soon after </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">companions did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these are belied by complainant's graphic
description of the manner </span>in which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
accused had tricked her, a </span>stranger to the place, into going to an
isolated area instead of leading her to the <span class="SpellE">pedicab</span>
parking space as she had requested, and after overpowering her, having carnal
knowledge of her by means of force and violence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record herein satisfies the Court, as it
did the Trial Court, that complainant's testimony, and not the denials by the
accused, is the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistencies and contradictions attributed to complainant
are <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>minimis</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is contended that in her affidavit
of December 28, 1982, she did not state that she had become unconscious when
the accused had carnal knowledge of her, while in her testimony she declared
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"she was </span>already
unconscious and did not have strength when <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
penis penetrated her vagina."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Ergo, it is claimed that since complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>unconscious she could not have testified as to penetration
or entry of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> private part, which is an
essential element of the crime of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, complainant's testimony on this point reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Q
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So in other words, you were conscious
when his penis entered your vagina, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was already very weak and I did
not have strength anymore and he was able to let his penis penetrate into my
vagina<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, because you were already tired,
you allowed the so-called push and pull movement in order that his penis will
penetrate to your vagina and his semen will come out, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A
-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was already unconscious during
that time and also because I was already very weak<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">.</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear then that although complainant was already weak and
powerless, she was still conscious as accused commenced the final act but that
she lapsed into unconsciousness at the point of full penetration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if so, lack of <span class="SpellE">conciousness</span> at
that point does not negate the commission of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As this Court has consistently held, full
penetration is not required.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is enough that there be proof of entrance of the male organ within the labia
the pudendum,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
or lips of the female organ.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The slightest penetration is sufficient to consummate the rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, complainant's testimony that there was
penetration was further corroborated by the medical finding that pelvic
examination of complainant readily admitted the index and middle finger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the examining physician testified, there
was possible penetration of a male organ in complainant's vaginal canal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The testimony had naturally to be couched in terms of possibility inasmuch as,
owing to the nature of the offense, more often than not, the only evidence is
the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged offended party,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
which should be proven impeccable in itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that this test has been successfully met.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's narration may have been
nebulous in scattered portions, which we find is also due to deficiencies in
the questions propounded, but this would not detract from its intrinsic value
nor from its basic credibility particularly on such crucial factors as the
identification of the accused and his culpability for the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> defense of denial and
alibi are too fragile to overcome the overwhelming evidence against him added
to the fact that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>himself
owned that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he was </span>in the
vicinity of the crime at the time of its commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED, with
the MODIFICATION that the indemnity payable by the accused to the complainant
is hereby increased to P20,000.00 in line with the latest jurisprudence.</p>
