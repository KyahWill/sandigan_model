respondent Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. CV No. 07064 affirming <i><span style="">in toto</span></i><span style=""> </span>the ruling of Branch IV of the then Court of First Instance
(now Regional Trial Court) of Lanao del Norte, at Iligan City, in Civil Case
No. 1076; the trial court found the petitioner to have encroached upon the
property of the private respondents to the extent of thirty-two (32) square
meters.  The petitioner was therefore
ordered to (a) vacate said portion, (b) deliver possession thereof to the
private respondents and (c) pay the sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The factual and procedural antecedents are summarized by the
respondent Court as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On October 24, 1978, Genoveva Nadayag, Felix Nadayag, Antipas
Nadayag, Andres Nadayag, Pedro Nadayag and Hilario Nadayag filed with the then
Court of First Instance of Lanao del Norte at Iligan City, Branch II, a
complaint against Maria Gulang and/or Pedro Lasmarias.  It is alleged in the complaint that
plaintiffs are co-owners of a parcel of land located in Port Area, Iligan City,
62 square meters in area, covered by Tax Declaration No. 76-18851 and TCT No.
T-15334; that defendant Maria Gulang is the registered owner of a parcel of
land, also located at Port Area, Iligan City, with an area of 40 square meters,
covered by Tax Declaration No. 76-281591 and TCT No. T-12999; that before Maria
Gulang acquired the abovementioned lot, <span style="">she
rented a portion of the </span>same,<i> </i><span style="">32 square meters in area, together with the improvements thereon from
defendant Pedro Lasmarias; that sometime in 1964, Pedro Lasmarias purchased
from the plaintiffs' predecessor-in-interest a parcel of land, 38.5 square
meters in area, adjacent to the aforementioned 62 square meters lot of the
plaintiffs; that plaintiffs had complained </span>against Maria <span style="">Gulang's occupancy of the above-said 32
square-meters-area in plaintiffs’ 62 square-meters-parcel of land, the rentals
on which (the 32 square meters-portion and the house erected thereon) Maria
Gulang had been paying to Pedro Lasmarias instead of to the plaintiffs; and
that Pedro Lasmarias has been claiming that the 32 square-meters-portion is
part and parcel of his land which he purchased from plaintiffs'
predecessor-in-interest.  Plaintiffs
pray that Maria Gulang be ordered to vacate the 32 square-meters-portion of
plaintiffs' land and restore possession and/or ownership thereof to plaintiffs;
and that defendants be ordered to pay back rentals on the said portion for </span>a
<span style="">period of twelve (12) years from 1966
at the rate of P100.00 per month; moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees
and costs of litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In their Answer, filed on November 6, 1978, defendants deny the
claim of the plaintiffs and by way of affirmative and special defenses alleged
that the defendants are the ‘true, legal and lawful owner (sic) and in actual
possession and occupation’ of the land in question, as evidenced by the<span style=""> </span>original certificate of title in the
name of defendant Pedro Lasmarias and the transfer certificate of title in the
name of defendant Maria Gulang, describing the property involved as ‘Forty (40)
meters, more or less’.  By way of
counterclaim, defendants seek moral damages <span style="">and exemplary damages and attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The pre-trial was then set and held, during which the parties came
to an agreement to have the two lots in question relocated by surveyors who
shall jointly conduct the relocation <span style="">survey.  </span>However, the survey was not conducted
because of the failure of the <span style="">two </span>surveyors
to jointly make the survey.  Instead, a
separate survey was made by a surveyor of the Bureau of Lands, Sr. Geodetic
Engineer Norberto Carreon, Land District No. XII-2, Iligan City, who conducted
the survey in September 1979, in the presence of both parties who indicated to
the said surveyor the extents of their respective occupancies on the l<span style="">ands being surveyed.  Said surveyor's report contains the
following conclusion:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘On the actual observations based upon my relocation survey, Maria
Gulang, the herein defendant is occupying a portion of Lot No. 6094, Cad. 292,
covered by TCT No. T-15314 issued to Genoviva (sic) Nadayag as<span style=""> indicated in the hereto (sic) attached
sketch plan shaded in black with an area of 30 square meters.’</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>But defendants' counsel made an open court
manifestation that his clients will not abide with (sic) the abovesaid survey
and report.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On February 2, 1981, defendant Pedro Lasmarias filed a motion to
admit his amended answer, attaching thereto the Amended Answer in which the
defenses of want of cause of action, prescription, estoppel, laches and fraud
were introduced.  And on February 6,
1981, defendant Maria Gulang filed a similar motion to admit her amended
answer, likewise attaching to the motion her Amended Answer in<span style=""> which the same defenses as those introduced
in defendant Lasmarias’ Amended Answer, abovementioned, were similarly
raised.  These motions were denied by
the court in its Order of September 27, 1981.  Again in a resolution dated June 1, 1983, the trial court denied the
motion </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">reconsideration of the abovementioned order
denying defendants’ motion for the admission of their amended answers.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After trial, the lower court found that ‘there is undoubtedly an
area of 32 sq. meters in the land of the plaintiffs encroached upon by the
defendant Maria Gulang, [and] this should be returned to the plaintiffs’; and
accordingly rendered judgment ordering the defendant Maria Gulang to vacate the
said area and to deliver possession thereof to the plaintiffs, and to pay the
sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees; and dismissing all other claims and
counterclaims for lack of merit and insufficiency of evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendant Maria Gulang elevated the abovesaid decision to the then
Intermediate Appellate Court on appeal.  And plaintiffs likewise appealed that portion of the decision concerning
the ‘none (sic) award of rentals and reasonable use of the property only’.  Plaintiffs' appeal was however dismissed by
the then Intermediate Appellate Court for failure to file appellants' brief."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In her Brief filed with the <span style="">respondent
</span>Court, petitioner submitted the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>“1.  The honorable court erred in denying
defendant Pedro Lasmarias’ motion to amend answer as predecessor in interest of
defendant-appellant Maria Gulang to plaintiff's complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  <span style="">The
lower court erred in not holding that plaintiff's action has long prescribed;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  The lower court erred in not holding that
plaintiffs are estopped from denying the existence of the contract of purchase
of the land and house in question by defendant Pedro Lasmarias which land and
house was (sic) subsequently sold to defendant Maria Gulang (Exh.
"1", Lasmarias and Exh. "2", Gulang);</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  The lower court erred in not holding that
plaintiff's (sic) complaint should be dismissed on grounds (sic) of laches;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  The lower court erred in holding that
defendant Maria Gulang encroached on 32 square meters of the land of the
plaintiffs and ordering her to vacate the same and in not holding that the
title of the plaintiffs over the land in question was acquired thru fraudulent
means; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  The lower court erred
in ordering defendant Maria Gulang to pay attorney's fee (sic) of
P2,000.00."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of these assigned errors, respondent Court ruled
that the trial court correctly denied defendant Lasmarias' motion to amend the
answer pursuant to Section 3, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court considering that
the same was filed after the case had been set for hearing and that it
substantially altered his defense by adding the grounds of prescription,
estoppel, laches and fraud; accordingly, since the second to the fifth assigned
errors raise precisely these defenses in <span style="">issue,
</span>they are thus deemed raised for the first time in the appeal.  Pursuant therefore to Section 2, Rule 9 of the
Rules of Court, these defenses are deemed waived.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court further declared that the main issue in the
case "is <u>whether</u> <u>or</u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>defendants</u> <u><span style="">had</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>encroached</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>land</u> <u>of</u><span style=""> <u>the</u> <u>p</u></span><u>laintiffs</u>."
It then concluded that "the trial court made a proper assessment" of
the evidence in relation to the pertinent law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner reiterates the above assignment of errors in this
petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution of 8 November 1989, <span style="">this </span>Court gave due course to the petition<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
required the parties to submit their respective Memoranda.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Deliberating on the pleadings of the parties, We find no merit in
this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the ruling of the respondent Court on the first assigned
error, it is worth noting that petitioner and defendant Pedro Lasmarias
originally filed, on 6 November 1978, a common Answer through Atty. Luis
Buendia.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On 2 February 1981, <span style="">through </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">new counsel, Atty. </span><span style="">Moises
Dalisay, Jr., </span><span style="">defendant
Lasmarias filed for himself a motion to amend the </span><span style="">answe</span><span style="">r;</span><span style=""> the </span><span style="">proposed Amended Answer</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> was attached thereto.  It is thus clear that petitioner neither
joined her co-defendant nor was included as a party in the motion to amend the
answer and the amended answer itself.  Neither
does she claim in any of her pleadings that the motion and amended answer were
further amended to include her as a party thereto or that she adopted the same
as her own.  Petitioner, therefore,
cannot benefit from Lasmarias' action, which ultimately failed, or revive the
same after the latter unilaterally and voluntarily abandoned it by failing to
appeal from the decision.  That
petitioner is a successor-in-interest of Lasmarias with respect to the property
acquired by the latter from private respondent Genoveva Nadayag and therefore,
was indirectly benefited by the filing of both the motion and the proposed
amended complaint, does not improve her position because even if it were so,
such defenses were deemed waived by Lasmarias' failure to allege the same in
the Answer and exercise his right under Section 2, Rule 10 of the Rules of
Court.  Section 5, Rule 16; Section 2,
Rule 9; and Section 2, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court easily come into focus.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of Rule 16 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 5.  </span><i>Pleading grounds as affirmative </i><i><span style="">defenses.  -- </span></i>Any of the grounds for dismissal provided for in this
rule, except improper venue, may be pleaded as an affirmative defense, and a
preliminary hearing may be had thereon as if a motion to dismiss had been
filed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Rule 9 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.  <i><span style="">Defenses<b> </b>and objections not pleaded
deemed waived</span></i><span style="">.  -- </span>Defenses and objections not
pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived except
the <span style="">failure </span>to state a cause of
action which may be alleged in a later pleading, if one is permitted, or by
motion for judgment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits; but in the
last instance, the motion shall be disposed of as provided in section 5 of Rule
10 in the light of any evidence which may have been received.  Whenever it appears that the court has no
jurisdiction over the subject matter, it shall dismiss the action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And Section 2 of Rule 10 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.  <i>When </i><i><span style="">amendments allowed as a matter of right</span></i><span style="">.  -- </span>A
party may amend his pleading once as a matter of course at any time before a
responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one to which no responsive
pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed upon the trial
calendar, he may so amend it at any time within ten (10) days after it is
served."<i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the motion to amend was filed long after the
pre-trial was terminated and the case placed on the trial calendar.  If Lasmarias failed to take any positive
action to amend his answer before pre-trial, he should have raised during the
pre-trial itself, which was conducted much later, his other possible defenses
and, accordingly, amend his answer for that purpose.  One of the avowed purposes for the holding of a pre-trial as
provided under Section 1, Rule 20 of the Rules of Court, is precisely to
consider "the <span style="">necessity </span>or <span style="">desirability of </span>amendments to the <span style="">pleadings."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing rules are not, however, iron-clad.  Under Section 3 of Rule 10, substantial
amendments may be made even after the case has been set for hearing provided
prior leave of court is obtained.  Such
leave may be refused if the motion requesting for the same would delay the
action or the cause of action or defense would be substantially altered by the
proposed amendment.  This rule was
correctly applied by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As could be gleaned from Section 2 of Rule 9, two (2) defenses
are not deemed waived by the failure to raise them in <span style="">a </span>motion to dismiss or in the answer, to wit:  (a) lack of cause of action and lack of jurisdiction
on the part of the Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lack of cause of action may thus be raised in a motion to dismiss
after the answer has been filed, by a motion for judgment on the pleadings, or
at the trial on the <span style="">merits.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As to </span>jurisdiction,
while it is true that jurisdiction over the subject matter of a case may be
raised at any stage of the proceedings as the same is conferred by law,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
it is nevertheless settled that a party may be barred from raising it on the
ground of laches or estoppel.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is also authority to the effect that the defense of
prescription is not deemed waived, <span style="">even
</span>if not pleaded in a motion to dismiss or in the answer, if plaintiff's
allegation in the complaint or the evidence he presents shows clearly that the
action has prescribed.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not petitioner had encroached upon the lot of
private respondents, We see no reason to disturb the findings of the trial
court on this matter which were subsequently affirmed by the respondent Court
of Appeals; such findings are supported by the evidence.  The relocation survey conducted by Senior
Geodetic Engineer Norberto Carreon of the Bureau of Lands, prepared in the
presence of both parties who indicated to him the extent of their
"respective occupancies", discloses that the petitioner "is occupying
a portion of Lot No. 6094, Cad. 292, covered by TCT No. T-15314 issued to
Genoviva (sic) Nadayag as indicated in the hereto (sic) attached sketch plan
shaded in black with an area of 30 square meters."</p>
