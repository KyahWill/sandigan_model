				<BR><STRONG>CORTES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Brothers Rodrigo and Ernesto Ruiz (private respondents herein)
entered into individual agency agreements with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
in 1977, each starting out as trainee-agents and later promoted to higher
positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1981</st1:date>, Ernesto was designated as district
manager under <span style="">a </span>three-year
Agreement of <span class="SpellE">Managership</span> [Annex “A”, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 34.] However, he was dismissed from service on
November 30, 1983, before the lapse of the period fixed in the contract, when
upon audit he was found to have delayed the remittance of premium collections
in his possession and to have appropriated for his own use the sum of Twelve
Thousand Eight Hundred Eighteen Pesos and Seventy-Three Centavos (P12,818.73)
by remitting smaller amounts of premiums than that actually paid by policy
holders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
then designated Rodrigo as officer-in charge to take over the functions of
district manager in the <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> district effective <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1983</st1:date>, in addition to his
responsibilities then as zone supervisor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, Rodrigo proved to be made of the same stuff as his
brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his designation as
officer-in-charge was recalled in January 1984, he instigated the other zone
supervisors and debit agents of the <span class="SpellE">Butuan</span> district
not to submit their weekly reports of business and not to remit the premium
collections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodrigo’s insistent
violation despite warnings from the Vice-President for <span class="SpellE">VisMin</span>
Sales prompted <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> to terminate his employment
effective <st1:date year="1984" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1984</st1:date> in a
letter dated <st1:date year="1984" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the ground for Rodrigo’s dismissal
was not given in said letter, petitioner maintained that it was for
substantially the same infractions committed by Ernesto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the consolidated illegal dismissal cases (NLRC RAB X Case Nos.
4-0210-84 and 2-0103-85) filed by the brothers, the labor arbiter found that
Rodrigo and Ernesto:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) were <u>employees</u>
of <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>; (2) committed acts inimical to <span class="SpellE">Grepalife’s</span> business; and (3) were dismissed without first
being afforded due process by way of a notice in writing of the grounds for their
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, despite such findings, the labor arbiter ordered their
reinstatement without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 51-52.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal, the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)
affirmed the factual findings of the labor arbiter but reversed the order of
reinstatement on the ground that <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> cannot be
compelled to retain an employee found guilty of acts inimical to its
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, “separation pay”
was awarded in favor of private respondents for petitioner’s failure to observe
due process prior to their termination from employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>. . . for failure of respondents [<span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
and the branch manager] to give timely notice in writing to complainants of the
acts constituting the grounds for their dismissal pursuant to Section 2, Rule
XIV, of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
130, respondent should be ordered to pay complainants Rodrigo Ruiz and Ernesto
Ruiz <u>separation</u> <u>pay</u>, equivalent to one-half month’s salary for
every year of service.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>[NLRC Resolution, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 9; Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General filed its comment on behalf of public
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed a reply
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the Court
resolved to give the petition due course and to require the parties to submit
their memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and public
respondent complied and duly submitted their respective memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, private respondents did
not file their comment and memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The existence of valid grounds for private respondents’ dismissal
is not disputed herein, and therefore the finding that the Ruiz brothers were
dismissed for just cause is final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
only issues in this petition are (1) Whether or not there was grave abuse of
discretion on the part of public respondent in holding that Ernesto and Rodrigo
are employees of <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>; and (2) Whether or not
there was grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent in
ordering the award of separation pay to private respondents as sanction for <span class="SpellE">Grepalife’s</span> failure to accord them due process even though
there <span style="">was </span>finding of just cause
for their dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the first issue, the Court finds no grave abuse
of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> contends that Rodrigo and
Ernesto are <u>agents</u>, not employees, of the company by alleging that they
were hired under <u>agency</u> <u>agreements</u>, that they were not among the
company’s “organic personnel” who handled technical and administrative
functions of the company, that they were paid on the basis of production/output
(by way of commissions and bonuses, and not salaries), and that they were
neither under any form of control whatsoever as to hours of work nor were they
“on call” by the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis
of the foregoing, <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> concluded that the
relationship was one of principal-agent and therefore, necessarily, it is the
Civil Code and the Insurance Code which properly govern the relationship, to
the exclusion of the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 280 of the Labor Code provides that “[t]he provisions of
written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral
agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where
the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary
or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer. . . .”
Furthermore, in determining who is considered an “employee”, the Court has time
and again applied the “four-fold” test,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> with <u>control</u>
being the most crucial and determinative indicator of an employer-employee
relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The “employer” must have
control (or must have reserved the right to control) not only over the result
of the “employee’s” work but also the means and methods by which it is to be
accomplished [Investment Planning Corp. of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

 7, 1987</st1:date>, 147 SCRA 49; <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span> v. NLRC,
G.R. No. 73887, <st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1989</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above, the Court finds that, <span style="">as </span>correctly held by public
respondent, the relationships of the Ruiz brothers and <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
were those of employer-employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, their work at the time of their dismissal as zone
supervisor and district manager are necessary and desirable to the usual
business of the insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were entrusted with supervisory, sales and other functions to guard <span class="SpellE">Grepalife’s</span> business interests and to bring in more clients
to the company, and even with administrative functions to ensure that all
collections, reports and data are faithfully brought to the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it cannot be gainsaid that <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
had control over private respondents’ performance as well as the result of
their efforts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cursory reading of
their respective functions as enumerated in their contracts reveals that the
company practically dictates the manner by which their jobs are to be carried
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the District Manager
must properly account, record and document the company’s funds, spot-check and
audit the work of the zone supervisors, conserve the company’s business in the
district through “reinstatements”, follow up the submission of weekly
remittance reports of the debit agents and zone supervisors, preserve company
property in good condition, train understudies for the position of district
manager, and maintain his quota of sales (the failure of which is a ground for
termination).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, a zone
supervisor must direct and supervise the sales activities of the debit agents
under him, conserve company property through “reinstatements”, undertake and
discharge the functions of absentee debit agents, spot-check the records of
debit agents, and insure proper documentation of sales and collections by the
debit agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, it cannot be denied that based on the definition of an
“insurance agent” in the Insurance Code [Art. 300] some of the functions
performed by private respondents were those of insurance agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it does not follow that they
are not employees of <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Insurance Code may govern the licensing
requirements and other particular duties of insurance agents, but it does not
bar the application of the Labor Code with regard to labor standards and labor
relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is well-settled that the existence of an
employer-employee relationship is ultimately a question of fact, and such
findings of fact of the labor arbiter and the NLRC shall be accorded not only
respect but even finality when supported by substantial evidence [RJL Martinez
Fishing Corporation v. NLRC, G.R. Nos. 63550-51, January 31, 1984, 127 SCRA
454; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Asim</span></span><span style=""> </span>v. Castro, G.R. Nos. 75063-64, June
30, 1988, 163 SCRA 344; Murillo v. Sun Valley Realty, Inc., G.R. No. 67272,
June 30, 1988, 163 SCRA 271,) as in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second issue, petitioner argues that private
respondents are not entitled to separation pay since there was clear finding of
just cause for dismissal, and furthermore “neither the law nor the rules
implementing the same authorizes the award of separation pay as ‘penalty’.”
[Petition, p. 8; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 25.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the contention is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be emphasized that the monetary award fixed by public
respondent, although erroneously termed as “separation pay”, <span style="">was </span>in fact a <u>sanction</u> for the
employer’s failure to observe the procedural requirements of due process
provided under Rule XIV, <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 2, 5 and 6 of the
rules implementing Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
130, and the parties’ own covenant (Annex “A”, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 38.] The imposition of such a sanction is in consonance with the ruling in
the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Wenphil</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>NLRC</u>,
G.R. No. 80587, <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1989</st1:date>,
170 SCRA <span style="">69.) </span>The Court held
therein that an <u>indemnity</u>, not “separation pay”, must be imposed on the
employer for failure to observe the procedural requirements of notice and
hearing prior to the dismissal of an employee for just cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the circumstances of the case at
bar, petitioner must indemnify private respondents in the amount of One
Thousand Pesos (P1, 000.00) each [<u>See</u> <u>also</u> <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>,
Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 74229, <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1989</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW OF THE
FOREGOING</span></b><span style="">, </span>the
decision of the NLRC is hereby <span style="">MODIFIED </span>insofar
as the award of “separation pay” is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In lieu of “separation pay” petitioner <span class="SpellE">Grepalife</span>
