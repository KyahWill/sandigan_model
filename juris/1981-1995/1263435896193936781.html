Having failed to submit counter-affidavits despite the favorable action on his

<p class="BODY">The conviction is based on the evidence duly established by the
prosecution and summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of March 4, 1991, a police team composed of
P01 Leo Letrodo of the NARCOM, 8th Narcotics Regional District, Tacloban City,
P02 Elpidio Digdigan and P02 Porferio Mañoso, the latter two of the 361st PNP
Company, Camp Lukban, Catbalogan, Samar, with the participation of a female
confidential informant, conducted a 'buy-bust' operation in Ubanon District, in
this capital town of Catbalogan, with herein accused Bobby de Paz as the
target-suspect, and Letrodo acting as poseur-buyer.  Letrodo, Digdigan and Mañoso went to Brgy. 9, Ubanon District at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">around 5:30 pm.  In Ubanon, Letrodo made contact with the confidential agent and
the latter in turn contacted the accused.  Near an area where dried fish are sold, the confidential agent
introduced Letrodo to the accused de Paz as one from Tacloban City who wanted
to buy marijuana from said accused.  Digdigan and Mañoso positioned themselves around 10 meters away from,
and in full view of Letrodo, the accused and the confidential agent.  Letrodo asked accused (sic) how much was the
price of the drug and the latter informed the former that three (3) sticks of
marijuana cigarettes cost P10.00.  Letrodo then informed the accused that if the latter had some available
marijuana, the former wanted to buy P50.00-worth of the drug.  Letrodo then handed to accused de Paz a
marked P50.00 bill (Exh. "A") which accused placed in his pocket
after which accused left the place.  A
few minutes later, the accused came back and handed to Letrodo fifteen (15)
rolled up sticks of marijuana cigarettes.  Upon receiving the sticks of marijuana cigarettes, Letrodo opened one of
the sticks, and after determining by its smell that it indeed contained
marijuana, the lawman scratched his head as a signal to Digdigan and Mañoso who
immediately approached Letrodo.  Letrodo
introduced himself as a NARCOM agent and apprehended the accused.  Digdigan and Mañoso likewise introduced
themselves to the accused.  Letrodo
searched de Paz's pocket and got from it the marked P50.00 bill (Exh. "A")
he had earlier given said accused.  Letrodo and his companions then brought the accused to the headquarters
of the 361st PNP Company for investigation.  The fifteen (15) sticks of suspected marijuana cigarettes were later
submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory Service, RUC 8, Camp September 21st Movement,
PNP Hills, Palo, Leyte, where they were subjected to qualitative examination
and found positive for marijuana, a prohibited drug.”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the trial court's summary of the evidence for
the defense is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At around 6:30 p.m. of March 4, 1991, accused Bobby de Paz
was in the grocery store of Victoria Cordova in front of the church in Ubanon
District when three men whose identities were then unknown to him but whom he
now knows to be Sgt. Digdigan, SPO2 Mañoso and a certain Captain Marcelo,
approached him asking where they could buy some dried fish.  Accused led the three men to another store
of Victoria Cordova where dried fish were sold, but finding there the price of
dried fish to be high, the three men, together with the accused, went to the
nearby store of Fidel Gaditano, where they bought a kilo of dried fish.  Accused and the three men then went out of
Gaditano's store and parted ways.  Accused then proceeded on his way to the warehouse (‘casa') where he was
working, but before he could reach the place, he was called by one Emma
Alcantara who was near the gate of the church.  When accused approached Alcantara, the latter requested him to buy for
her some marijuana from a certain Frankie Dacallos.  Accused begged off and asked Alcantara to go to Dacallos herself
as she was known to him.  Alcantara
reiterated her request and so he got the P50.00 from the former and went to the
house of Dacallos nearby to buy marijuana.  Accused failed to buy marijuana from Dacallos as he had none of the
stuff at the time.  When accused went
back to Alcantara, the latter requested him to buy marijuana instead from one
'Taba', whose real name is Renato Albat.  Accused told Alcantara that he would take a bath first, but because
Alcantara requested him to do her the favor as it would not take long anyway,
accused proceeded to the house of Taba which is very near where Alcantara was
at the time.  In the house of Taba
accused bought P50.00 worth of marijuana which Taba handed to him wrapped in a
newspaper.  Accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">then went to Alcantara and gave her the
marijuana he had bought from Taba.  After the two parted ways, accused proceeded on his way to the place
where he was working, but after he had taken five steps, he heard a gun report.  As accused quickened his steps, P02 Mañoso
put his arm around the shoulders of the former, telling him not to run so
nothing would happen to him, and to go with him (Mañoso) towards the (sic)
downtown.  Mañoso took the accused to a
Petron gasoline station followed by the former's two companions in buying the
dried fish earlier.  At the gasoline
station, accused was made to board a motor vehicle, and shortly after the
vehicle's engine had started, Emma Alcantara arrived and handed to Captain
Marcelo the wrapped marijuana accused had earlier purchased for Alcantara from
Taba.  The lawmen then brought the
accused to the PNP Headquarters in Camp Lukban, Brgy. Maulong, also of this
capital town.   Accused was brought to
the office of Captain Marcelo, and upon being asked from whom he bought the
marijuana, told the officer that he bought them from Renato Albat.  Captain Marcelo then ordered Mañoso to bring
the accused to Sgt. Digdigan."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The court <i>a quo</i> gave full faith and credit to the
prosecution's evidence as the witnesses who took part in the buy-bust operation
are police officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a
regular manner; moreover, nothing in the record suggests any reason or motive
as to why they would testify falsely against the accused.  The court, however, rejected the accused's
version not only because his testimony was uncorroborated, but also because he
admitted possessing the fifteen sticks of marijuana cigarettes before the same
were seized by the law enforcers.  Furthermore, "[T]he evidence shows that for a period before the
'buy-bust' operation was actually conducted, the police placed the accused
under surveillance, convincing the lawmen that accused was engaged in the
illicit and highly pernicious practice or business of 'drug-pushing';
specifically, of selling marijuana to interested or willing customers or
buyers.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first error, the accused maintains that the evidence
relied on to convict him clearly indicates the presence of instigation which
would entitle him to an acquittal considering that instigation is an absolutory
cause akin to an exempting circumstance in criminal law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
According to him, the idea to purchase marijuana did not come from him; he
claims that it originated from Emma Alcantara, the alleged confidential
informant and "asset" of the police officers.  Nor could he be prosecuted for illegal
possession under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6425 as he had no intention to possess
the marijuana at all; he merely ran an errand for Alcantara.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the second assigned error, the accused contends
that the version submitted by the prosecution "is in fact not
corroborated, full of glaring contradictions and material inconsistencies,
absurd and concocted situations." He argues that the evidence on the
illegal transaction is anchored solely on the testimony of PO1 Letrodo, which
was uncorroborated.  Hence, the same
should not be given weight and credence as doubt exists as to whether the
accused really sold the merchandise to the latter; the accused contends that
the doubt should be resolved in his favor.  More importantly, he claims that the said police officer had a sinister
motive for testifying falsely against him.  The accused avers that he was merely being used to flush out the drug
pushers in the locality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The primordial issue in this case is factual and involves the
credibility of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is doctrinally settled that when the issue of the credibility
of witnesses is involved, appellate courts will generally not disturb the
findings of the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better
position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying during trial, unless certain facts or circumstance
of weight have been overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied which, if
considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Having reviewed the records of this case and evaluated the evidence of both
parties, we find no compelling reason to depart from the factual findings of
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have likewise consistently held in several drugs cases that
absent any proof to the contrary, law enforcers are presumed to have regularly
performed their duty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, aside from the accused's bare allegation of a sinister
motive on the part of the law enforcers to use him "to flush out the drug
pushers in Ubanon District, Catbalogan, Samar, particularly the suspected drug
dealers, Frankie Dacallos and Renato Albat,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
no other evidence was introduced to rebut the presumption of regularity.  The allegation of a sinister motive is at
once self-serving and baseless because the fact of the matter is that the
accused had been under surveillance precisely for drug pushing.  It is, therefore, unlikely that he would be
used at all to flush out the drug pushers in Ubanon District.</p>

<p class="BODY">We thus find no merit in the accused's claim that he was
instigated, not entrapped and, therefore, should be absolved since instigation
“is an absolutory cause or akin to an exempting circumstance.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
As incontrovertibly disclosed by the evidence for the prosecution, a buy-bust
operation -- with PO1 Leo Letrodo as the poseur-buyer -- was successfully
carried out in this case.  Letrodo, after
contacting the accused, offered to buy sticks of marijuana cigarettes from him;
the latter then accepted.  Consequently,
Letrodo handed the marked P50.00 bill to the accused who then left and returned
a few minutes later to deliver the fifteen sticks of marijuana cigarettes.  Letrodo opened up one stick and, after
determining that it contained marijuana, gave the pre-arranged signal to his
teammates who swooped down on the accused.  Clearly, the accused was caught <i>in flagrante</i>.  The operation, a definite entrapment, was
hatched to expose, arrest and prosecute the accused, a drug trafficker.  Since he was actually committing a crime, no
one else was needed to induce him to consummate his evil intentions.  In short, the criminal intent did not
originate from Letrodo, but from the accused himself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Entrapment has consistently proven to be an effective method of apprehending
drug peddlers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, as well, no merit in the second assigned error as
Letrodo's testimony is not uncorroborated.  On the contrary, the said testimony was in fact corroborated by the
testimonies of the other policemen who were present during the buy-bust
operation.  Besides, even if there was
no corroboration, the testimony is credible by itself and would require no
further avouchment.  We have ruled that
the testimony of a single witness, if credible, is sufficient to convict.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the accused has practically admitted that he was caught in
possession of fifteen sticks of marijuana cigarettes, he still argues that he
was merely acting as an errand boy for the police informer.  We are not persuaded.  The fact that he had the prohibited drug
with him and accepted the P50.00 as payment for it clearly established a consummated
sale of the illegal drug which is punishable under Section 4, Article II of the
Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972, as amended.  Section 4 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4. <i>Sale, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and
Transportation of Prohibited Drugs.</i> -- The penalty of life imprisonment to
death and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be
imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, administer,
deliver, give away to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any
prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.  If the victim of the offense is a minor, or
should a prohibited drug involved in any offense under this Section be the
proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the maximum penalty herein
provided <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">shall be imposed." (As
amended by P.D. No. 1675, 17 February 1980.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The law does not require the element of
intent to sell or possess in order to obtain a conviction.  Nor is it essential that the ownership of
the prohibited drug be established or known.  The commission of the offense of illegal sale of marijuana requires
merely the consummation of the selling transaction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

As has been proven and established by clear and convincing evidence, the
accused committed the said unlawful act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the challenged decision is in accordance with the facts and
the law.</p>
