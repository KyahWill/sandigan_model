				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">That the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the
accused has not been satisfactorily overcome by the prosecution evidence in the
case at bar where the conviction of petitioner for falsification of public
documents was based principally on the mere assumption that as possessor of the
falsified documents, he is pre­sumed to be the author of the falsification, is
stoutly raised in this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since there is no direct proof showing that
accused-appellant, being then the Provincial Plant Industry Officer with many
subordinate employees and personnel under him engaged in agricultural field
work and assigned in the rural areas like the com­plainant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>, had personally and actually falsified the public
documents in question (<span class="SpellE">Timebook</span> and Payroll, Exhibit
"A"; Daily Time Record, Exhibit "B"; and Certification, Exhibit
"C") which under normal office pro­cedures pass through numerous
hands at several government offices for typing, attestations, funding,
accounting, and payment of the check for P225.00, the legal issue thus raised
merits Our careful consideration and resolution, in the face of
accused-appellant's vigorous denial.</p>

crime of FALSIFICATION OF PUBLIC DOCUMENT committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the period from January, February and March,
1977, and sometime thereafter, in the Municipality of San Fernando, Province of
La Union, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, being then the Provincial Plant Industry Officer of Bureau
of Plant Industry, Provincial Office at San Fernando, La Union and in relation
by his performance of the duties of his office, taking advantage of his
position as such, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
falsify the <span class="SpellE">Timebook</span> and Payroll of his office for
the periods January to March, 1977, Daily Time Record for the same period of
Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> and Certification for P225.00 by
causing it to appear in the said documents that Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
have parti­cipated in the same and affixed his signa­tures thereon when in
truth and in fact he did not so sign the said documents nor otherwise
participated in their execution to the damage and prejudice of the said Rodrigo

the trial commenced on August 7, 1980 after the case was reinvestigated by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> on petition of said accused-appellant, herein
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1980</st1:date>,
the respondent court rendered a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1980</st1:date>, finding the petitioner guilty
as per the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from recites the evidence for the
government as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The gist of the evidence of the pro­secution, which consist
of the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span>
Olivares, 43 years old, married, agronomist and Provincial Plant Officer,
Manuel <span class="SpellE">Varquez</span>, 45 years old, married and Regional
Director and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Lorenzo, 47 years old, married
and Cashier, all of the Bureau of Plant Industry in San Fernando, La Union,
shows that <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was employed as Plant Pest Officer
with the Bureau of Plant Industry stationed in San Fernando, La Union from
February 2, 1975 up to his resignation on April 30, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="2">February
 2, 1975</st1:date> up to December 1976, he was detailed as production
technician in the Program of the Bureau of Plant Industry and the Bureau of
Agricultural Extension receiving incentive pay from the National Food and
Agricultural Council (NFAC) during said period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1977, how­ever, <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was no longer
entitled to the NFAC incentive pay as he was detailed to the Surveillance Team
of the Bureau of Plant Industry from January 1977 up to <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1978</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before one can receive his NFAC in­centive pay, he must
prepare his Daily Time Record (CS Form 48) for the month and a certification
that he is detailed with the Program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
February 1978, <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was informed by one Roberto
Castro that he is supposed to receive NFAC incentive pay because his name is
included in the special order enumerating those included in the program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
to go to the Accounting Division of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Region I in <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La Union to verify the information relayed
to him by Castro and there he discovered that in the payroll for January,
February and March 1977 (Exhibit A) his name and signature appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to said pay­roll were a
certification that he was detailed to the Program (Exhibit C) and the
corresponding Daily Time Records for said months (Exhibit D) which appeared to
have been all signed by <span class="GramE">him.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Actually, however, he did not sign the said
payroll, certification and time records nor did he authorize anybody to sign
for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
referred the aforesaid falsification to the accused in the last week of
February 1978 and accused, confessing to him that he got the money, repeatedly
offered him Two Hundred Twenty Five (P225.00) Pesos to cover his incentive pay
but he remained silent and refused to receive the amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He finally brought the matter to Regional
Director Manuel <span class="SpellE">Varquez</span> who assigned Olivares to
investigate the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But inasmuch as no
further action was taken, he brought the case to the attention of the President
and the Director of the Bureau of Plant Industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> likewise
submitted his written re­signation to the Regional Director (Exhibit E) on
April 28, 1978 because he felt 'utterly' demoralized because of undesi­rable
actuations which he recently disco­vered x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="5">May
 18, 1978</st1:date>, he received a reply from Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Varquez</span> dated <st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="5">May
 15, 1978</st1:date> (Exhibit F) stating that his aforesaid letter of
resignation had been endorsed to the accused and attached there­with was the
reply of the latter (Exhibit F-1)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the decision condensed the evidence of the defense in
the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, accused, in brief, claimed that <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was one of those involved in the Program for the
months of January, February and March 1977 as shown in Special Order No. 172 of
the Bureau of Plant Industry Director Domingo E. <span class="SpellE">Panga­niban</span>
(Exhibits 6 and 6-A) and actually paid of his incentive pay and that it is not
true that he received the payroll (Ex­hibit A) and the corresponding checks
from <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Lorenzo for delivery to the persons
whose names appear in said payroll.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accused denied that he instigated the filing of two cases of
falsification against <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> and to bolster said
denial accused presented Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Costales</span>, 54 years
old, married and Second Assistant Provincial Fiscal of La Union."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In fairness to the accused, <span class="GramE">We</span> are
constrained to include hereunder the more detailed statement of facts submitted
by him in his Brief, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"The <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>La
  Union</st1:placename></st1:place> undertook as one of its projects the
program known as the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Kalusugan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Masagana</span> '99 Program, the implementation of which became a
joint program of its Bureau of Plant Industry and its Bureau of Agricul­tural
Extension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Government employees detailed
as production technicians in the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> Program
received incentive allow­ances from the NFAC during the covered period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their detail as production tech­nicians of
the said program was <span class="GramE">effected</span> only by a special order
emanating from the Bureau of Plant Industry Director; and be­fore the employee
received his incentive pay, he was required to prepare his Daily Time Record
for the particular month and submit a Certification attesting to the fact that
he was detailed to the program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the case-at-bar, complainant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>,
an employee of the Bureau of Plant Industry, was detailed to the program from <span class="SpellE">from</span> <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="2">February 2,
 1975</st1:date> up to December 1977, his assignment of work being contained in
the NFAC Order captioned 'Detail and Designation of Personnel to NFAC, in
connection with the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> Program' where his name
appeared opposite item 60 thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit 6)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Making it appear that he was sur­prised to learn that he was
supposed to receive his NFAC incentive pay for the months of January, February
and March 1977 because he was not entitled thereto as he was not anymore
connected with the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> Program; and falsely
making it appear that some person other than himself received his incentive pay
by allegedly forging his sig­nature on the Daily Time Records, the Pay­roll and
the Certification required and submitted - complainant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> caused to be filed a complaint against the
petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borje</span>,
supervising agro­nomist of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Region I, before the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant contends that complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
was paid his incentive pay for the months of January to March, 1977 in the
total sum of P225.00 as <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was included in the
payroll since he has worked with the Program as shown by Special Order No. 72
issued by the BPI Director and concurrent Executive Director of NFAC, Domingo <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, and that said Special Order, Exhibit 6 entitled
"Detail and Designation of BPI Personnel to NFAC in Connection with the <span class="SpellE">Masagana</span> '99 Program effective January to December
1977" and dated May 17, 1977, included the name Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>, herein complainant, opposite item No. 60 in page 2
of the Exhibit and marked Exhibit 6-A (TSN, Aug. 27, 1980, pp. 43-46).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He confirms substantially the official
procedure in the preparation of the payroll and subsequent payment of the
incentive pay to the produc­tion technicians as described by witness <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Lorenzo, disbursing officer and cashier for the
BPI office in <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, La
Union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he vigorously denies
having received the payroll and the corresponding checks from witness Lorenzo
as his participation in the preparation of the said payroll ended with his
signing thereof after which the payroll goes to the disbursing officer for the
prepa­ration and issuance of the checks to the payees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented in evidence certified true copies of
two (2) criminal <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for falsification dated
August 13, 1979 filed by Assistant Provincial Fiscal Jacinto <span class="SpellE">Costales</span> against complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
before the Court of First Instance of La Union, Branch III, <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>,
docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. <span class="GramE">A-893 (Exhibit 1) and A-894
(Exhibit 2).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused contends
that the instant case against him was initiated by <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
to get even with the petitioner as the complainant admitted in
cross-examination that he believes that <span class="SpellE">Borje</span>
instigated said two criminal cases against him (TSN, Aug. 25, 1980, pp. 21-27).</p>

<p class="BODY">Further contending that complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
was doing dual work from July, 1976 up to December, 1977, the defense presented
Exhibits 5 to 5-C which is Memorandum Order No. 56, Series of 1976, dated June
11, 1976, issued by BPI Director <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span> for the
implementation of the Plant Pest and Disease Surveillance and Early Warning
Monitoring Project under the Philippine-German Crop Protection Program which
shows that complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was included in the
list of personnel assigned to the Surveillance and Early Warning System (SEWS)
team as Plant Pest Control Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
ac­cused-appellant declared that although <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> was
named to this SEWS team, he continued working with the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span>
Program as production technician during said work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense disclaims the authenticity of the prosecu­tion's
Exhibit H which is purportedly the original <span class="SpellE">Borje</span>
reply letter to BPI Regional Director <span class="SpellE">Varquez</span>’
endorsement of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin's</span> resignation letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, Exhibit 8 was presented in evidence
as the genuine carbon copy of <span class="SpellE">Borje's</span> signed letter
reply dated May 5, 1978 in response to <span class="SpellE">Varquez</span>'
memorandum of May 3, 1978 wherein petitioner recommended disapproval of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin's</span> resignation in order that <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
could face the charges against him in connection with his work with the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> Program.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, Aug. 27, 1980, pp. 56-58, 90).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in its decision
formulated two issues determinative of the innocence or guilt of the accused,
to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Whether or not the Time book
and Payroll (Exhi­bit A), the certification (Exhibit C) and the Daily Time
Records (Exhibit D) in support of said payroll were falsified; and (2) If they
were, the liability of the accused, if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As indicated earlier, the accused-appellant was found guilty by
respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant appeal by way of <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner submits the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUM">I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent court erred

public documents, the same not having been established by proof beyond
reasonable doubt, considering that:</p>

SEWS, and therefore, still entitled to the NFAC allowance.</span></blockquote>

find it imperative and compelling to describe and detail the nature and

</span>In the instant case, since there is the Special Order No. 172 of
Executive Director Domingo <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, concurrently
BPI <span class="GramE">Director,</span> marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6,
"Detail and Designation of BPI personnel to NFAC in con­nection with the
Masagana-99 Program effective January to December, 1977" listing
complainant for the assignment and detail, the inclusion of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin's</span>
name in the payroll was not irregular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the payroll is prepared by the Budget Office based on the
Special Order and not by the petitioner's office.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>, he
was no longer connected with the <span class="SpellE">Masagana</span> Program
during the period of January to March 1977 because his assignment thereto had
been terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he was asked this
question by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"JUSTICE ESCAREAL:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>What
evidence do you have that you were removed in 1977 and you were no longer
performing your duties as technician?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>It
is only verbal." (TSN, p. 47, Aug. 25, 1980)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The alleged verbal order is doubtful for under normal and usual
official procedure, a written special order issued by a government office is
cancelled, amended or modified only by another written special order, not only
for purposes of record on file but also to prevent conflict and confusion in
government operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, under
the best evidence rule, Section 2, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, the supposed
verbal order cannot prevail over the written, Special Order No. 172 stated
above.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, however,
justified the con­viction of the accused on the basis of the testimony of
witness <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Lorenzo, Regional Disbursing Officer
and Cashier, to the effect that she delivered the payroll and checks to
petitioner accused-appellant, relying further on the presumption that as
possessor of the document, accused-appellant is presumed to have falsified it.</p>

<p class="BODY">But reviewing the testimony of witness Lorenzo, the records
disclose that her original testimony at the rein­vestigation of the case before
the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> was favorable to the accused, saying
that she delivered the payroll and the checks to the complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>, even identifying the genuine signature of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> on the payroll.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We quote hereunder excerpts of her testimony:</p>

<p class="BODY">The contradictory and conflicting testimonies of this witness only
proves her unreliability and unworthiness in respect to the sanctity of the
witness' oath.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although she tried to
explain her complete "turn-about" by saying during the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> hearing:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"They told me that if I will testify against them, I will be
accessory and I don't want to be involved in the case because I am not the one
really who delivered the checks to the production technician, sir." (TSN,
p. 18, Aug. 27, 1980), the conclusion of the respondent court that she was
intimidated to testify in favor of the accused during the reinvestigation is
not war­ranted, considering that the witness herself is a high re­gional
official, being the Regional Disbursing Officer and Cashier and not subordinate
to but perhaps co-equal in rank to the petitioner and, therefore, may not be so
easily intimidated by the accused who was in no position or power to include
her as accessory in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lorenzo's
testimony given at the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> hearing is not
worthy of belief and must be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also reject respondent court's reliance on the pre­sumption
that as possessor of the document, the accused is presumed to be the author of
the falsification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place,
the factual basis which is the Lorenzo testi­mony which <span class="GramE">We</span>
have reviewed as doubtful and variable, cannot be credited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner has denied vigorously the
testimony of Lorenzo that he received the payroll and the checks from her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that his participation in the
preparation of the payroll ended with his signing thereof after which the payroll
goes to the Disbursing Officer for the preparation and issuance of the checks
to the payees at which time the payee affix their signatures on the payroll,
which is subs­tantially corroborated by the original testimony of the witness
Lorenzo during the reinvestigation of the case before the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, Exhibit "A" appears to be also
signed by ten (10) other production technicians listed in the payroll, besides
complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is <span class="SpellE">initialled</span> by three (3) personnel in the
Accounting Services Unit and further signed by the Regional Accountant and for
the Regional Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of these
persons were at one time or another in possession of the document, all of them
had the same opportunity impliedly imputed to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payroll must have been carried and passed
by messengers and other employees from one office to another, from one desk to
ano­ther for purposes of typing, funding, <span class="SpellE">initialling</span>,
verifi­cation, certification, accounting, recording, drawing of the check and
finally, issuing of the check.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Our
view, the respondent court's reliance on the presumption which is only <span class="GramE">presumptive,</span> is misplaced and unwarranted, there being no
sufficient reason to apply the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense contends that the prosecution, having pre­sented <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies only of the falsified documents, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "D" and "C", failed to prove the <u>corpus</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>delicti</u></span> of the crime charged, citing the case
of U.S. vs. Gregorio, 17 Phil. 522.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this case of Gregorio, the Supreme Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"In a criminal case for the falsification of a document, it is
indispensable that the judges and the courts have before them the document
alleged to have been simulated, coun­terfeited or falsified, in order that they
may find, pursuant to the evidence produced at the trial, whether or not the
crime of fal­sification was actually committed; in the absence of the original
document, it is impro­per to conclude, with only a copy of the said original in
view, that there has been a fal­sification of a document which was neither
found nor exhibited, because, in such a case, even the existence of such
original document may be doubted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reacting to the defense contention, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
held that "(a)<span class="SpellE">ccused's</span> claim that in the absence
of the original documents it is improper to conclude that there is
falsification of document in accordance with the case of U.S. vs. Gregorio, 17
Phil. 522, is sleazy for the case referred to is not in point," and then
attempted to differentiate said case with the case at bar by holding that
"(h)ad the issue confronting the Court been one of alteration or
superimposition of signatures or word or figure, then the issue of bringing out
the original may have relevance." The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
further added:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"At any rate, it is
worthwhile to note that with the develop­ment of modern copying devices which
virtually eliminate the possibility of error in reproduction of the original,
the relevancy of the doctrine in <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Gregorio is now open to question."</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the respondent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the <u>Gregorio</u> ruling makes no
distinction for the doctrine itself applies in criminal proceedings for the
falsification of a document, whether simulated, counterfeited, or falsi­fied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the <u>Gregorio</u> doctrine is
still tenable, notwithstanding modern copying devices for a falsified do­cument,
passed off as an original can also be duplicated by <span class="SpellE">xeroxing</span>
and thereafter, certified as true copy of the original as in <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And thirdly, considering that in the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">xeroxing</span> was done or caused to be done by complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> (TSN, pp. 189-191, Aug. 25 1980) after taking out
the original documents without the official authority and permission of the
Disbursing Officer and Cashier, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> Lorenzo, who
was then out on rural service and thereafter the originals were lost, misplaced
and are now missing, the failure to present the originals is sus­picious for
complainant had ulterior and ill motives in accusing the petitioner as will be
shown hereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ill <span class="GramE">motives of the complainant in falsely
accusing the accused-appellant is</span> easily discernible herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is presented Exhibit "1",
certified true copy of the infor­mation filed against complainant Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> in Criminal Case No. A-893, CFI, <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union, for falsification com­mitted on or about <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1975</st1:date> in relation to the
grant of farmer's loan under the <span class="SpellE">Gulayan</span> <span class="GramE">Sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kalusugan</span> Food Pro­duction
Program when complainant was assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>
Rural Bank, and a similar information for falsification against <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> in Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">A-894, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "2".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Referring to these two (2) cases, <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
declared that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> motivated the filing
of the cases; that in the filing of the case in the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office in San Fernando, La Union, there is an affidavit of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> and that because of
that affidavit, it was Mr. <span class="SpellE">Borje</span> who motivated the
filing of the charge against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, pp. 26-27, Aug. 25, 1980).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is also the refusal of the petitioner
to recommend acceptance of the resignation of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>
until he shall have cleared matters with the Rural Bank of <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>,
La Union considering that the total amount of P52<span class="GramE">,047.73</span>
is involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Exhibit
"8").</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is established that the absence of evidence as to an
improper motive actuating the offended party and the principal prosecution
witness tends to sustain the conclusion that no such improper motive existed
and that their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amiscua</span>, 37 SCRA 813; People vs. Mercado, 38 SCRA 168;
People vs. <span class="SpellE">Valdemoro</span>, 102 SCRA 170).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, where there is showing as to
improper motives, as in the case at bar, the testimony of complainant <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> is un­worthy of faith and credit and, therefore,
deserves scant consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since
the prosecution theory is built or based on such testimony, the cause of the
prosecution collapses or falls with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to respondent court, its conclusion that the accused
falsified or caused to be falsified the document in question is further
supported by the following facts:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that the accused confessed to him that he was the one who got the money and
offered immediately to <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> the sum of P225.00 to
cover the incentive pay so that <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> will just
keep silent but <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> did not accept the money; and
(2) that in his reply to the letter of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> denoun­cing
the forging of his signature that he received his incentive pay from January to
March, 1977, the accused tried to justify the falsification of the time record
as shown in the portion of said reply, Exhibit "H".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the ill-motives of the complainant as shown
above, this particular assertion of <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> which is
uncorroborated is sleazy, that is, flimsy, shabby, cheap or unsubstantial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner's reply marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "H" is not an admission of the accused that
he falsified or caused to be falsified the documents in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In fact, examining <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "H", it says that "his (<span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span>) daily time record (was) prepared by other
employees in order to justify such payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The authenticity of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>, "H" is
denied by the petitioner who presented <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"8" as the real and cor­rect copy duly received and initialed by the
Regional Office, and therein, he wrote:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"I therefore deny knowledge of the alleged forgery of the signature
of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ducusin</span> in the same payroll."</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the defense puts forth the exemplary and distinguished
record of the petitioner as a public servant, having been in the government
service for more than twenty (20) years and multi-awarded and commended for
meritorious services, among them as scholar under the Colombo Plan specializing
in pest management in England; Diploma of Merit as Most Outstanding Employee in
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>; Award as one of
the Most Outstanding Green Revolutionist in the Philippines, 1976; and Award as
one of the Most Outstanding Bureau of Plant Industry Employees, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And citing the case of <span class="SpellE">Manero</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, 102 SCRA 817 wherein the Supreme Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"(T)he petitioner exhibited an exemplary record as a
policeman; he was thrice cited by his superiors for refusing to accept a bribe,
was commended for minimizing armed robberies, was twice the recipient to
Letters of Appreciation and has been recommended for promotion on the basis of
known honesty and integrity xxx,"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">in</span> sustaining
the innocence of the accused, petitioner also prays for his acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record and services of the accused-appellant is, indeed
praiseworthy and commendable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But an
accused is not entitled to an acquittal simply because of his previous good
moral character and exemplary conduct if the court believes he is guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> or reversal of his conviction
must be resolved on the basic issue of whether the prosecution has discharged
its duty of proving his guilt beyond perad­venture of doubt, of convincing the
court as to the moral certainty of his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that, on the whole, the evidence presented against
the accused in the case at bar is not clear, com­petent and convincing, and
considering further that there is jurisprudence which, by analogy, supports the
defense in U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Balais</span>, 17 Phil. 503 wherein We
held:</p>

<blockquote>"The municipal treasurer who 'certifies that the official
payroll he signs is correct, that the services have been rendered and the
payments made as stated,' does not pervert the truth in the narration of the
facts, if the persons certified as municipal secretary and clerk to the
municipal president were duly appointed and qualified as such municipal
secretary and clerk to the municipal presi­dent, discharging the duties of
their respective offices, the services certified having been rendered at the
time referred to in the payroll, and both persons having received their
respective salaries from the municipal treasurer certifying the payroll.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor can it be taken as proving the
falsification of the document if it is subsequently discovered that the
services were really not rendered by the aforementioned persons themselves but
by subs­titutes; for it is not the mission of the mu­nicipal treasurer to take
upon himself to in­vestigate whether the persons accredited to him as secretary
and clerk, by the municipal council and whom he, in turn, acknowledges and pays
their monthly salary, really or apparently perform the duties of such
offices," </blockquote>
