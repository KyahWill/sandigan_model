<blockquote>"At about 10:00 P.M. of November 5, 1976 accused called at the
house of deceased <span class="SpellE">Ofremia</span> <span class="SpellE">Atup</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Sarabosing</span> located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Binliw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ubay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> for the purpose
of submitting himself to the latter for treatment of his snake­bite located at
his left foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His announced purpose
being good, the deceased opened the door for him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside, the deceased took her medicine
paraphernalia (she being a local quack doctor) and started treating the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then all of a sudden the
accused drew his <span style="">small </span>bolo
(Exhibit A) and stabbed the deceased several times causing her to fall on the
floor dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After killing the deceased
accused proceeded to the house of the son of the deceased for the purpose of
killing him and his wife but accused did not accomplish his purpose because the
deceased's son refused to let him enter his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that the accused surrendered himself
with his bolo to policeman <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilad</span> who was then on guard at the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Ubay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked why
he killed the deceased who was also his grandmother-in-law, accused answered,
'because she promised to kill <span style="">me </span>with
a '<span class="SpellE">barang</span>' hence I killed her first.' (Testimonies of
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Atup</span>, policeman <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>

<blockquote>"At about 9:00 P.M. on November 5, 1976 accused went to tend
to his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the way, he was bitten by a snake at the smallest toe of his left
foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he proceeded to the house
of his grandmother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Ofremia</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabosing</span> which was located in barrio <span class="SpellE">Binliw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ubay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> for treatment
of snake-bite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ofre­mia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sarabosing</span> was a quack doctor known to cure
snake-bites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">arrived at </span>deceased's house at about 10:00 P.M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased opened the door to let him
enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once inside he and the deceased
stood on the <span style="">floor facing </span>each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the deceased instructed
accused to open <span style="">his </span>snake-bite
with a bolo (Exhibit A) so that the venom can be drained out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <span style="">he
was opening </span>his snake-bite with a bolo, <span style="">he </span>accidentally put out the light of <span style="">the ke</span>rosene lamp which was placed on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted the deceased to relight said
lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She bended her body down with her
two hands extended towards the floor to <span style="">light
</span>said lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">At </span>the very time that <span style="">deceased was </span>bending her body
downward, accused lifted his right hand which was holding the bolo, upward, so
that the point <span style="">of </span>the bolo accidentally
hit deceased's right chest <span style="">penetrat</span>ing
the nipple and resulting in her <span style="">death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Upon realizing <span style="">that </span>the deceased was fatally wounded, accused asked for <span style="">her </span>forgiveness and after that he ran

<p class="BODY">As the trial court prefaced its <span style="">decision, </span>which version is correct?</p>

<p class="BODY">That the deceased died from wounds inflicted by the appellant is
not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As gleaned from the
opposing versions set forth above, the conflict is in how the wounds were
inflicted - whether with deliberate intent, or purely by accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is extremely difficult to accept the accident version of
appellant which he purveyed without corroboration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">More
than one wound was found sustained by the deceased, on different parts of the
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">One</span><span style=""> single stroke could
not have inflicted all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first wound could possibly have been accidentally inflicted, but the other
wounds could not have been similarly inflicted if, as just pointed out, they
did not result from the first </span><span style="">blow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Their
locations preclude that a single blow produced all the wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This fact robs the accident theory </span><span style="">of appellant of </span><span style="">any plausibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The explanation of
appellant as to how th</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">wounds other </span>than that located on the
right chest was</span> inflicted simply cannot inspire belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">trying
</span>to succor the old woman when she fell upon being hit accidentally with
the point of the bolo, as appellant alleged, he could not have kept on holding
the bolo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have dropped it
instantly, as instinct would have made him do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The infliction of more
wounds after the first was therefore deliberate and not by mere accident.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, likewise, hard to believe that a mere
accidental hitting with the point of the <span style="">small
bolo, and </span>therefore not with so much force, would inflict a wound that
is <span class="GramE">so</span> fatal as that sustained on the chest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>That the wounding was with
intent to kill is reflected by appellant's statement that he killed the old
woman because she had allegedly promised to kill him by "<span class="SpellE">barang</span>" or by witchcraft, which he gave upon
surrendering to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Demetrio</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Basilad</span>
at the Municipal Building.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just natural for appellant to explain
to the </span><span style="">police why </span><span style="">he was surrendering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilad</span> to testify </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">what appellant said
on this score is thus perfectly proper, and full credence must be accorded to
him, being obviously an </span><span style="">im­</span><span style="">partial witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a matter of whether the statement
is a part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
to be admissible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant of course denies
having made the admission, but in the light of the other evidence of the
prosecution, </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">denial is not convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As demonstrated earlier, his accident theory
of the killing merits not much credibility</span><span style=""> from </span>the mere fact that more than one wound was inflicted <span style="">which could not have resulted from just </span>o<span style="">n</span>e <span style="">blow.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Repeated
blows easily negates</span> any claim of wounding by mere accident.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fact that he was not
allowed to enter the house of Juanita <span class="SpellE">Busalla</span>,
daughter of the deceased, when he went there directly from the old woman's
house, would show that he appeared, by his behavior or </span><span style="">words, </span><span style="">that he </span><span style="">was danger</span><span style="">ously in an angry mood, which is </span><span style="">indicative </span><span style="">of being a delibe</span>rate killer rather than <span style="">a </span>sorrowful and harmless penitent <span style="">for </span><span style="">a killing he has
committed only by accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Juanita
also testified, when appellant was already in jail, </span><span style="">he </span><span style="">told </span><span style="">her that he killed
her mother because of witchcraft, corro­borating Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basilad's</span></span><span class="GramE"> testimon<span style="">y</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would, therefore, be of no avail for
appellant to contend that the </span><span style="">court
</span><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> erred in admitting appellant's
statement he made </span><span style="">upon sur</span><span style="">rendering that he killed the deceased </span><span style="">because </span><span style="">the latter intended to kill him by witchcraft as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">gestae</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="">The testimony of both Pat.</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Basilad</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">and Juanita </span><span class="SpellE">Busalla</span> on the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
statement of appellant is legally admissible not because the statement is part
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>,
but for said witnesses having heard appellant made the statement on their own
perception.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is hard to see why the
aforementioned witnesses testified on the admission of appellant the way they
did unless they were prompted only by the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If appellant had
surrendered with an admission of killing the old woman by accident, as he must
have tried to impress upon the authorities if such was the truth, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilad</span> had no reason to give the killing the graver
character than what it really was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
far as he is concerned, he had no more <span class="GramE">problem</span>
relative to the solution of the crime, which is the usual cause for police
twisting the truth or other form of excesses when conducting investigations-the
desire to solve a crime by all means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That Dr. <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaviola</span> who issued the
post-mortem examination report failed to testify thereon because he died before
he could be called to the stand, so unduly stressed to show the quality of his
report as hearsay, does not affect the sufficiency of the evidence against
appellant to entitle him to the acceptance of his claim of accident to exempt
him from criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
shown, such evidence is more than adequate to make the mind rest at ease on
appellant's guilt as charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
autopsy report, if not admitted as such, is part of the testimony of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sarabosing</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified on the number and location of
the wounds, and his testimony, being that of a peace officer with basic
knowledge in medico-legal medicine, having taken a course therein (p. 26, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 21, 1978) may well serve the purpose of the
autopsy report, if the report is not itself admissible as independent evidence,
as appellant would insist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant has also
invoked the provision of Article IV, Section 20 of the Constitution in trying
to block the admission of his declaration to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basilad</span></span><span class="GramE"> that he killed <span class="SpellE">Ofremia</span> <span class="SpellE">Atup</span> because of her
alleged vow to kill him by witchcraft, contending that the safeguards <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> have not been made available to him.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cited provision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 20.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>No person shall be compelled to be a witness
against himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person under
investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain
silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or
any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The applicability of the
foregoing provision does not seem to contemplate cases like the present where
no written confession was sought to be presented in evidence as a result of
formal custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
testified to <span class="GramE">is</span> only what appellant told the police
why he is surrendering to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
but natural for one who surrenders to the police to give reason or explanation
for his act of surrendering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can hardly
be said </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">under such circumstance, the <span class="SpellE">surrenderee</span> is already "under investigation",
within the meaning of the constitutional pro­vision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">As the Solicitor General
correctly observes on the circumstances of this case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If however, he voluntarily admits the
killing and it was precisely because he surrendered to admit <span style="">the killing, the </span>constitutional
safeguards to be informed of his rights to silence and to counsel may not be
invoked."</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any case, as</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">previously
pointed </span><span style="">out, another witness,
Juanita <span class="SpellE">Busalla</span>, who is not a policeman also
testified to appellant telling her when he was already in jail, that he killed <span class="SpellE">Ofremia</span> <span class="SpellE">Atup</span> because of her
promise to kill him by means of witchcraft, the same declaration he supposedly
made to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basilad</span></span><span class="GramE">, upon surrendering after <span style="">the
</span>killing.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
constitutional safeguard invoked can have no application to Juanita's testimony
on </span><span style="">what </span><span style="">appellant told her not in the course of a
police investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At </span><span style="">any rate, even without </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">admission, the acci­dent version of appellant is inherently
incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, that he
was not allowed by <span class="SpellE">Ofremia's</span> daughter and husband to
enter their house when he went there direct from the old woman's house is a
strong </span><span style="">proof </span><span style="">that he did not exhibit the harmless mood of
a repentant killer as he should visibly appear to </span><span style="">them if </span><span style="">the killing was only accidental.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, he must have appeared so angry, displaying unmistakable
intent to kill them, after killing their mother, as the daughter Juanita <span class="SpellE">Busalla</span>, so testified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(pp. 30-39, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span></span><st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="2"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Feb. 1, 1978</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">).</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Verily, the issue is one
of credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The lower court gave more of it to the
testimony of the prosecution </span><span style="">witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to disturb the lower
court's appreciation of the relative credibility of the opposing witnesses.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, appellant having admitted the kill­ing, the burden of proving
the exempting circumstance he has invoked in his defense calls for clear and
convincing evidence, as is required of similar defenses as </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">of self-defense.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This,
