the Court of Appeals, is a controversy over possession of a parcel of land, the
proper resolution of which calls for a determination of the ownership thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The more than eleven (11) hectares of agricultural land in
dispute is located in <span class="SpellE">Buguey</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
originally registered on 28 December 1936 in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">name </span>of "Heirs of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>",
and covered by Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 1648.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1940, said certificate of title was
cancelled and, in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 1005
was issued in the name of <span class="SpellE">Maximiniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>, wife
and daughter, respectively of the deceased Esteban <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each of the then new owners owned an
undivided one-half (1/2) portion of or interest in the land.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Maximiniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
died during the Japanese occupation, leaving behind her only child Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>, then married to <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vallangca</span> with whom she had three (3) children,
namely, Benjamin, Rodolfo and Alfredo, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Vallangca</span>
who are the petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petition at bar, the following events led to the
present controversy:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Vallangca's</span>
death in 1944, his widow Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>, together with
her eldest son Benjamin, went to Centro, <span class="SpellE">Buguey</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> and mortgaged the land in dispute to her cousin <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> (private
respondent herein) for Eight Hundred Pesos (P800.00) in Japanese war notes, to
cover the burial expenses of her deceased husband <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vallangca</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There being no notary public in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
</span>place at the time, the agreement was not reduced to writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of said mortgage of the land to <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>, the land was
already mortgaged to the Philippine National Bank (PNB), said first mortgage
having been executed on <st1:date year="1940" day="16" month="11">16 November
 1940</st1:date>, and annotated on said TCT No. 1005.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the Pacific war, <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> went to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">residence
</span>of Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> on 2 February 1946 and made the
latter sign a document which <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> represented to
Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> as a mortgage contract written in the <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span> dialect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Billena</span>, being an illiterate and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">trusting in her cousin </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>),
affixed her signature on the document in the space indicated to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that same year, 1946, <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> was
informed by cousin of <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> and another witness to
the document that the alleged mortgage contract which she had signed was
actually a deed of absolute sale to <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> of the
land covered by TCT No. 1005.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> and her son Benjamin, thereupon, went to <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>' place for the purpose <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>redeeming the land and actually tendered to him the loan
amount of P800.00, this time, in genuine and legal Philippine currency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
told them that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>land could no
longer be redeemed and he drove them out of his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> and her three (3)
sons were in possession and actual cultivation of the land in question,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
filed against them on <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="7">7 July 1971</st1:date>
an injunction suit before the Court of First instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
(Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">II-14).</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
At the pre-trial of said injunction suit, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
was advised by the trial court that injunction <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>not the proper cause of action, because injunction was merely
an ancillary or provisional remedy to a main action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="9">11
 September 1972</st1:date>, another complaint entitled "Recovery of
Possession" (Civil Case No. II-39)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was lodged by <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> before the same court against
the same defendants in the action for injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>T<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">wo </span>(2)
days later, or on <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="9">13 September 1972</st1:date>,
the action for injunction was ordered dismissed by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order of dismissal reads as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Nazario</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
(later substituted by his heirs) had another version of the events.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span>
knowingly signed a deed of absolute sale in his favor on <st1:date year="1946" day="2" month="2">2 February 1946</st1:date> as she had actually sold and not
merely mortgaged the land in controversy for P800.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> alleged
that from then on, his tenants, <span class="SpellE">Serapio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and Fernando <span class="SpellE">Gagmante</span>,
cultivated the land, until they were driven out by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">three (3) sons </span>of Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> sometime
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">in </span>1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial in the second action involving recovery of
possession, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
on 24 September 1976, rendered judgment declaring plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
(herein respondent) as the rightful owner of the land and ordered the
defendants (herein petitioners) to vacate the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The trial court reasoned thus -</p>

when his mother </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">signed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the document under the alleged influence of
the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also signed it as a
witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With that tender age, we doubt
if he understood the meaning </span>or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">difference
between a mortgage and a sale of real property, so how can he say now that his
mother was influenced into signing Exhibit ‘F’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He did </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">say </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>They were not living in the same house and there </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">no evidence that he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> part of the judgment reads
-</p>

<p class="BODY">From the above judgment, the defendants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, invoking, the rule on "<span class="SpellE">res</span>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span>", contend that the dismissal of the
"Injunction" case filed on 7 July 1971 by <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
against them, barred the filing by <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> against
them of the second action for "Recovery of Possession".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners maintain that the first suit,
although styled as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span>"Injunction",
had for its actual primary purpose the recovery of the land in dispute and,
therefore, after its dismissal, no other action for recovery of possession of
the same land and against the same parties (herein petitioners) could be
pursued by the same complainant (<span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this connection, petitioners would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">stress </span>the fact that the dismissal of
the suit for injunction was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not made
without prejudice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also petitioners' contention that the respondent's
complaint for injunction had already prescribed, before its filing on <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="7">7 July 1971</st1:date>, under Section 40 of Act <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">190, which provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">According to petitioners, from the date
private respondent claims to have bought the land, that is, 2 February 1946,
more than ten (10) years had elapsed when <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span>
filed on 7 July 1971 his action for injunction which, in effect, was an action
for recovery <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>possession of the
disputed land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is </span>further
urged by petitioners that it was not likely that their mother Ana <span class="SpellE">Billena</span> would consent to sell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

name of both <span class="SpellE">Maximiniana</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>

at the time the defendants interposed <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span><u> </u>as an affirmative defense in their

injunction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case </span>had already
become final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal order assumed
the character of finality, there being no showing that there was an appeal of

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in holding that the date of the filing of

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Court of Appeals arrived at the

<p class="BODY">These articles embody decisional rules laid down even before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Civil Code (30 August 1950) so that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>of no

<p class="BODY">There was gross inadequacy of price, because the land was sold

<p class="BODY">The other factor to consider is the continuous physical
possession by the petitioners of the property for almost nine (9) long years,
or from 1962 to the filing of the injunction case by respondent <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> in 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even assuming for the sake of argument, as the Court of Appeals
believed, that <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> acquired possession of the
land thru <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his tenants in 1946 and
continued such possession till 1962, when they were allegedly dispossessed by
the petitioners, one nevertheless can not ignore the <span class="SpellE">unrefuted</span>
fact that, from 1962 until the filing of said injunction case in 1971, it was
the petitioners <span class="SpellE">Vallangcas</span> who were in actual and
physical possession of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
did it take <span class="SpellE">Rabanes</span> nine (9) years more or less to

<p class="BODY">Apart from the foregoing considerations is still one <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">fact</span></u> that the trial court and the
