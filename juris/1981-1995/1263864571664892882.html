				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases have been consolidated because they involve the
same issue against the respondent Director of the National Bureau of
Investigation, who has refused to reinstate the petitioners in defiance of the
orders of the Civil Service Commission as referred to him by the Secretary of
Justice for implementation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The services of Francisco R. <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>
as Agent III and of Cesar R. de Leon as Head Agent in the National Bureau of
Investigation were terminated by then Minister of Justice <span class="SpellE">Neptali</span>
A. Gonzales in separate Orders both dated January 27, 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Both appealed to the Review Committee created under Executive Order No. 17, but
this body declined to act on their petitions for reconsideration on the ground
that it had lost jurisdiction with the ratification of the new Constitution on <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were advised instead to seek relief from
the Civil Service Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>

Orders,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
they were sustained by the Merit Systems Protection Board of the said
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was held that their
dismissals were invalid and unconstitutional, having been done in violation of
their security of tenure under the 1987 Constitution, which had already become
effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Board
ordered their reinstatement with back salaries but without prejudice to the
filing of appropriate administrative charges against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1987</st1:date>,
Undersecretary of Justice Eduardo G. Montenegro referred the order reinstating <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> to the respondent as Director of the National
Bureau of Investigation "for his information and appropriate action."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1988</st1:date>,
Undersecretary of Justice Silvestre H. <span class="SpellE">Bello</span> III
referred the order reinstating De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the respondent "for appropriate action" and "immediate
implementation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The reaction of the respondent was to return the said orders to
the Civil Service Commission "without action," claiming that they
were null and void for having been rendered without jurisdiction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This prompted the Board to issue another Order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date>, in which it rejected the
respondent's contention and concluded that "it appearing that the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to appeal has long expired, the orders
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1987</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1988</st1:date>, of this Board have

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1989</st1:date>,
Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> A. <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span>
filed his Consolidated Comment through Undersecretary Eduardo G. Montenegro and
declared:</p>

<blockquote>It is submitted that the Orders of the Merit Systems Protection
Board reinstating Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> and de Leon are
valid and should be respected by the agency head concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dismissals pursuant to E.O. No. 17 are
summary and contemplate non-adversary proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not dismissals for cause within the
meaning of the security of tenure provisions of the Civil Service Law and of
the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal from the
service of Messrs. <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> and de Leon was made
pursuant to E.O. No. 17; but as the Review Committee observed, the dismissal
was effective upon receipt by the petitioners of their respective notices of
termination on March 6, 1987 for Mr. <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span>, and on
February 6, 1987, for Mr. de Leon, or several days after the ratification of
the 1987 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their dismissal
was, therefore, virtually a dismissal under the 1987 Constitution then already
in place; and because it was a summary dismissal as the intention really was to
dismiss them pursuant to E.O. No. 17, it did not conform with the requirements
of due process consistent with the security of tenure clause embodied in the
1987 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The separate Orders
of the Merit Systems Protection Board directing their reinstatement in office
"but without prejudice to the filing of appropriate administrative charges
against (them) as evidence warrants, in accordance with the Civil Service Law
and Rules" (see Annexes "2" and "5") are, therefore
consistent with the Constitutional mandate that "(n)o officer or employee
of the civil service shall be removed or suspended except for cause provided by
law" (Sec. 2[3], Art. IX-B, 1987 Constitution).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His conclusion read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The Secretary of Justice reiterates the directives of the
Department of Justice, namely, his Memorandum dated June 29, 1988, 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated September 29, 1987 of Undersecretary of
Justice Eduardo G. Montenegro, and 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated March 14, 1988 of Undersecretary of Justice Silvestre <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>
III, all addressed to NBI Director J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>,
to reinstate Messrs. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> and Cesar de
Leon to their former positions in compliance with the Orders dated August 27,
1987, March 4, 1988 and June 20, 1988 of the Merit Systems Protection Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Secretary of Justice finds no valid reasons why the aforesaid
Orders of the Merit Systems Protection Board regarding the reinstatement of
Messrs. Francisco <span class="SpellE">Estavillo</span> and Cesar de Leon, should
not be implemented.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1989</st1:date>,
the respondent filed a Reply without having previously been allowed or required
by the Court to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He began by
insinuating that as the above consolidated cases had already been submitted for
decision, we should not have required additional pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We can disregard this temerity as an
unintentional insolence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it cannot
be as easily dismissed that in this Reply Director <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>
has again manifested his defiance of Secretary <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More direct this time, the respondent insists
"that the Secretary of Justice had no power to declare invalid or
unconstitutional any Presidential proclamation, order, instruction or rule and
regulation." "Neither could he ignore the final decision of the
former Minister of Justice" "nor (could he) compel compliance to
(sic) said order of the Civil Service Commission issued with want of
jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY">One may well wonder how Secretary <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span>
would react to this new challenge to his authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps the <span class="SpellE">forebearing</span>
Secretary would prefer to be tactful again as when he opted not to make a
categorical statement in his Consolidated Comment on Director <span class="SpellE">Carpio's</span> obvious intransigence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, for all his restrained and
courteous language, the Secretary's position is clear enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is not the slightest indication that he
has relented on his memorandum of <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="6">June
 29, 1988</st1:date>, or that he now supports the Director's belligerent stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an elementary principle of our republican government,
enshrined in the Constitution and honored not in the breach but in the observance,
that all executive departments, bureaus and offices are under the control of
the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This precept, first embodied in the
Commonwealth Constitution and<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">11</span></span></a> reiterated in the 1973
Constitution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">12</span></span></a>,
has been retained in Article VII, Section 17 of the present Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President's power of control is directly exercised by him
over the members of the Cabinet who, in turn and by his authority, control the
bureaus and other offices under their respective jurisdictions in the executive
department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional vesture
of this power in the President is self-executing and does not require statutory
implementation, nor may its exercise be limited, much less withdrawn, by the
legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in <span class="SpellE">Lacson-Magallanes</span> v. PaÃ±o,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">13</span></span></a> the
Court held that a statute making decisions of the department secretaries final
and <span class="SpellE">unappealable</span> would nevertheless not prevent the
President from reviewing and if necessary reversing such decisions by virtue of
his constitutional power of control over the members of his Cabinet.</p>

<p class="BODY">Theoretically, the President has full control of all the members
of his Cabinet and may appoint them as he sees fit or shuffle them at pleasure,
subject only to confirmation by the Commission on Appointments, and replace
them in his discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once in place,
they are at all times under the disposition the President as their immediate
superior.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice Laurel put it aptly in
<span class="SpellE">Villena</span> v. Secretary of the Interior,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">14</span></span></a>
when he said that "without minimizing the importance of the heads of the
various departments, their personality is in reality but the projection of that
of the President." Hence, "their acts, performed and promulgated in
the regular course of business are, unless disapproved or reprobated by the
Chief Executive, presumptively the acts of the Chief Executive."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is recalled that in <span class="SpellE">Noblejas</span> v.
Salas,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">15</span></span></a>
the fiscal who conducted the preliminary investigation recommended that no
criminal action be taken against the petitioner in view of the insufficiency of
evidence against him and the finding that he had acted in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This recommendation was expressly approved by
the Secretary of Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
the new fiscal who had taken over the prosecution disregarded these acts and
included the petitioner among the accused in the same criminal case covered by
the Secretary's directive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
granted <i><u>certiorari</u></i> and set aside the resolution of the trial
court denying the petitioner's motion to quash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We held that the fiscal was bound to obey the order of the Secretary of
Justice, who was exercising over him the President's constitutional power of
control.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no question that when he directed
the respondent to reinstate the petitioners, Secretary <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span>
was acting in the regular discharge of his functions as an <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u>
of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His acts should
therefore have been respected by the respondent Director of the National Bureau
of Investigation, which is in the Department of Justice under the direct
control of its Secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a subordinate
in this department, the respondent was (and is) bound to obey the Secretary's
directives, which are presumptively the acts of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It remains to observe that what the petitioners should have done
in the first place was to complain to Secretary <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span>
that his directives for their reinstatement had been disregarded by Director <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus
informed, the Secretary would have reiterated his orders and required immediate
compliance therewith by the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is not to say that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies was strictly required in this case for the petitioners were raising a
pure question of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is one of the
exceptions to the rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even so,
compliance with the usual procedure could have easily obtained for the
petitioners the relief they now seek from this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion is that this regrettable controversy would not
have arisen at all if the respondent had had the humility to recognize the
limits of his authority and acted accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plainly put, Director <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> should have
dutifully obeyed the orders of Secretary <span class="SpellE">OrdoÃ±ez</span> as
his immediate superior in the Department of Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is what we must now order the respondent
to do.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petitions are GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent is hereby ORDERED to
immediately reinstate the petitioners as directed by the Secretary of Justice
in implementation of the challenged orders of the Merit Systems Protection
Board of the Civil Service Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
