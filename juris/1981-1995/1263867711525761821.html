				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The propriety of the reinstatement of private respondents <span style="">as </span>faculty members of petitioner
college is the issue submitted in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">VilIegas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span> were teachers on a <span class="SpellE">probational</span>
basis of the petitioner college.</p>

<p class="BODY">Villegas was initially hired as an instructor in the Nautical
Science Department of said petitioner and was extended an appointment on a
ten-month contractual basis <span style="">which ended
on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3"><span style="">March 31, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon expiration of said contract he re-applied and was given a
new contract commencing on <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1982</st1:date>
and ending on <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter he re-applied for employment and
was given a contract for a fixed period starting <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1983</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon mutual
agreement the <span style="">contract was </span>extended
to include the summer of 1984 up to <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="5">May
 31, 1984</st1:date> which <span style="">is </span>still
part of the school-year 1983-1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon expiration of said period he sent a letter re-applying <span style="">for </span>employment with the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">His application, however, was turned down because of various
complaints from his students borne out by the report of his superiors <span style="">who </span>investigated the matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, he filed a complaint <span style="">in
</span>the Regional Arbitration Office of the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> for illegal dismissal with reinstatement,
payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, moral damages and attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Included in the complaint were
claims for underpayment of salary, allowances, wage orders and his share in
tuition fee increases per Presidential Decree No. 451.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was docketed as NLRC Case no.
RAB-C-0513-84.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span>
was initially hired as a probationary instructor in the High School Department
of petitioner college on <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1981</st1:date>
on a contractual basis to end on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="3">March
 31, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
re-application her contract was renewed for another fixed period covering <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1982</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her employment was on a probationary
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, a third contract was
executed by the petitioner college covering the period starting <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1983</st1:date> and ending on <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the termination of the said third
contract respondent <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span> wrote to petitioner
seeking re-employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her application
was accompanied by a clearance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
her application was denied upon the recommendation of her immediate superiors
who considered her inefficient.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, she filed with the Regional Arbitration Branch of the NLRC
a complaint <span style="">for </span>illegal
dismissal <span style="">with </span>reinstatement,
with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, moral damages and attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also included claims for
underpayment of wages, allowances, wage orders and non-payment of shares in
tuition fee increases per Presidential Decree <span style="">no. </span>451.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was docketed <span style="">as </span>NLRC Case no. RAB-<span style="">C-</span>0560-84.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases of respondents Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span>
<span style="">were j</span>ointly heard <span style="">upon agreement </span>of the parties, the
issues and facts being identical.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their position paper, private respondents Villegas and <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span> alleged that they were dismissed by petitioners
without valid grounds and that they were deprived of their constitutional <span style="">right </span>to due process and security of
tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also raised the issue of
non-compliance with presidential decrees and <span style="">wage orders pertaining </span>to <span style="">the
</span>payment of emergency cost of living allowance (ECOLA) and their basic
salary, including non-payment of their shares in tuition fee increases under
Presidential Decree no. 451.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on the other hand, filed their position paper and
supplemental manifestations wherein they denied that private respondents were
illegally dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They maintained
that the private respondents alleged employment contracts on a probation basis
expired and that the same were not renewed because their performances <span style="">were </span>considered unsatisfactory while
they were on probation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
further contended that private respondents, as probationary employees, did not
qualify for <span class="SpellE">tenureship</span> as their services on
probation, upon eval<span style="">u</span>ation, did
not reach the standard prescribed for probationary employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also denied that private
respondents are entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, since they
were not illegally dismissed and asserted that they have been paid their wages,
allowances and their shares in tuition fee increases and that they were not <span style="">entitled to </span>moral damages and
attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1985</st1:date>,
a decision was rendered by Executive Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
<span style="">G. </span><span class="SpellE">Agbuya</span>
dismissing the <span style="">complaint </span>for
illegal dismissal <span style="">based </span>on the
following disquisition:</p>

<blockquote>“From the above-quoted portion of the parties’ position paper it is
<span style="">undisputed </span><span style="">that Complainants were hired on a </span><span style="">ten </span><span style="">(10) months contractual basis as faculty members for a period </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">three (3) consecutive contracts of employment (school year).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on these facts </span><span style="">alone, the complaint </span><span style="">for </span><span style="">illegal dismissal should be dismissed because it is judicial knowledge
that probationary period of instructors or faculty members of any particular
school pursuant to the rules of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">for three (3) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
employment of Complainants fall (sic) within </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">probationary period
of three (3) years, it is therefore management's prerogative whether to</span> <span style="">renew the same </span>f<span style="">or permanency or stop the relationship as
what happened in this particular cases (sic).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We are limiting the basis </span><span style="">of
our opinion </span><span style="">on the probationary
period provided for by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports and need
not discuss the merits as argued by both parties in their respective position
paper (sic)." (pp.211 - 212, </span>Records)."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents appealed said decision to the NLRC which
rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1989</st1:date>
modifying the appealed decision in this manner:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful review of the records and based on<span style=""> </span>the foregoing facts, we find and so
hold that the Labor Arbiter committed reversible error.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is an undisputed fact that complainant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
Villegas worked with respondent <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> Capitol
College for six (6) consecutive regular semesters, <span style="">as </span>college instructor, while complainant <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span> worked with the same respondent for three
(3) consecutive years as classroom teacher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this regard, the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools
expressly provides that <span style="">'xxx
probationary period for academic personnel shall not be more than xxx six (6) </span>consecutive
regular semesters for those in the tertiary level'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 102 of the Manual, <span style="">7th Edition, 1984).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same Manual also provides that 'full-time
teachers who have </span>rendered <span style="">three </span>(3)
consecutive years of <span style="">satisfactory
service shall </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">considered </span>permanent<span style="">'</span> (Section 75, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Based on this Manual of Regulations of Private Schools both
complainants obtained permanent status in their appointment with the respondent
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype></st1:place> and cannot be dismissed
except for cause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The non-renewal of
their employment contract with the respondent is therefore tantamount to
illegal dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, complainants
are entitled to <span style="">reinstatement </span>with
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and other benefits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As regards the claim for moral and exemplary damages, we concur
with the findings of the Labor Arbiter that the same is without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We likewise adopt the award of <span style="">attorney's fees of 10% out of the total
monetary award that complainants may receive.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby MODIFIED, declaring
respondents guilty of illegal dismissal and <span style="">ordering </span>respondents <span style="">to
reinstate complainants to their former position or any equivalent position with
three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification or </span><span style="">deduction.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondents are likewise ordered to pay 10% of the total award as
attorney’s fee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The claims for moral and exemplary damages <span style="">are </span>dismissed for lack of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioners but this
was denied by the public respondent in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence this petition wherein petitioners <span style="">assail

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE HON. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS <span style="">COMMISSION </span>COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AND SERIOUSLY
ERRED IN INTERPRETING THE PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF THE MANUAL OF REGULATIONS FOR

RENEWING THE TEACHING CONTRACTS OF PRIVATE RESPONDENTS IS TANTAMOUNT TO ILLEGAL
DISMISSAL AND IN CONSEQUENTLY ORDERING THEIR REINSTATEMENT WITH B<span style="">ACK </span>WAGES."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the same petition is <span style="">a </span>prayer
for the issuance of <span style="">a </span>writ of
preliminary injunction to restrain the public respondent from enforcing the
questioned decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1989</st1:date>
pending resolution of the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
sum, the petitioner prays for the annulment of said decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1989</st1:date> and the resolution dated
<st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1989</st1:date> promulgated
by the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the petition, the Court, on October 4, 1989, without
giving due course to the petition, required the respondents to comment thereon
within ten (10) days from notice and issued a temporary restraining order
enjoining the public respondent from enforcing the questioned decision and
resolution and further required petitioner to file <span style="">a </span>bond in the amount of P<span style="">20,000.00
</span>within forty-eight (48) hours from <span style="">notice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After careful deliberation on the petition, the comment thereto
of respondents and the memoranda of the parties, the Court finds <span style="">that </span>the petition is impressed with
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that private respondents were probationary
teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they are covered by the <span style="">policy </span>instructions issued by the
Department of Labor and <span style="">Employment </span><span style="">that the probationary employment of
professional instructors and teachers shall be subject to the standards
established by </span>the Department of Education and Culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said standards are embodied in paragraph 75
of the Manual of Regulations <span style="">for </span>Private
Schools, as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"75. Full time teachers who have rendered three (3)
consecutive years of satisfactory services shall be considered permanent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <st1:place><st1:placetype><u>University</u></st1:placetype><u>

rule, held that the legal requisites for a teacher to acquire permanent
employment and security of tenure are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1) The teacher is a full time <span style="">teacher;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(2) The teacher must have rendered three (3)
consecutive years of service; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(3)<span style=""> </span>Such service must have been satisfactory."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no <span style="">question that </span>private
respondents have been employed for three (3) consecutive years as teachers at <span class="SpellE">petitioners's</span> college and <span style="">on a </span>full time basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, they do not automatically become permanent unless it is shown
that their services <span style="">during the </span>probationary
period were satisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of respondents that upon termination of the <span style="">three-year </span>probationary period the
teacher automatically becomes permanent is not quite correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be conditioned on the compliance with
the third requisite that the services of said teacher during the probationary
period was satisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer is the one who is to <span style="">set </span>the standards and determine whether or not the services of an
employee are satisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the
prerogative <span style="">of </span>an employer to <span style="">determine whether </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">not the said standards have been complied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">right of the employer
to shorten the probationary period if he is impressed with the services of the
employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This prerogative of a school to provide standards for its
teachers and to determine whether or not these standards have been met <span style="">is </span>in accordance with academic freedom
and constitutional autonomy which <span style="">give </span>educational
institution the right to choose who should <span style="">teach.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the start of their employment, private respondents were duly
furnished the Faculty Manual expressly stating among others, <span style="">the duties </span>of teachers and <span style="">the </span>grounds for <span style="">termination of employment or non-appointment to permanent status of a
probationary employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of respondent Villegas, it appears that there were
complaints of students during <span style="">his last
year </span>of service and that these complaints were duly investigated by the
Acting Dean of the Nautical Department who came up with <span style="">the</span> report of <span style="">the </span>acts
complained of.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, his performance was considered unsatisfactory and was not
renewed by petitioner college after the <span style="">third
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">That he was made to teach in the summer of 1984 appears to be prompted
by the fact that the summer sessions </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">still part of the </span><span style="">third probationary </span><span style="">period which started in July of the first
semester of school year 1981-82.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, respondent <span class="SpellE">Pagapong</span> was
found to be inefficient due to her absences.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <span style="">thus </span>finds
and <span style="">so </span>holds that private <span style="">respondents were n</span>ot <span style="">illegally dismissed by petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED and the
