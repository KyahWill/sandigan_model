review of the Resolution of the Court of Appeals dated October 2, 1986 and
November 5, 1986 in CA-G.R. CV No. 08119 declaring appellants' Brief filed by
herein petitioners to have been filed out of time and denying their motion for

<p class="BODY">It appears that in Civil Case No. 3837-M, Branch 132 of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> rendered judgment
dismissing plaintiff Segundo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>’ complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of title against Andres <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
and others.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the Resolution of <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1985</st1:date>,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> directed the ventilation of the proceedings in

notice of appeal was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1986</st1:date>, petitioners were notified by the
respondent Court of Appeals to pay the docket fee and on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1986</st1:date>, petitioners were required to file
appellants' brief within forty-five (45) days from receipt thereof, copy of
which was received by petitioners on <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioners filed their first motion for extension of time for thirty (30) days
counted from <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1986</st1:date>
within which to file their brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said

for another period of thirty (30) days on the ground that petitioners' counsel
is suffering from asthma and hypertension and that their brief has not yet been
completely finished in draft form.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Per
Resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1986</st1:date>,
respondent court granted the motion counted from notice thereof copy of which
was received by petitioners, counsel on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, on <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1986</st1:date>, two (2) days before
the expiration of the 30-day period granted, petitioners filed their last
motion for extension of time praying for fifteen (15) days counted from notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1986</st1:date>,
before said motion was resolved, petitioners filed their brief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="10">October
 2, 1986</st1:date>, respondent Court of Appeals denied petitioners’<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>motion for last extension in the
resolution which reads <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Before Us for resolution is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a ‘</span>Motion For <u>Last</u> <u>Extension</u>
to File Appellant's Brief, filed on July 21, 1986 praying for a 15-day
extension from July 23, 1986 within which to file appellant's brief.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It appears, however, that while the same remained unresolved,
appellant filed his brief only on <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1986</st1:date>, or 18 days beyond the period of extension prayed for by
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other motion for extension
was filed thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appellant's brief is hereby considered filed out of
time and is ordered expunged from the record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The appeal of plaintiff is ordered DISMISSED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1986</st1:date>, but it <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>denied per Resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="11">November 5, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of the petitioners that respondent court erred
in considering their appellants' brief to have been filed out of time whereas
it was filed before their motion for last extension of time <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners argue further that since their
motion which prayed for fifteen days extension counted from notice is in line
with the previous resolutions of the respondent court, then their last motion
for extension of time should not have been denied <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>there was no intention on their part to delay or prejudice
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' argument is predicated upon the theory that whenever
respondent court grants their motion for extension of time it was always made
to begin from receipt of notice of the resolution despite their prayer that it
be granted counted from the date prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to Section 15, Rule 46 of the Revised Rules of Court, an
"extension of time for the filing of briefs will not be allowed except for
good and sufficient cause, and only if the motion for extension is filed before
the expiration of the time sought to be extended".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Allowance or denial of motions for extension
of time to file briefs is addressed to the sound discretion of the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no question that the discretion vested in the courts whether to grant
or not motions for extensions must be exercised wisely and prudently, never
capriciously, with a view to substantial justice.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before Us, it is Our considered view and We so hold
that the Resolutions assailed by herein petitioners are products of respondent
court's sound exercise of its discretion, considering the peculiar
circumstances of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reference is
hereby made that from the time of the rendition of the decision appealed from
dated July 19, 1985, up to the time of filing of the appellants' brief on
August 25, 1986, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>period of
402 days lapsed or counted from March 18, 1986, the date of petitioners'
receipt of notice requiring them to file their brief up to the time of filing
160 days lapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Examining the brief
filed by herein petitioners it appears however that it consists of twenty-six
(26) pages only with simple narration of facts and discussions of the issues.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Any <span class="SpellE">practising</span> lawyer knows that twenty (20) days is
more than sufficient to complete the printing of brief of such length including
its proof-reading.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It is known among every <span class="SpellE">practising</span> lawyer that the
policy of the Court of Appeals is to limit the second extension of time to file
briefs to twenty (20) days.<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">8</span></span> Said policy
was relaxed further by the respondent Court by giving sixty (60) days extension
on the basis of the plea of petitioners' counsel that he was suffering from
asthma even if said plea appears to be self-serving as it <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>not even accompanied by a
doctor's certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners abused
the laxity extended them by the respondent Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They even prayed that the extension of
fifteen (15) days be counted from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lawyers should not presume that the courts would grant their motion for
extension more so to expect that if ever granted it would always be counted
from notice thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the petition to review the assailed resolutions must
fail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let this serve as warning among
members of the Philippine bar who take their own sweet time with their cases if
not purposely delay its progress for no cogent reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not credit to their standing in the
profession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More so when they do not
file the required brief or pleading until their motion is acted upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only should they not presume that their
motion for extension of time will be granted by the court much less should they
expect that the extension that maybe granted shall be counted from notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They should file their briefs or pleadings
within the extended period requested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Failing in this, they have only themselves to blame if their appeal or
case is dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">remises
