<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 10pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">7. <u>RESOLUTION</u></span></i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in this opinion's opening <span style="">p</span>aragraph, the petitioners raise only one issue, and that is,
"WHETHER OR NOT DINOPOL AND BUNGUBUNG ARE ENTITLED TO IMMEDIATE
REINSTATEMENT AND PAYMENT OF BACK WAGES PENDING ADJUDICATION BY THE HONORABLE
COURT OF APPEALS OF THE CASES ON THEIR MERITS," an issue to which they
propose a negative answer.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
According to them, the question turns on the proper interpretation of Section
42 of PD 807 prescribing the maximum period of preventive suspension, and
specifying the instances when "delay of the disposition of the case, **
due to default, negligence or petition of the respondent, ** (may be deducted
from) the period of suspension."</p>

<p class="BODY">Said provision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 42.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i><span style="">Lifting of Preventive Suspension Pending
Administrative Investigation.</span></i><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- </span>When the administrative case against
the officer or employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by
the disciplining authority within the period of ninety (90) days after the date
of suspension of the respondent who is not a presidential appointee, the
respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the service:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That when the delay of the
disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the
respondent, the period of delay shall not be counted in computing the period of
suspension herein provided."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The law evidently considers that a "period of ninety (90)
days" is time enough for the investigation and adjudication of an
administrative case, counted from "the date of suspension of the
respondent who is not a presidential appointee." This will include not
only the filing of required or permitted pleadings and the <span style="">reception </span>of testimonial, documentary
and object evidence, but also the consideration and resolution of incidental
motions filed in good faith, with no intent to delay the disposition of the
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigating officer is expected
to exert and maintain control of the case to ensure, within the time thus
appointed, the orderly and full ventilation of the parties' positions and the
expeditious progress and ultimate adjudication of the proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the investigating officer fail in this
function and is thus unable to decide the case within ninety (90) days, or the
difficulty or complexity of the case, or other fortuitous cause, precludes
decision thereof within said period, reinstatement of the suspended respondent
becomes mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the law makes clear that when the delay in the disposition of the case results
from the suspended respondent's (1) fault, (2) negligence or (3) petition, the
period of such delay is not counted in the <span style="">computation </span>of the 90-day period.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, where the delay is caused by the respondent's absence at
scheduled hearings, or requests for postponement, the time of delay is deducted
in reckoning the period of suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was held in <span class="SpellE"><i>Panti</i></span><i> v. Alberto</i>,
106 Phil. 181.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is apparent that the hearing has suffered several
interruptions due to the requests for postponement of appellant or to his
absence, and that in spite of such delay, the Provincial Board kept on
resetting the <span class="SpellE">hearinguntil</span> it finally acted on the
case on <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1957</st1:date>, the decision was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It we were to deduct from the whole period
that transpired from the first day of the hearing set on September 12, 1957 to
October 21, 1957, date of the decision, the period consumed by the several <span class="SpellE">interuptions</span> which can only be attributed to appellant, the
result would be that only seventeen (17) days had elapsed <span style="">of </span>the 30-day limit fixed by law (at
the time).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would therefore appear
that, when these two cases were filed by appellant, his suspension was still
within the limit of the law and hence it cannot be pretended that Gov. Alberto
has acted arbitrarily on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
find therefore no merit on this claim of appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Diaz </i><i><span style="">v.</span>
<span class="SpellE">Arca</span></i>, 15 SCRA 183, the period of suspension <span style="">was </span>deemed interrupted not only by
postponements obtained by the suspended respondent, but also by a preliminary
injunction issued at the latter's instance forbidding action on the
administrative case until further orders.</p>

<blockquote>"* * * From <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="3">March 5,
 1962</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1962" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1962</st1:date>
is 60 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since Coral asked
for 15 days' postponement, the 60-day period would have ended on <st1:date year="1962" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as he asked for postponement on <st1:date year="1962" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1962</st1:date>, the 60-day period was
again interrupted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on June 21,
1962, when he filed the case at bar, he asked for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction to enjoin further action on the administrative case
until the final determination of the instant case, and said petition having
been granted, the 60-day period was again suspended until such time as the
injunction should have been lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
time has not yet come.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the
suspension of Coral has not yet exceeded the 60-day <span style="">period.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, the filing by a
suspended respondent of a motion to dismiss, the consideration and resolution
of which prevented earlier scheduling of the hearing on his administrative
case, was ruled in <span class="SpellE"><i>Equizabal</i></span><i> v. <span class="SpellE">Maleniza</span></i>, 22 SCRA 24 as delay of his own causing.</p>

<blockquote>"Regarding the delay in setting for hearing on the merits
Administrative Case No. 4, the same appears to be partly due to petitioner
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent alleged, and
petitioner does not deny, that on <st1:date year="1965" day="18" month="3">March
 18, 1965</st1:date>, he moved for the dismissal of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's own ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
motion here for preliminary <span style="">injunction
against the administrative hearing set on May 28, 1965, confirms the existence
of said motion to dismiss, the preliminary disposition of which would again
temporarily divert the attention of the provincial board from the merits of the
pending case."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In light of these rulings, it is not difficult to conclude that
restraining orders or preliminary injunctions inhibiting proceedings in an
administrative case, obtained by the suspended respondents from courts of
justice (such as those obtained <span style="">by </span>the
private respondents) interrupt the 90-day period of preventive suspension and
should be excluded in the reckoning of its permissible duration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bungubung's</span> preventive suspension
commenced, according to him, on <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1988</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1989</st1:date> a
temporary restraining order was issued on his application in G.R. Nos. 86468-­69
"enjoining all respondents (i.e., Sec. Reyes, et al.) from further
proceeding in Administrative Case No. AAB-0310-88 ** and Case No. <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="11">11-01-88</st1:date>." The restraining order
continues in effect until this day; hence, from <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1989</st1:date>, the administrative cases against <span class="SpellE">Bungubung</span> have not moved, have remained frozen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the restraining order cannot be taken into account in computing the length
of <span class="SpellE">Bungubung's</span> preventive suspension thus far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It thus results that for purposes of
determining whether or not the 90-day maximum fixed for the allowable <span class="SpellE">duation</span> of preventive suspension has been reached, the time
of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the restraining order should be
excluded, i.e., from January 26, 1989 to date.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Bungubung</span> must be deemed to
have been under preventive suspension only from <st1:date year="1988" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1988</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1989</st1:date>, a period of fifty-two (52) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are therefore thirty-eight (38) more
days still remaining of his preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>, on the other hand, was placed
under preventive suspension in two (2) separate administrative cases and on
different dates:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, on <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1988</st1:date> as re<span style="">g</span>ards Adm. Case AAB-006-88; and second,
on <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1988</st1:date> in
relation to Adm. Case AAB-016-88.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1988</st1:date>, he succeeded in
getting a temporary restraining order from the Regional Trial Court enjoining
herein <span style="">petitioners (Secretary </span>Reyes,
et al.) "to desist from continuing the proceedings of the Administrative
Action Board in whatever stage it is presently situated and to observe status
quo on the situation of (<span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>) prior to his
suspension, for a period of twenty (20) days from receipt date or unless
otherwise directed by Court during said period."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Although the order ceased to have any force and effect after <span style="">twenty </span>(20) days, or after December 27,
1988, it was nevertheless shortly replaced by an order of injunction on January
9, 1988 which reiterated the order for the petitioners to desist from
proceeding with the administrative cases against <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>
and, additionally, directed them to reinstate <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>
to his former position of "Port Manager of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>"
and to pay him back salaries and other emoluments during his preventive
suspension.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Now, the effective period of the
restraining order and preliminary injunction -- preventing any movement in the
administrative cases against <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span> -- i.e., from <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1988</st1:date> to the present,
cannot be included in the computation of the length of <span class="SpellE">Dinopol's</span>
preventive suspension. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>In other words,
for all intents and purposes, <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span> was under
preventive suspension -</p>

<p class="BODY">1) in Case AAB 006-88, from <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1988</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1988</st1:date>, or for a total period of 103 days; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) in Case AAB 016-88, from <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1988</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1988</st1:date>, or 79 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus results that while the period of preventive suspension in
Case AAB 006-88 has run out, more than ninety (90) days thereof having elapsed,
there are still eleven (11) days remaining of the term of preventive suspension
in Case AAB 016-88.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the lapse of the balance of the period of their preventive
suspension, <span class="SpellE">Bungubung</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>
shall of course have the right to reinstatement, for this is mandate of the
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not, however, entitled to
the payment of back salaries during the period of their preventive suspension
not exceeding ninety days (not counting any delay chargeable to them, as
already pointed out), except if they are ultimately exonerated of the
accusations against them.</p>
