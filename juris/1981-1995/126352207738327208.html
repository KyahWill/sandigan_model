This is a petition for review of the resolutions of the former Court of 
Appeals in C.A. - G.R. No. 41119-R (Ernesto Oppen, Inc. vs. Luis Sia 
Realty Enterprise and Luis Sia Siong Peck) dismissing petitioner's 
appeal from the decision of the Court of First Instance of Manila.
<p>
The case originated from a complaint for recovery of a sum of money 
filed by Ernesto Oppen, Inc. in the Court of First Instance of Manila 
against Luis Sia Realty Enterprise and Luis Sia Siong Peck.  After the 
issues had been joined by the filing of an answer with counterclaim by 
the defendants and the reply thereto by the plaintiff, pre-trial was 
held.  For failure to appear at the pre-trial, the plaintiff was 
declared non-suited.
</p><p>
After presentation of evidence ex-parte by the defendants, the trial 
court rendered a decision awarding moral damages, attorney's fees and 
costs to the defendants.  Both parties moved for reconsideration of the 
decision; but the same was denied.
</p><p>
The plaintiff then filed its notice of appeal from the decision 
simultaneously with a motion for extension of the period within which to
 file the record on appeal and appeal bond.  Within the extension 
sought, plaintiff filed the record on appeal and appeal bond.  
Thereafter, the trial court issued an order denying plaintiff's motion 
for extension and accordingly disapproved the record on appeal and 
appeal bond for having been filed out of time.  The ground for the 
denial of the motion for extension was, it was filed one day late.  
Subsequently, however, upon plaintiff's filing a motion for 
reconsideration showing that the late filing of the motion for extension
 was caused by the illness of its counsel's filing clerk, the trial 
court reconsidered its denial of the motion for extension and, in due 
course, approved the appeal bond and re-amended record on appeal after 
hearing.
</p><p>
After the appeal had been docketed in the Court of Appeals, the 
appellees (respondents) moved to dismiss the appeal, invoking once more 
appellant's (petitioner) failure to file the appeal bond and record on 
appeal on time.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion and affirmed it
 on motion for reconsideration, from which the present petition has been
 taken by the petitioner.
</p><p>
There is no question that petitioner incurred delay in filing the motion
 for extension of time in the lower court.  But the delay was only for 
one day and there was a justifiable reason, duly established, for it.  
Moreover, no one was prejudiced by the delay; and when the lower court 
was called upon to act on the motion, the record on appeal and appeal 
bond had already been filed.  The lower court, therefore, acted 
correctly in reconsidering its denial of the motion for extension of 
time within which to file the record on appeal and appeal bond, so as to
 give due course to petitioner's appeal.  This action was in line with 
the oft-stated exhortation of this Court that judges should as much as 
possible lean in favor of deciding cases on the basis of merits in the 
interest of substantial justice rather than through the invocation of 
technicalities.
</p><p>
Conversely, the defunct Court of Appeals erred when it interfered with 
the proper exercise of judicial discretion by the trial court in giving 
due course to the appeal.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the assailed resolutions of the Court of Appeals dismissing 
the appeal in C.A. - G.R. No. 41119-R (Ernesto Oppen, Inc., 
plaintiff-appellant, vs. Luis Sia Siong Peck, defendants-appellees) are 
hereby set aside.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J., (Chairman)</em>, no part.
