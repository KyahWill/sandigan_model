convicting appellants of the crime of murder, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, finding the accused Salvador Fernandez

defined under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

indemnify the heirs of the deceased the amount of P12,000.00; to pay P15,000.00
or as moral and exemplary damages, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of

<p class="BODY">Appellants were indicted by the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> for the crime of murder defined and penalized under
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, in <span class="GramE">an in­formation</span>
dated <st1:date year="1959" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1959</st1:date>
(Records, p. 30) stat­ing that the crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 20th day of October, 1959, in the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Libon</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, Philip­pines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating together
and mutually helping one another for a common purpose, with evident pre­meditation,
treachery and with delibe­rate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">intent </span>to
kill, and being then armed with deadly weapons, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>two (2) bolos and two (2) firearms, did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and fe­loniously shoot, attack and hack with
the said firearms and bolos one POR­FIRIO CANANEA thereby inflicting upon him
fatal wounds which directly caused the <span class="SpellE">spontaeous</span>
death of the said PORFIRIO CANANEA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That in the commission of the crime, the following aggravating cir­cumstances
were present:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. Superior strength</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. <span class="GramE">use</span> of vehicle (jeep)</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. <span class="GramE">cruelty</span> by deliberately and inhumanly
augmenting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the suffering of the vic­tims.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">CONTRARY TO LAW."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the accused were granted bail of P30,000.00, in an order of
the trial court, the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, Branch
I, dated April 28, 1960 (Orig. Records, pp. 119-120).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment on <st1:date year="1960" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1960</st1:date> all the accused pleaded "not
guilty" to the offense charged (Orig. Records, p. 147).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 27, 1962, Mrs. Maria <span class="SpellE">Cananea</span>,
the widow sent a letter to the Secretary of Justice, seeking early disposition
of the case and complaining of its continuous postponement (Orig. Records, p.
262) and on February 5, 1962, a telegram to the Office of the Pre­sident,
requesting investigation of the delay in the disposition of the case and
complaining among others, of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the loss of interest </span>by the trial court (Orig. Records, p.
312).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said court reacted by ordering the
widow to show cause why she should not be held in contempt (Orig. Records, p.
315).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the case had
already been set for trial when the widow sent her letter to the Secretary of
Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court exonerated the
widow, considering her fairly satisfactory explanation (Orig. Records, p. 320).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the hearing on September 11, 1963 the case was tried
jointly with Criminal Cases Nos. 2594 and 2657 and later on, also with Criminal
Case No. 2632 in view of the manifestation by the defense counsel that the
prosecu­tion witnesses and evidences in Criminal Cases Nos. 2594 and 2657 be
also considered as defense witnesses and evidence in Criminal Case No. 2772
although the victim in Criminal Case No. 2772 had nothing to do nor was
implicated in any manner in the other cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Thus the delay in the trial of the case, according to
the observation of the Judge of Branch VIII of the Court who penned the
appealed decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 1138).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the trial of the case one of the
accused, Herman Fernandez, died (Orig. Records, p. 603).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 8, 1976 Alexander <span class="SpellE">Cananea</span>,
son of the victim in Criminal Case No. 2772, wrote the President ask­ing for
the early disposition of the case (Orig. Records, p. 934).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letter was forwarded by the Court to the
Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
in a 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated December 14, 1976 (Orig.
Records, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">p. 32).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was finally promulgated on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1984</st1:date> (Orig. Records, p. 1186).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same date the bonds filed by the
accused were cancelled (Orig. Records, p. 1185) and the accused taken into
custody as detention prisoners (Orig. Records p. 1187) considering that the
judgment is one of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1981</st1:date>
accused filed a motion for re­consideration (Orig. Records, p. 1188) which was
denied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">by the lower court in its Order

still aboard their hired jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, appellants cooperated and labored to the same end - the death
of the victim, leaving no doubt of the existence of conspiracy in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In People v. Garcia (94 SCRA 14 [1979]) the Court said that when
a group of men more or less give chase to a single unarmed individual running
for his life and they overtake him and inflict wounds on his body by means of
shooting, stabbing, hitting with pieces of wood, there is conspiracy to kill;
and it does not detract from their status as conspirators that there is no
evidence of previous agreement, it being sufficient that their wills have
concurred and they labored to achieve the same end.</p>

<p class="BODY">To properly appreciate evident premeditation, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">is </span>necessary to establish proof, as
clear as the evidence of the crime itself about (1) the time when the offender
determined to commit the crime; (2) an act manifestly indi­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">cating </span>that the culprit had clung to
his determination; and (3) a sufficient lapse of time between the determina­tion
and the execution to allow him to reflect (People v. Johnson, 103 SCRA 530
[1981]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Guiapar</span>, 129 SCRA 539 [1984]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To qualify the killing there should have been
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">proof that the appellants had met the
night before, discussed among themselves, and agreed to kill their </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">victim </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

purpose of discussing and agreeing among themselves to kill the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The element of sufficient lapse of time
between the determination and execution of the criminal act to afford the culprits
full opportunity for calm <span class="SpellE">relfection</span> on the
consequences of the crime committed, had not been established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Only one circumstance, however, is necessary to qualify an
offense as murder (People v. <span class="SpellE">Dueño</span>, 90 SCRA 23
[1979]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While evident premeditation may
not have been established, treachery which qualifies the killing to murder has
been amply proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attack made on <span class="SpellE">Peo­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">firio</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Cananea</span> was

alighted from the bus unaware that he would be attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he was first shot by Ernesto he was not
given any opportunity to defend himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is treachery in a sudden and unexpected attack which renders the
victim un­able to defend himself by reason of the suddenness and severity of
the attack (People v. <span class="SpellE">Carzano</span>, 95 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">SCRA 146 [</span>1983]; People v. Beltran, 137

the consummation of the act (People v. <span class="SpellE">Gatcho</span>, 103
SCRA 207 [1981]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the victim was
shot three (3) times and hacked several times until he died, the infliction of
the wounds was continuous rather than slow and gradual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inflicting various succes­sive wounds upon a
person to cause his death without appre­ciable time intervening between the
infliction of one wound and that of another, as in the present case, does <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not constitute cruelty (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, 139 SCRA 115 [1985]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
