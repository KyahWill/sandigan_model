				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking the
reversal of the March 21, 1984 decision of the Special Appellate Committee of
the National Police Commission affirming in all respects the June 3, 1977
decision in Administrative Case No. 77-0572 of <span style="">Adjudication Board No. 13 </span>of the same Commission finding the
petitioner guilty of grave misconduct and dismissing him from the service with
prejudice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual background of the case as summarized by the Special
Appellate Committee of the NAPOLCOM is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the evening of <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="9">September
 6, 1976</st1:date>, Manuel 'Boy' <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> had an
appointment at the Disco 2000 with Romeo <span class="SpellE">Lavilla</span>, an
accountant of the DBP <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Branch regarding a
fishing loan which the former had applied <span style="">for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Lavilla</span> <span style="">arrived in </span>the said Disco at <st1:time minute="40" hour="8">8:40</st1:time> in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Lavilla</span> had
ascertained that <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> had not yet arrived he sat in
one of the stools at the bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 20
minutes later, Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Raga along with Gary <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span> and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torrato</span>
entered the Disco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lavilla</span>
greeted the three.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the invitation
of <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lavilla</span> joined
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
then ordered a <span style="">half </span>bottle of <span class="GramE">scotch</span> whisky and the group started drinking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"About a half hour later, Manuel ‘Boy’ <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
and his driver Jose <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> and <span class="SpellE">Porras</span> upon the invitation of <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
likewise joined the latter's table.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Within the next <span style="">half </span>hour
Nelson <span class="SpellE">Chuatico</span> and Gene <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span>,
came in one after the other, 10 to 15 minutes apart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also joined <span class="SpellE">Hipolito</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lacson's</span> group.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At past <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Remo's</span> group composed of <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span>, Lopez and Carlos '<span class="SpellE">Otik</span>'
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Benares</span></st1:place> son of then <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City Mayor Carlos <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Benares</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> came in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing 'Boy' <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>,
Lopez went to his table and shook hands with him while <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span>
stood nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
and '<span class="SpellE">Otik</span>' <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Benares</span></st1:place>
went straight to a vacant table near the corner on the bar side of the <span style="">Disco.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>While Lopez and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> were conversing <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> proceeded to the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <span class="SpellE">Lacson's</span> table
Lopez <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> to <span class="SpellE">Remo's</span>
table but saw Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Leonardia</span> the Manager of the
Disco 2000 and they talked to each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u><span style="">At</span></u> <u><span style="">this</span></u> <u>juncture</u> <u><span style="">Pat.</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>Jaculina</u></span> <u>had</u></span> <u><span style="">already</span></u> <u><span style="">joined</span></u> <u><span style="">Pat</span>.</u>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u><span style="">Remo</span></u></span></span><span class="GramE"> <u><span style="">in</span></u> <u><span style="">drinking</span></u> <u><span style="">beer</span>.</u></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span> then
told <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> of <span class="SpellE">Remo's</span>
presence but 'Boy' assured him that nothing is going to happen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this instance, Lopez left <span class="SpellE">Leonardia</span>
and called up by telephone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> also left his table and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span>
likewise stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">At
that moment Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> was walking casually
towards Boy's table, <span style="">while </span>the
dance was going on and the attention of most was focused at the dance
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the right side of
'Boy', Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> who was <span class="SpellE">lefthanded</span>
called 'Boy, Boy' and in a split-second of Boy's looking at Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Remo</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> was
gunned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The movement was fast at
this point.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"As Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
fired at Boy, <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span> was split-second late in
noticing it but instantly he stood up to grab the gun of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> but was <span style="">parried
</span>by the latter who stepped back and was fired at.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span> was hit
and fell back on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> again fired at Boy, and <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span>
again stood up and tried to grab the gun of <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> but
the latter again stepped back and fired at <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> then
fired again at the slumped body of Boy, and again, <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span>
stood up and went after Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> but was hit again
by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span>
fell on the floor.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"After<span style=""> </span>the
shooting, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> stepped out of the Disco
followed by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Jaculina</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two took a PU
in front of the <span class="SpellE">Sugarland</span> Hotel and later surrendered
to the police authorities at the house of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Benares</span>."
<span class="GramE">(Decision, Annex "D" of Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 38-42; Underscoring supplied).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Castandielo</span> survived the shooting but <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> died <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the incident, herein petitioner Salvador <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> and Nelson <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> were
administratively charged with grave misconduct (violation of General Orders
Nos. 6 and 7 <span style="">in </span>conjunction with
Presidential Decree No. 9 or illegal possession of firearm with murder and
frustrated murder) by respondent Atty. Pablo S. <span style="">Villanueva, in his </span>official capacity as Chief of the
Investigation Division of the National Police <span style="">Commission (NAPOLCOM, for brevity), with the Office of the Hearing
Officer of the NAPOLCOM at <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 21-22).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
criminal complaint was also filed in the military court for illegal possession
of firearm with murder and frustrated murder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In said criminal case, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> was
acquitted while Nelson <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> was meted the mandatory
penalty of death by a firing squad (Annexes 'A', 'B' and 'B-1'; Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 16-20).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the administrative complaint was duly served on the
petitioner who chose not to file an answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, a formal <span style="">investigation
was conducted because under the <span class="SpellE">NAPOLCOM's</span> Rules and
Regulations, petitioner's failure to answer was considered a general denial of
the charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was detained in the PC stockade at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, but the hearings were
scheduled by the Hearing Officer in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During all the five (5) hearings conducted,
petitioner, under military escort, and his counsel were present, except on two
scheduled dates when only his counsel attended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under proper escort, petitioner attended the hearing on <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was supposed to present his evidence but
his counsel moved to hold in abeyance the <span style="">reception
</span>of evidence until the termination of the criminal case in the military
tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied by the
Hearing Officer who ruled that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
criminal case was not a bar to the continuation of the hearing in the
administrative case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His motion for the
reconsideration of such denial having been likewise denied, petitioner's
counsel submitted the case for resolution without proffering evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adjudication Board No. 13, after a thorough study of the records,
rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1977" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1977</st1:date>,
holding thus:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Board finds respondents Patrolmen Nelson<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Remo</span>, Salvador <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> and Joel <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Raga
guilty as charged and are therefore considered DISMISSED FROM SERVICE WITH
PREJUDICE." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
23-28).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration of said decision was
denied on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He appealed to the Special Appellate
Committee of the NAPOLCOM but in its decision of March 21, 1984 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>., pp. 33-42), said committee affirmed the appealed
decision in all respects.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition which <span class="GramE">We</span>
treat <span style="">as </span>a special civil action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of July 24, 1989, the petition was dismissed
for failure to sufficiently show that the respondent Commission had committed
grave abuse of discretion in rendering the questioned judgment <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>p.
118).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on motion <span style="">for reconsideration </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 119-123), the petition was given due course in
the resolution of October 16, 1989 and the parties were required to submit
simultaneously their respective memoranda within thirty (30) days from notice
thereof (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 125).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following issues <span style="">are
raised in the petition, to</span> wit:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not petitioner was deprived of his
constitutional right to due process; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not his administrative culpability
was duly established."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of this petition is that the questioned decision
is null and void because petitioner was deprived of his constitutional right to
due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that he was not afforded the opportunity to
present his evidence as during <span style="">the
hearing of the administrative case in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> </span>City,
he was confined at the PC stockade in Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, which <span class="GramE">is</span> several
miles away from the place of hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also avers that the decision of the National Police Commission appears to be
the product of the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">tayo-tayo</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>system considering that the deceased
Manuel 'Boy' <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> was the son-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Agbayani</span>, the chairman
of the Special Appellate Committee of the NAPOLCOM which rendered the
questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The essence of due process is simply an opportunity to be heard,
or, as applied to administrative proceedings, an opportunity to explain one's
side (<span class="SpellE">Var</span>-Orient Shipping Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Achacoso</span>, 161 SCRA 732, 736 [1988]), an opportunity amply
afforded to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the hearings were conducted on January 19,
1977, January 20, 1977, March 1, 1977, April 18, 1977 and April 20, 1977; and
that except for the hearings on March 1, 1977 and April 18, 1977 when only his
counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Rayfrando</span> Diaz, attended, petitioner
was always present (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 67).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, evident that he was not in
any way, deprived of his substantial and constitutional right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's right to due
process was also bolstered by the fact that he was represented by </span>counsel
(<span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span> v. Cruz, 162 SCRA 642, 651 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact said counsel moved that the reception
of evidence be held in abeyance until the hearing of the criminal case in the
military tribunal is terminated and at the same time invoked his constitutional
right to remain silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
when the Hearing Officer denied said motion as <span style="">well </span><span style="">as petitioner's </span>motion
for reconsideration, petitioner's counsel himself submitted the case for
resolution without adducing his evidence (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably, petitioner is bound
by the action of his counsel <span style="">in </span>the
proceedings in the case and he ca<span style="">nnot
be heard </span>to complain that the result might have been different had he
proceeded differently (<span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> v. Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Branch I, 160 SCRA 352, 358
[1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same vein, petitioner's charge of bias on the part of the
Chairman of <span class="SpellE">NAPOLCOM's</span> Special Appellate Committee is
not persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision
was not arrived at solely by the Chairman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two other members of the Committee concurred thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the <span style="">second issue, </span>that
is, whether or not the <span style="">administrative </span>culpability
of petitioner was duly <span style="">established, </span>it
will be recalled that the administrative complaint filed against petitioner for
grave misconduct was ba<span style="">s</span>ed on
violation of General Orders Nos. 6 and 7 in conjunction with P.D. No. 9 or
illegal possession of firearm with murder and frustrated murder, and that in
the criminal complaint filed in the <span style="">Military
Court for said crimes, petitioner was acquitted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand, the
finding of petitioner's guilt in the administrative complaint by the Special
Appellate Committee is solely anchored on the finding of conspiracy based on
the following circumstances:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
September 6, 1976, appellant <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> came together to Disco 2000;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both of them carried firearms fully loaded;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They occupied one table in drinking beer;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When respondent <span class="SpellE">Remo</span>
left the table to shoot 'Boy' <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> herein appellant
likewise stood up;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After the shooting both of them immediately
stepped out of the Disco;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They took one PU in front of the <span class="SpellE">Sugarland</span> Hotel;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They surrendered to the police authorities at
the house of the City Mayor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a rule
well-entrenched in our jurisprudence that administrative decisions are entitled
to great weight and respect and will not be interfered with by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, however, limits to the exercise of
administrative discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Administrative decisions may be reviewed by the courts upon a showing
that the decision is vitiated by fraud, imposition or <u>mistake</u>
(underscoring supplied) (<span class="SpellE">Greenhills</span> Mining Company v.
Office of the President, 163 SCRA 350 [1988]; Manuel v. <span class="SpellE">Villena</span>,
37 SCRA 745 [1971]; Castaneda v. Court of Appeals, 27 SCRA 186 [1969]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ostensibly, the Special
Appellate Committee erred when it ruled that conspiracy has been sufficiently
established by the </span>circumstances mentioned earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">In the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Saavedra</span> (149 SCRA
610 [1987] citing the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> (47
SCRA 289 [1972]), this Court ruled that "conspiracy presupposes the
existence of a preconceived plan or agreement and in order to establish the
existence of such a circumstance, it is not enough that the persons supposedly
engaged or connected with the same be present when the crime was
perpetrated." In a more recent case, the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Padrones</span> (G.R. No. 85823, September 13, 1990), this Court
stated that "conspiracy transcends companionship." <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Treated against such
standards, conspiracy has not been successfully established in the case under
consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jaculina</span> cannot be absolved from liability under the
prevailing circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this </span>juncture,
while the High Court is not ordinarily a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of
facts, such factor does not preclude it from evaluating the evidence already submitted
to it (Young, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>, G.R. No. 57839, May 9,
1989, <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>, Minute Resolution on a Motion for Clarification).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As found by the NAPOLCOM,
petitioner is guilty of gross misconduct and negligence established by the
facts on record although not </span>on the finding of conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">What is being resolved </span>in
<span style="">this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>case
is petitioner's liability for his acts as a peace </span>officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His acquittal in the criminal case merely
relieved him from criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
did not in any way carry with it relief from administrative liability (Police
Commission v. <span class="SpellE">Lood</span>, 96 SCRA 819 [1980]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A careful review of the
records shows that in the instant case, there are facts </span><span style="">proven </span><span style="">for which petitioner may be held administratively answerable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly culled by the Solicitor General
from the NAPOLCOM findings, the following acts of petitioner subject him to
administrative liability:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an officer of the law, petitioner, failed
to prevent Pat. <span class="SpellE">Remo</span> from gunning down <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, much less arrest him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He instead ran towards the comfort room at
the first burst of gunfire (Annex 'D', p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is a clear act of cowardice in line of duty for which he should
also be held administratively liable.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
is likewise guilty of having taken hard drinks, in this case beer inside a
public place (id., p. 3)." (Comment, p. 9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 72; Memorandum, p. <span style="">13, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 143).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While intoxication under
Section 19 of Rule III of the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct of the
Rules and Regulations Governing the Integrated National Police may be
considered a </span>minor <span style="">offense as it
does not involve moral turpitude, serious neglect of duty under Section </span><span style="">2, </span><span style="">Rule VII of the said Rules and Regulations, is not a minor offense and
therefore, any peace officer who commits it exposes himself to the penalty of
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the penalty of
dismissal imposed on petitioner is not really too harsh for a first offender
since his demonstrated cowardice in this case casts dishonor on his job which
is to enforce the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><b><span style="">PREMISES
CONSIDERED</span></b><span style="">, the decision of
the respondent Special Appellate Committee of the National Police Commission
