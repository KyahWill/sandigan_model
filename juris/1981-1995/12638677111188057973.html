<p class="BODY">From the record, the facts of the case may be collated as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Very early in March 1982, Pfc. Bernardo Gonzales, Chief of the
Anti-Narcotics Unit of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> City Police Force,
was informed by his sources that appellant was involved in selling marijuana
somewhere in <st1:street><st1:address>A.B. Fernandez Avenue, East</st1:address></st1:street>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="3">5 March 1982</st1:date>, Pfc. Gonzales instructed Patrolmen Norman <span class="SpellE">Aperocho</span> and Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Orprecio</span> to
place the appellant under surveillance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Aperocho</span> and <span class="SpellE">Orprecio</span> proceeded
to <st1:street><st1:address>A.B. Fernandez Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
and there they were informed that appellant had been allegedly selling
marijuana leaves to drug addicts in the house of one <span class="SpellE">Cordel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span> in <span class="SpellE">Bani</span> District, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> They went back to their headquarters and conveyed
that information to Pfc. Gonzales.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, Pfc. Gonzales sent a civilian informer to try to
buy marijuana from appellant at the house of <span class="SpellE">Cordel</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
purpose, Pfc. Gonzales gave to the informer the amount of P50.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the house of <span class="SpellE">Cordel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, the informer was able to purchase, allegedly from
appellant, a package of marijuana wrapped in an aluminum foil.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> The informer went back to Police Headquarters and
gave the marijuana to Pfc. Gonzales.</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, on <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="3">6 March
 1982</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning, Pfc. Gonzales again instructed the informer to buy some
marijuana from the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time
Pfc. Gonzales gave to the informer the amount of P100.00 with which to buy the
same.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> The informer once more went to the <span class="SpellE">Cordel</span> <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> house and there he
bought two (2) packages of dried marijuana leaves wrapped in aluminum foil
allegedly from the appellant and he presented these to Pfc. Gonzales upon his
return to Police Headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pfc.
Gonzales in turn showed the same to Lt. P.B. <span class="SpellE">Landingin</span>,
Chief of the Intelligence Unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
police officers decided then to conduct a "buy-bust" operation to
entrap the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, at
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time> of the same day,
Pfc. Gonzales gave to the informer P300.00 in three (3) marked one hundred peso
bills to buy dried marijuana leaves from the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> The bills
bore serial numbers 365681, BQ31724, and BJ194215 which serial numbers were
listed <span style="">upon the direction of Pfc.
Gonzales on a piece of paper and left with the Desk Officer of the police
precinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police team of four (4)
officers and the informer proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Cordel</span>

</span>Pfc. Gonzales, who was at the time intently observing the transaction,
saw the appellant deliver to the informer six (6) packages wrapped in aluminum
foil and the informer hand the marked money to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Pfc. Gonzales emerged from his
hiding place, and arrested appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The six (6) packages were recovered from the informer while the three
(3) marked P100.00 </span><span style="">peso </span><span style="">bills were found in
appellant's pocket.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a><span style=""> Pfc. Gonzales gave the six (6) packages to

<p class="BODY">The fact that the packages of dried leaves confiscated and taken
