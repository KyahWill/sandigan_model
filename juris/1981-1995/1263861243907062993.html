				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The facts of this case are stated in the dissenting opinion of
Justice Carolina C. <span class="SpellE">Grino-Aquino</span> which follows this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">majority opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dissent substantially reiterates the
draft report prepared by </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Grino-Aquino</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>working basis for the Court's
deliberations when the case was being discussed and for the subsequent votes of
concurrence or dissent on the action proposed by the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute over the events which transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The division of the Court is on the
conclusions to be drawn from those events and the facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">insofar as </span>the two petitioners are
concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority is of the v<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">iew </span>that Messrs. Arias and Data should
be acquitted on grounds of reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court feels that the quantum of evidence needed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">convict petitioners </span>Arias and Data
beyond reasonable doubt, as co-conspirators in the conspiracy to cause undue
injury to the Government through the irregular disbursement and expenditure of
public <span class="GramE">funds,</span> has not been satisfied.</p>

<p class="BODY">In acquitting the petitioners, the Court agrees with the
Solicitor General<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
who, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">80 </span>pages of his
consolidated manifestation and motion, recommended that Messrs. Arias and Data
be acquitted of the crime charged, with costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier, <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>
Special Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Eleuterio</span> F. Guerrero had also
recommended the dropping of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Arias </span>from the information <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">before it was </span>filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question about the need to ferret out and convict
public officers whose acts have made the bidding out and construction of public
works and highways synonymous with graft or criminal inefficiency in the public
eye.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the remedy is not to
indict and jail every person who may have ordered the project, who signed a
document incident to its construction, or who had a hand somewhere in its
implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The careless use of the
conspiracy theory may sweep into jail even innocent persons who may have been
made unwitting tools by the criminal minds who engineered the <span class="SpellE">defraudation</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span> decision in
this case, a department secretary, bureau chief, commission chairman, agency
head, and all chief auditors would be equally culpable for every crime arising
from disbursements <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">which they have
approved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The department head or chief </span>auditor
would be guilty of conspiracy simply because he was the last of a long line of
officials and employees who acted upon or affixed their signatures to a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Guilt must be premised on a more knowing, personal, and deliberate
participation of each individual who is charged with others as part of a
conspiracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The records show that the
</span>six <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused persons were
convicted in connection with the overpricing of land purchased by the Bureau of
Public Works for the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> </span>Floodway
Project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The project was intended to
ease the perennial floods in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

13.0pt">, </span>Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused were prosecuted because 19,004 square meters of
"<span class="SpellE">riceland</span>" in <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>
which had been assessed at P5.00 a square meter in 1973 were sold as
"residential land" in 1978 for P80.00 a square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The land for the floodway was acquired
through negotiated purchase.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor-General that the assessor's tax
valuation of P5.00 per square meter of land in <st1:city><st1:place><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rosario</span></u></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pasig</span></u></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><span class="GramE">Metro</span>
Manila is completely unrealistic and arbitrary as the basis for conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein <span class="GramE">lies</span> the first error of the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed that the petitioners are not charged with
conspiracy in the falsification of public documents or preparation of spurious
supporting papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge is causing
undue injury to the Government and giving <span class="GramE">a private party
unwarranted benefits</span> through manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or
inexcusable <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">negligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged undue injury in a nutshell is the Government purchase
of land in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for P80.00 a square meter instead of the P5.00
value per square meter appearing in the tax declarations and fixed by the
municipal assessor, not by the landowner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, without any clear
factual basis for doing so has assumed that the P5.00 per square meter value
fixed by the assessor in the tax declarations was the correct market value of
the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> property and if the Government purchased
the land for P80.00 a square meter, it follows that it must have suffered undue
injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General explains why this conclusion is erroneous:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">"1. <u>No</u> <u>undue</u> <u>injury</u> <u>was</u> <u>caused</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Government</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:67.5pt;text-indent:-.25in">a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u style="text-underline:words">The P80.00 per
square meter acquisition cost is just, fair and reasonable</u>.</p>

<blockquote>It bears stress that the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property
was acquired through negotiated purchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was, <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, nothing more than an
ordinary contract of sale where the purchase price had to be arrived at by
agreement between the parties and could never be left to the discretion of one
of the contracting parties (Article 1473, New Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For it is the essence of a
contract of sale that there must be a meeting of the minds between the seller
and the buyer upon the thing which is the object of the contract and upon the
price (Article 1475, New Civil Code).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Necessarily, the parties have to negotiate the reasonableness of the
price, taking into consideration such other factors as location, potentials,
surroundings and capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
taking the foregoing premises into consideration, the parties have, thus,
arrived at the amount of P80.00 per square meter as the fair and reasonable
price for the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It bears stress that the prosecution failed to adduce evidence to
prove that the true and fair market value in 1978 of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span>
property was indeed P5.00 per square meter only as stated by the assessor in
the tax declaration (Exhibit W).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, the prosecution's principal witness Pedro <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span>,
the Assistant Municipal Assessor of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, admitted
that the purchase price of P80.00 per square meter paid for the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property as stated in the Deed of Sale (Exhibit G)
is 'reasonable' (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 19, 1983, p. 20) and
'fair' (Ibid, p. 76); that ‘the value of lands within the town of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> ranges from P80.00 to P500.00’ (Ibid, P. 21); that
the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property is ‘around 300 meters’ from <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> Avenue, ‘adjacent to the existing <span class="SpellE">Leongson</span> [<span class="SpellE">Liamson</span>] Subdivision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and near Eastland Garment
Building’ (ibid, pp. 12-13); that said property is surrounded by factories,
commercial establishments and residential subdivisions (Ibid, pp. 73-74); that
the P5.00 per square meter assessed valuation of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span>
property appearing on the tax declaration (Exhibit W) was based on actual use
only (Ibid, pp. 26-27), it being the uniform rate for all <span class="SpellE">ricefields</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> irrespective of their locations (Ibid, pp.
72-74) and did not take into account the existence of many factories and
subdivisions in the area (Ibid., pp. 25-27, 72-74), and that the assessed value
is different from and always lower than the actual market value (Ibid, pp.
22-23)." (At pp. 256-259, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A negotiated purchase may usually entail a higher buying price
than one arrived at in the course of expropriation proceedings.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Export</u> <u>Processing</u> <u>Zone</u> <u>Authority</u> <u>v</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Dulay</u></span> (149 SCRA 305, 310 [1987]) we struck down
the martial law decree that pegged just compensation in eminent domain cases to
the assessed value stated by a landowner in his tax declaration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">or </span>fixed by the municipal assessor,
whichever is lower.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other factors must
be considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These factors must be
determined by a court of justice and not by municipal employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the assessor's low valuation, in the fixing
of which the landowner had no <span class="GramE">participation,</span> was used
for a purpose infinitely more weighty than mere expropriation of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It forms the basis for a criminal conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not prepared to say that P80.00 to P500.00 a square
meter for land in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>
in 1978 would be a fair valuation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
value must be determined in eminent domain proceedings by a competent
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are certain, however, that it
cannot be P5.00 a square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the decision, insofar as it says that the "correct" valuation is
P5.00 per square meter and on that basis convicted the petitioners of causing
undue injury, damage, and prejudice to the Government because of gross
overpricing, is grounded on shaky foundations.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">verpricing
</span>for purposes of a criminal conviction where no proof adduced during
orderly proceedings has been presented and accepted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court's decision, however, is based on a more basic
reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herein <span class="GramE">lies</span>
the principal error of the respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of office plagued
by all too common problems - dishonest or negligent subordinates, overwork,
multiple assignments or positions, or plain incompetence - is suddenly swept
into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not personally examine every
single detail, painstakingly trace every step from inception, and investigate the
motives of every person involved in a transaction before affixing his signature
as the final approving authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no question from the records that documents
used in the negotiated sale were falsified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A key tax declaration had a typewritten number instead of being
machine-numbered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The registration <span class="SpellE">stampmark</span> was antedated and the land reclassified as
residential instead of <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But were the petitioners guilty of conspiracy
in the falsification and the subsequent charge of causing undue injury and
damage to the Government?</p>

<p class="BODY">We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have probed
records, inspected documents, received procedures, and questioned persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly
sized office could <u>personally</u> do all these things in all vouchers
presented for his signature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
would be asking for the impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their subordinates and
on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into
negotiations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If a department secretary
entertains important visitors, the auditor is not ordinarily expected to call
the restaurant about the amount of the bill, question each guest whether he was
present at the luncheon, inquire whether the correct amount of food <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>served,
and otherwise <u>personally</u> look into the reimbursement voucher's accuracy,
propriety, and sufficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There has to
be some added reason why he should examine each voucher in such detail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any executive head of even <u>small</u>
government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of papers that must
be signed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are hundreds of
documents, letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that routinely
pass through his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The number in
bigger offices or departments is even more appalling.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should be other grounds than the mere signature or approval
appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy charge and conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Was petitioner Arias part of the planning, preparation, and
perpetration of the alleged conspiracy to defraud the government?</p>

<p class="BODY">Arias joined the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>
office on <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The negotiations for the purchase of the
property started in 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deed of
sale was executed on <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Title was transferred to the Republic on <st1:date year="1978" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the transaction had already
been consummated before his arrival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pre-audit, incident to payment of the purchase, was conducted in the first week
of October, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arias points out that
apart from his signature on the voucher, there is no evidence linking him to
the transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
other co-accused testified they did not know him personally and none approached
him to follow up the payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Should the big amount of P1<span class="GramE">,520,320.00</span>
have caused him to personally investigate the smallest details of the
transaction?</p>

<p class="BODY">Yes, if the land was really worth only P5.00 a square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if land in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> was already worth P80.00 a
square meter at the time, no warning bell of intuition would have sounded an
inner alarm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Land along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> on the way to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> is now worth P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P30,000.00 <u>a</u> <u>square</u> <u>meter</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The falsification of the tax declaration by
changing "<span class="SpellE">riceland</span>" to
"residential" was done before Arias was assigned to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is no such thing as "<span class="SpellE">riceland</span>" in inner Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some lots in outlying or easily flooded areas
may still be planted to rice or <span class="SpellE">kangkong</span> but this is
only until the place is dedicated to its real purpose which is commercial,
industrial, or residential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is going to send somebody to jail for six
years, the decision should be based on firmer foundations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> asked why Arias kept
the documents from October, 1978 to <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arias explained
that the rules of the Commission on Audit require <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">auditors </span>to keep these documents and <u>under</u> <u>no</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>circumstance</u> </span>to relinquish
custody to other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Arias was</span> auditor of the Bureau of Public Works in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> up to <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="9">September <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1, </span>1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The seven months delay in the formal turnover
of custody to the new auditor was explained by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Julito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pesayco</span>, who succeeded him
as auditor and who took over the custody of records in that office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main reason for the judgment of conviction, for the finding
of undue injury and damage to the Government is the alleged gross overprice for
the land purchased for the floodway project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming that P80.00 is indeed exorbitant, petitioner Arias cites his
testimony as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
conducting the pre-audit, did you determine the reasonableness of the price of
the property?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
this case, the price has been stated, the transaction had been consummated and
the corresponding Transfer Certificate of Title had been issued and transferred
to the government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The auditors have no
more leeway to return the papers and then question the purchase price.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
it not a procedure in your office that before payment is given by the
government to private individuals there should be a pre-audit of the papers and
the corresponding checks issued to the vendor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Correct,
Your Honor, but it depends on the kind of transaction there is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
but in this particular case, the papers were transferred to the government
without paying the price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you not
consider that rather odd or unusual?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, page 17, April 27, 1987).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, Your Honor.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
not?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
in the Deed of Sale as being noted there, there is a condition that no payments
will be made unless the corresponding title in the payment of the Republic is
committed is made.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>In</u>
<u>this</u> <u>case</u> <u>you</u> <u>said</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>title</u>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Yes</u>,

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
point is this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you not consider it
unusual for a piece of property to be bought by the government; the sale was
consummated; the title was issued in favor of the government without the price
being paid first to the seller?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General summarizes the participation of petitioner
Data <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As regards petitioner Data's alleged participation, the
evidence on record shows that as the then District Engineer of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Engineering District he created a committee, headed
by <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. <span class="SpellE">Priscillo</span> Fernando
with Ricardo Asuncion, Alfonso Mendoza, <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span>
Cruz, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Hucom</span> and Carlos Jose, all employees of
the district office, as members, specifically to handle the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span>
Floodway Project, gather and verify documents, conduct surveys, negotiate with
the owners for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sale </span>of their lots, process claims and prepare the necessary
documents; he did not take any direct and active part in the acquisition of
land for the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> floodway; it was the committee
which determined the authenticity of the documents presented to them for
processing and on the basis thereof prepared the corresponding deed of sale;
thereafter, the committee submitted the deed of sale together with the
supporting documents to petitioner Data for signing; on the basis of the
supporting certified documents which appeared regular and complete on their
face, petitioner Data, as head of the office and the signing authority at that
level, merely signed but did not approve the deed of sale (Exhibit G) as the
approval thereof was the prerogative of the Secretary of Public Works; he
thereafter transmitted the signed deed of sale with its supporting documents to
Director <span class="SpellE">Anolin</span> of the Bureau of Public Works who in
turn recommended approval thereof by the Secretary of Public Works; the deed of
sale was approved by the Asst. Secretary of Public Works after a review and
re-examination thereof at that level; after the approval of the deed of sale by
the higher authorities the covering voucher for payment thereof was prepared
which petitioner Data signed; petitioner Data did not know Gutierrez and had
never met her during the processing and payment of her claims (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, February 26, 1987, pp. 10-14, 16-24, 31-32)." (At
pp. 267-268, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the alleged conspiracy, the Solicitor General argues:</p>

<blockquote>"It is respectfully submitted that the prosecution likewise
has not shown any positive and convincing evidence of conspiracy between the
petitioners and their co-accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
was no direct finding of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Court's inference on the alleged existence of conspiracy
merely upon the purported ‘pre-assigned roles (of the accused) in the
commission of the (alleged) illegal acts in question’ is not supported by any
evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the
seventy?eight (78) page Decision was there any specific allusion to some
or even one instance which would link either petitioner Arias or Data to their
co-accused in the planning, preparation and/or perpetration, if any, of the
purported fraud and falsifications alleged in the Information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That petitioners</span>
Data and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Arias </span>happened to be
officials of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> District Engineering Office
who signed the deed of sale and passed on pre-audit the general voucher
covering the subject sale, respectively, does not raise any presumption or
inference that they were part of the alleged plan to defraud the Government, as
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">indeed </span>there was none.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be remembered that, as <span class="SpellE">aboveshown</span>, there was no undue injury caused to the
Government as the negotiated purchase of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span>
property was made at the fair and reasonable price of P80.00 per square meter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That there were erasures and superimpositions of the words and
figures of the purchase price in the deed of sale from P1,546,240.00 to
P1,520,320.00 does not prove conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It may be noted that there was a reduction in the affected area from the
estimated 19,328 square meters to 19,004 square meters as approved by the Land
Registration Commission, which resulted in the corresponding reduction in the
purchase price from P1<span class="GramE">,546,240.00</span> to
P1,520,320.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The erasures in the deed
of sale were simple corrections that even benefited the Government.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, contrary to the respondent Court's suspicion, there was
nothing irregular in the use of the unapproved survey plan/technical
description in the deed of sale because the approval of the survey
plan/technical description was not a prerequisite to the approval of the deed
of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that
before any payment is made by the Government under the deed of sale the title
of the seller must have already been cancelled and another one issued to the Government
incorporating therein the technical description as approved by the Land
Registration Commission, as what obtained in the instant case." (At pp.
273-275, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the counsel for the People.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no adequate evidence to establish
the guilt of the petitioners, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> C. Arias and <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> D. Data, beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inadequate evidence on record is not

<p class="BODY">Both Arias and Data appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arias anchors his petition for review of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan's</span>
decision (G.R. No. 81563) on his contention that the court's findings that he
conspired with his co-accused and that he was grossly negligent are based on misapprehension
of facts, speculation, surmise, and conjecture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Data's main defense is that the acquisition of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property was the work of the committee of <span class="SpellE">Precillo</span> Fernando in which he did not take an active part,
and that the price which the Government paid for it was reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it suffered no injury in the
transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his consolidated brief or comment for the State, the Solicitor
General recommends the acquittal of the petitioners because the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property was allegedly not grossly overpriced.</p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petitions in these cases, we find no
error in the decision under review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> did not err in finding that the petitioners
conspired with their co-accused to cause injury to the Government and to unduly
favor the lot owner, <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence of the acts
charged, but may and generally must be proven by a number of indefinite acts,
conditions and circumstances (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Maralit</span>,
G.R. No. 71143, Sept. 19, 1988; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Roca</span>, G.R.
No. 77779, June 27, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case presents a conspiracy of silence and inaction where
chiefs of office who should have been vigilant to protect the interest of the
Government in the purchase of <span class="SpellE">Agleham's</span> two-hectare <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>, accepted as gospel truth the certifications of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">their </span>subordinates, and approved
without question the million-peso purchase which, by the standards prevailing
in 1976-78, should have pricked their curiosity and prompted them to make
inquiries and to verify the authenticity of the documents presented to them for
approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners kept silent
when they should have asked questions; they looked the other way when they
should have probed deep into the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since it was too much of a coincidence that both petitioners were
negligent at the same time over the same transaction, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
was justified in concluding that they connived and conspired to act in that
manner to approve the illegal transaction which would favor the seller of the
land and defraud the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot accept Arias' excuse that because the deed of sale had
been signed and the property transferred to the Government which received a
title in its name, there was nothing else for him to do but approve the voucher
for payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The primary function of an
auditor is to prevent irregular, unnecessary, excessive or extravagant
expenditures of government funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">auditorial</span> function of an auditor,
as a representative of the Commission on Audit, comprises three aspects:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) examination; (2) audit; and (3)
settlement of the accounts, funds, financial transactions and resources of the
agencies under their respective audit jurisdiction (Sec. 43, Government
Auditing Code of the Phil.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Examination, as applied to auditing, means "to probe records, or
inspect securities or other documents; review procedures, and question persons,
all for the purpose of arriving at an opinion of accuracy, propriety,
sufficiency, and the like." <span class="GramE">(State Audit Code of the
Philippines, Annotated by <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>, 1982 Ed., p. 57.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Arias admitted that he did not check or verify the papers
supporting the general voucher that was submitted to him for payment of P1<span class="GramE">,520,320</span> to <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> or his
attorney-in-fact, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> Gutierrez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arias did not question any person for the purpose
of determining the accuracy and integrity of the documents submitted to him and
the reasonableness of the price that the Government was paying for the less
than two-hectare <span class="SpellE">riceland</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We reject <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">his </span>casuistic explanation that since his subordinates had passed
upon the <span class="GramE">transaction,</span> he could assume that it was
lawful and regular for, if he would be a mere rubber stamp for his
subordinates, his position as auditor would be useless and unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We make the same observation concerning District Engineer <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> Data who claims innocence because he allegedly
did not take any direct and active participation in the acquisition of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property, throwing the blame on the committee which
he created, composed of Fernando, Asuncion, Mendoza, Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Hucom</span>
and Jose that negotiated with the property owners for the purchase of
properties on the path of the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> Floodway
Project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He in effect would hide under
the skirt of the committee which he himself selected and to which he delegated
the task that was assigned to his office - to identify the lots that would be
traversed by the floodway project, gather and verify documents, make surveys,
negotiate with the owners for the price, prepare the deeds of sale, and process
claims for payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By appointing the
committee, he did not cease to be responsible for the implementation of the
project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the principle of command
responsibility, he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>responsible
for the manner in which the committee performed its tasks for it was he who in
fact signed the deed of sale prepared by the committee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By signing the deed of sale and
certifications prepared for his signature by his committee, he in effect, made
their acts his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is, therefore,
equally guilty with those members of the committee (Fernando, Cruz and Jose)
who accepted the fake tax declarations and made false certifications regarding
the use and value of the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General has pointed out that Data signed, but did
not approve, the deed of sale of <span class="SpellE">Agleham's</span> property
because the approval thereof was the prerogative of the Secretary of Public
Works.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be overlooked,
however, that Data's signature on the deed of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">sale was equivalent </span>to an attestation that the transaction was
fair, honest and legal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was he who
was charged with the task of implementing the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span>
Floodway Project within his engineering district.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the Solicitor General's argument that the <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span> <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> was not
overpriced because the price of P80 per square meter fixed in the deed of sale
was reasonable, hence, the petitioners are not guilty of having caused undue
injury and prejudice to the Government, nor of having given unwarranted
benefits to the property owner and/or his attorney-in-fact, Gutierrez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further argues that the valuation in the
owner's genuine tax declaration may not be used as a standard in determining
the fair market value of the property because PD Nos. 76 and 464 (making it
mandatory in expropriation cases to fix the price at the value of the property
as declared by the owner, or as determined by the assessor, whichever is
lower), were declared null and void by this Court in the case of <u>Export
Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) vs. <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span></u>, 149
SCRA 305, and other related cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">That argument is not well taken because PD Nos. 76 and 464
(before they were nullified) applied to the expropriation of property for
public use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The acquisition of <span class="SpellE">Agleham's</span> <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> was not done
by expropriation but through a negotiated sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the course of the negotiations, there was absolutely <u>no allegation
nor proof</u> that the price of P80 per square meter was its fair market value
in 1978, i.e., eleven (11) years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What the accused did was to prove the value of the land through fake tax
declarations (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. B, F, K), false certifications (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">J, D and E) and a forged sworn
statement on the current and fair market value of the real property (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> Z) <span class="GramE">submitted</span> by the
accused in support of the deed of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because fraudulent documents were used, it may not be said that the
State agreed to pay the price on the basis of its fairness, for the Government
was in fact deceived concerning the reasonable value of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Ocol</span> testified <u>in 1983</u> that
P80 was a reasonable valuation for the <span class="SpellE">Agleham's</span> land,
he did not clarify that that was also its reasonable value in 1975, before real
estate values in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> soared as a result of the
implementation of the <span class="SpellE">Mangahan</span> Floodway Project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Ocol's</span>
testimony was insufficient to rebut the valuation in <span class="SpellE">Agleham's</span>
genuine 1978 Tax Declaration No. 47895 that the fair valuation of the <span class="SpellE">riceland</span> then was only P5 per square meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Tax Declaration is a guide or indicator of
the reasonable value of the property (EPZA vs. <span class="SpellE">Dulay</span>,
<u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' partiality for <span class="SpellE">Agleham</span>/Gutierrez
may be inferred from their having deliberately closed their eyes to the defects
and irregularities of the transaction in his favor and their seeming neglect,
if not deliberate omission, to check, the authenticity of the documents
presented to them for approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
partiality is a mental state or predilection, in the absence of direct
evidence, it may be proved by the attendant circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, I vote to
affirm <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in SB <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case
