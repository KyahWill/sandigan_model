				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span>
in a verified complaint dated <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="8">August
 24, 1978</st1:date> charged lawyer Federico S. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
with malicious prosecution and having thus violated his attorney's oath.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> in his answer denied the
charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was referred to the Solicitor
General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
assisted his client, Jose <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span>, Jr., in filing on <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1976</st1:date> a complaint for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> against <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span> in the
municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
(Criminal Case No. 7343).</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged that <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span>
misappropriated the proceeds of the sale of 265 bags of cement which <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span> had entrusted to <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span>
for sale on commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting the corresponding preliminary examination, the
municipal court issued a warrant for the arrest of <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span>,
fixing the bail at two thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span> was arrested on <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1976</st1:date> in his office at the <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span> Mining and Industrial Corporation in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila where he was
employed as assistant manager of the purchasing-traffic department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and
detained in jail for two days before he was released on bail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case was elevated to the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Guagua</span> Branch II where it is still being tried (Criminal
Case No. 1214).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether respondent <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
committed a gross misconduct in assisting his client in filing an <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge which, according to <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span>,
was fabricated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that respondent lawyer acted in good faith in helping <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span> file the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge and
that he regularly performed his professional duty to <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That cannot be a ground for disbarment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sapaden's</span> claim that he was framed up
by the respondent was not proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
municipal court found that there was a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case against <span class="SpellE">Sapaden</span> or that there was a reasonable ground to believe
that he committed <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, up to this time, he has not been
exonerated of the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> charge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the complaint for disbarment is dismissed.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
