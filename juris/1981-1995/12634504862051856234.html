<p class="BODY">The appellant argues that Cabacungan is not in Padada, but is
situated in Barrio Bulacan, Malalag, Davao; that it is not true that Fermin
Cañizares was arrested on May 25, 1966, but was detained after he voluntarily
went to the municipal building of Padada, to­gether with Vice-Mayor Santos
Matubang of Malalag and then Councilor Saturnino Rosario to intercede in behalf
of his brother Mariano who had been arrested and detained in connection with
the present case; that no witness by the name of Gabino Oyanguren had been
presented by the prosecution or the defense; and that the accused Fermin
Cañizares and his wife, although living at Cabacungan, did not stay in the

Rosario.</p>

defense that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed and that it
was physically impossible for them to be at the scene of the crime at the time
it was committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants claim
that the Municipal Mayor of Padada, <st1:city><st1:place>Davao</st1:place></st1:city>

their prosecution notwithstand­ing their innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant testified that from 1963 to 1966, he was adminis­tering

situated in Paligue, Bulacan, Padada, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In March, 1966, he invited his brothers

Padada, <st1:city><st1:place>Davao</st1:place></st1:city>, and brought to the

asked Primitiva if he (Fermin) was one of the robbers, and Primitiva answered
that he was not because the robber was already old and had a beard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the vice-mayor wanted to take him

Santos Matubang and Saturnino Rosario who both declared that they were present
when the chief of police of Padada asked Primitiva Delima whether or not Fermin
Cañizares was one of the robbers and Primitiva Delima answered that Fermin was
not the robber because the robber had a beard and is old.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Matubang and Rosario are, however, belied by
acting chief of police Caminero who testified in court that in the afternoon of
<st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1966</st1:date>, Fermin
Cañizares, Antonio Cañizares and Mariano Cañizares were pin-pointed <span style="">in </span>the office of the chief of police

Between the biased testimony of defense witnesses Matubang and Rosario and the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant's claim
that Mayor Ordaneza of Padada, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> instigated the filing of this case against

into implicating the appellant, or that Primitiva Delima and Eufrosina Delima
had any motive to testify falsely against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the appellant, which is affirmed by Saturnino
Rosario and Andres Tapic, that he was sleeping with his wife in the house of
Saturnino Rosario on the night in question is belied by the positive
identification of the appellant by Primitiva Delima and Eufrosina Delima that
he was one of the robbers and the person who raped Primitiva Delima.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, Andres Tapic merely testified that he saw the appellant
in the house of Saturnino Rosario at 9:00 o'clock in the evening of May 23,
1966, where he stayed for about two hours, and again at 5:30 o'clock in the

although the appellant declared that he woke up at about 7:00 o'clock in the
morning of <span style="">May </span>24, 1966, so that he
could not have known what the appellant did between those hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the crime was committed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1966" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1966</st1:date>, his testimony is of
little importance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no
positive showing that Cabacungan, Malalag, <st1:city><st1:place>Davao</st1:place></st1:city>,
where the house of Saturnino Rosario is situated, is very distant and
inaccessible from Paligue, Bulacan, Padada, <st1:city><st1:place>Davao</st1:place></st1:city>,
