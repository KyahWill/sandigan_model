				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">After he and his wife were individually hog-tied and their house
ransacked, JUANITO GARAY, <span style="">a </span>lawyer,
was found dead with three (3) gunshot wounds.  For his death and the loss of their things on the occasion thereof,
AURELIO BANDULA, PANTALEON SEDIGO, TEOFILO DIONANAO and VICTORIANO EJAN were
haled to court for robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 5 May 1989, after hearing twelve (12) prosecution and nine (9)
defense witnesses, the trial court rendered judgment finding accused Aurelio
Bandula guilty of the crime charged.  However, his three (3) co-accused were acquitted "for insufficiency
of evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the court <i><span style="">a
quo,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>on 27 January 1986, at around ten
o'clock in the evening, six (6) armed men barged into the compound of Polo
Coconut Plantation in Tanjay, Negros Oriental.  The armed men were identified by Security Guard Antonio Salva of the
plantation as Aurelio Bandula, Teofilo Dionanao, Victoriano Ejan and Pantaleon
Sedigo while the two others who wore masks were simply referred to as "Boy
Tall" and "Boy Short." At gunpoint, the two (2) masked men held
Salva who was manning his post, disarmed him of his shotgun and tied his hands
behind his back.  They then went up the
house of Leoncio Pastrano, Chief of Security and General Foreman of the
plantation, hog-tied him, and divested him of his driver's license, goggles, <span style="">wristwatch and .38 cal. snubnose
revolver.  </span>From there, the six
(6) armed men with Salva and Pastrano in tow proceeded to the house of Atty.
Juanito Garay, Manager of the Polo Coconut Plantation.  Accused Dionanao, Ejan and Sedigo stayed
downstairs while accused Bandula and the two masked men with Salva and Pastrano
went up the house of Atty. Garay.  After
forcing their way into the house, the masked men and Bandula ransacked the
place and took with them money and other valuables.  Thereafter, the hooded men who were bringing with them Atty.
Garay locked Pastrano inside his house together with Salva.  A few minutes later, Pastrano and Salva
heard gunshots coming from the direction of the gate of the compound.  After succeeding in untying themselves,
Pastrano and Salva went to report the matter to the police.  On their way, they found outside the gate
the lifeless body of Atty. Garay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at its conclusions, the trial court considered the
alleged confession of accused Bandula that after the incident he gave his .38 cal.
revolver for safekeeping to Jovito Marimat, Jr., from whom three handguns were
recovered by the police, i.e., <span style="">a </span>.38
cal. revolver with four (4) live ammunitions and one (1) empty shell, a .22
cal. "paltik" revolver, and a revolver with M16 bullets.  It likewise took into account the supposed
admission of accused Victoriano Ejan that he kept a 12-gauge Winchester
shotgun, a tape recorder, a bayonet and a pair of binoculars in the house of
his relative Emilio Rendora who was found to have the goods in his
possession.  The court also noted that a
sum of money suspected to be part of the loot was recovered from accused
Pantaleon Sedigo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admitted also in evidence were the alleged extrajudicial
confessions of accused Bandula and Dionanao that they were merely forced to
participate in the commission of the crime by "Boy Tall" and
"Boy Short." "These extrajudicial confessions made by accused
Teofilo Dionanao and Aurelio Bandula extracted during custodial
investigation," the trial court ruled, "have all the qualities and
have complied with all the requirements of an admissible confession, it
appearing from the confession itself that accused were informed of their rights
under the law regarding custodial investigation and were duly represented by
counsel (Atty. Ruben Zerna)."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the trial court disregarded the following defenses of the
four (4) accused:</p>

<p class="NUM">(a) Teofilo Dionanao - that he was arrested without a warrant and
brought to the Tanjay Police Station on 28 January 1986 for no apparent reason;
that there he was made to sit on a bench for about an hour when Cpl. Kagawasan
Borromeo, Pat. Tomas Borromeo and Pat. El Moso arrived and took turns in
mauling him until he spat blood, after which, he was locked up <span style="">in </span>the municipal jail; that his
repeated requests to see a doctor were ignored; that the following morning, he
was taken out of his cell and again mauled, after which, he was forced to sign
a piece of paper without a counsel and the contents of which he did not know;
that, prior to his detention, he did not know his three (3) co-accused as he
met them for the first time only when they were detained together in the
Municipal Jail of Tanjay.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">(b) Aurelio Bandula - that in the evening of 27 January 1986 he
was in the house of Jovito Marimat, Sr., a quack doctor; that he was bedridden
as he was undergoing treatment for an inflamed stomach which, at that time, was
fully covered with herbs; that, the following morning, at around six o'clock,
he was awakened and dragged by Cpl. Borromeo and Pat. Moso from his sickbed into
a waiting motorcycle and brought to the Municipal Hall where he was
interrogated by Pat. Melvin Baldejera; that, later that afternoon, he was
brought to a room where four (4) persons, including Antonio Salva, took turns
in beating him up until he became unconscious; that that evening, he was made
to sign a blank paper purportedly for his release; that he was then put behind
bars; that because of the mauling, he felt extreme pain on his left rib; that
he saw accused Dionanao for the first time only on 28 January 1986 in the
Municipal Hall, and his two (2) other co-accused Sedigo and Ejan only the
following day when they were locked up together with him in his cell; that his
relatives were not allowed to see him; and, that he did not know nor ever met
Atty. Ruben Zerna.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">(c) Victoriano Ejan - that he first met his three (3) co-accused
only on 29 January 1986 when he was confined in the Municipal Hall; that after
taking supper on 27 January 1986, he slept with his wife and four (4) children;
that he was not aware of the incident that transpired that night until he was
arrested at gunpoint by Pat. Moso, Pat.Gaste and Pat. Esparicia at around five
o'clock the following afternoon; that he was brought to the Municipal Hall and
there mauled until he lost consciousness; that his relatives were barred from
seeing him; that during his four-month detention in Tanjay, he was never
investigated; that he has no relative by the name of Emilio Rendora.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">(d) Pantaleon Sedigo - that on 29 January 1986, at around
six-thirty in the morning, Pat. Esparicia and Cpl. Borromeo, with their guns
drawn, just barged into his house, searched his belongings and arrested him
without a warrant; that when he refused to go with them, he was hit on the
chest and eye; that he had never met any of his co-accused prior to his
detention, neither did he know the deceased Atty. Garay; and, that he did not
know anything about the charges against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 June 1986, the four (4) accused were transferred from the
Municipal Jail of Tanjay to the Negros Oriental Provincial Rehabilitation
Center in Dumaguete City.  It was there
where accused Bandula asked to see a doctor; that, as a result of his request,
he was brought to the provincial hospital where he was examined<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and diagnosed to have an "[o]ld healed fracture with callous formation at
the 6th and 7th rib along the mid-auxiliary line, left;"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that when prosecution witness Pat. Baldejera was asked on 15 September 1987 in
open court if he saw any contusions or bruises on any of the four (4) accused
after their arrest, he admitted that he noticed accused Sedigo with a
"black eye."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the respective alibis of all four (4) accused were
disregarded considering their positive identification by Salva as the ones who
raided Polo Coconut Plantation, the trial court nevertheless acquitted
Dionanao, Ejan and Sedigo on the ground that while "these three accused
were present at the scene of the crime x x x from the inception of the crime to
its final termination, they were merely bystanders and did not participate in
one way or another in the commission thereof <span style="">x x x x  </span>The mere
knowledge, acquiescence or approval of the act without cooperation or agreement
to cooperate is not enough to constitute one a party to a conspiracy.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the instant appeal by the lone convict.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Bandula argues that the extrajudicial confessions he
and accused Dionanao executed suffer from constitutional infirmities, hence,
inadmissible in evidence considering that they were extracted under duress and
intimidation, and were merely countersigned later by the municipal attorney
who, by the nature of his position, was not entirely an independent counsel nor
counsel of their choice.  Consequently,
without the extrajudicial confessions, the prosecution is left without
sufficient evidence to convict him of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses themselves disclosed that on 28 January
1986 accused Dionanao was "picked-up for investigation" and
interrogated by Cpl. Ephraim Valles inside the Police Station in Tanjay where
he implicated accused Sedigo.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
following day, on 29 January 1986, he was brought to the Office of the
Municipal Attorney of Tanjay, Atty. Ruben Zerna, where he supposedly executed
his extrajudicial confession in the presence of the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
On 4 February 1986, upon the suggestion of another investigator, Cpl. Valles
took the Supplementary Sworn Statement of Dionanao, again in the presence of
Atty. Zerna.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In his Sworn Statement, Dionanao supposedly admitted that he was with Bandula
when the latter, together with "Boy Short" and "Boy Tall,"
shot Atty. Garay.  He added that he was
going to be killed if he did not join the group.  He also said that Sedigo and Ejan were with them that evening.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, in his Supplementary Sworn Statement, he implicated three (3) more persons
but they were not thereafter included in the Information.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution likewise asseverated that accused Bandula was
arrested on 28 January 1986, at around six o'clock <span style="">in </span>the morning, brought to the Tanjay Police Station and there
interrogated.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
He was investigated by Cpl. Borromeo, Cpl. Esparicia, Cpl. Ebarso, Pat. Moso
and Pat. Baldejera.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> In
that investigation, Bandula allegedly admitted that he together with two (2)
others shot Atty. Garay with a .38 cal. revolver.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
At that time, there was no counsel present "because that (investigation)
was not yet in writing."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> Two
weeks after his arrest, Bandula allegedly gave a sworn statement in the
presence of Atty. Zerna admitting his participation in the killing of Atty.
Garay.  In that statement, Bandula
narrated that after "Boy Short" and "Boy Tall" shot Atty.
Garay, he (Bandula) was ordered likewise to shoot the latter which he did.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From the records, it can be gleaned that when accused-appellant
Bandula and accused Dionanao were investigated immediately after their arrest,
they had no counsel present.  If at all,
counsel came in only a day after the custodial investigation with respect to
accused Dionanao, and two weeks later with respect to appellant Bandula.  And, counsel who supposedly assisted both
accused was Atty. Ruben Zerna, the Municipal Attorney of Tanjay.  On top of this, there are telltale signs
that violence was used against the accused.  Certainly, these are blatant violations of the Constitution which
mandates in Sec. 12, Art. III, that -</p>

<blockquote>(1)  Any person under investigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed of his right to
remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of his
own choice.  If the person cannot afford
the services of counsel, he must be provided with one.  These rights cannot be waived except in
writing and in the presence of counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  No torture, force, violence, threat,
intimidation or any other means which vitiate the free will shall be used
against him.  Secret detention places,
solitary, <i>incommunicado, </i>or other similar forms of detention are
prohibited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)  Any confession or admission obtained in
violation of this or Section 17 hereof shall be inadmissible in evidence
against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)  The law shall provide for penal and civil
sanctions for violations of this section as well as compensation to and
rehabilitation of victims of torture or similar practices, and their families.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the twin cases of <b>Morales, Jr., v. Enrile</b><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and <b>Moncupa, Jr. v. Enrile,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> and
the subsequent case of <b>People v. Galit,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> all
promulgated even before the effectivity of the 1987 Constitution, we laid down
the procedure for peace officers to follow when making an arrest and conducting
a custodial investigation -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x </span>At the time a person
is arrested, it shall be the duty of the arresting officer to inform him of the
reason for the arrest and he must be shown the warrant of arrest, if any.  He shall be informed of his constitutional
rights to remain silent and to counsel, and that any statement he might make
could be used against him.  The person
arrested shall have the right to communicate with his lawyer, a relative, or
anyone he chooses by the most expedient means - by telephone if possible - or
by letter or messenger.  It shall be the
responsibility of the arresting officer to see to it that this is
accomplished.  No custodial
investigation shall be conducted unless it be in the presence of counsel
engaged by the person arrested, by any person on his behalf, or appointed by
the court upon petition either of the detainee himself or by anyone on his
behalf.  The right to counsel may be
waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made with the assistance of
counsel.  Any statement obtained in
violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether exculpatory or
inculpatory, in whole or in part, shall be inadmissible in evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We further said in <b>Gamboa v. Judge Cruz</b><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
that "[t]he right to counsel attaches upon the start of an investigation,
i.e., when the investigating officer starts to ask questions to elicit
information and/or confessions or admissions from respondent/accused.  At such point or stage, the person being
interrogated must be assisted by counsel to avoid the pernicious practice of
extorting false or coerced admissions or confessions from the lips of the
person undergoing interrogation for the commission of the offense." Hence,
if there is no counsel at the start of the custodial investigation, any
statement elicited from the accused is inadmissible in evidence against him.  Custodial investigation is the stage where
the police investigation is no longer <span style="">a
</span>general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has began to focus on a
particular suspect who had been taken into custody by the police who carry out
a process of interrogation that lends itself to elicit incriminating
statements.  It is when questions are
initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into
custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the instant case is analogous to the more recent case of <b><span style="">People v. De Jesus</span></b><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where we said that admissions
obtained during custodial interrogations without the benefit of counsel
although later reduced to writing and signed in the presence of counsel are
still flawed under the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution also requires that counsel be <b>independent.  </b>Obviously, he cannot be a special
counsel, public or private prosecutor, counsel of the police, or a municipal
attorney whose interest is admittedly adverse to the accused.  Granting that Atty. Zerna assisted accused
Dionanao and Bandula when they executed their respective extrajudicial
confessions, still their confessions are inadmissible in evidence considering
that Atty. Zerna does not qualify as an independent counsel.  As a legal officer of the municipality, he
provides legal assistance and support to the mayor and the municipality in
carrying out the delivery of basic services to the people, including the
maintenance of peace and order.  It is
thus seriously doubted whether he can effectively undertake the defense of the
accused without running into conflict of interests.  He is no better than a fiscal or prosecutor who cannot represent
the accused during custodial investigations.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is most upsetting however is the allegation of the four (4)
accused that they were mauled into owning the crime.  Based on the records, we are strongly drawn to the belief that
violence indeed attended the extraction of statements from the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">For, why did the investigators not inform the accused of their
right to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel,
preferably of their own choice, even before attempting to elicit statements
that would incriminate them?  Why did
the investigators not advise the accused that if they could not afford the
services of counsel they could be provided with counsel free of charge before
conducting any investigation?  Why did
the investigators continuously disregard the repeated requests of the accused
for medical assistance? How did accused Sedigo get his "black eye"
which even Pat. Baldejera admitted? How and why did accused-appellant Bandula
suffer a fractured rib?</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot close our eyes to these unanswered questions.  This Court is greatly disturbed with the way
the accused were treated or maltreated.  In fine, we cannot accept the extrajudicial confessions of the accused
and use the same against them or any of them.  Where there is doubt as to their voluntariness, the same must be
rejected <i><span style="">in </span>toto.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the prosecution is left with nothing but the
alleged positive identification of appellant Bandula by witness Salva.  But this by itself does not measure up to
the required standard of moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot give credence to the lone identification by witness
Salva of all four (4) accused who were supposedly bold enough to bare their
faces.  For, Maria Paz Garay, widow of
the victim, recounted that except for Pastrano and Salva whose hands were tied
behind their backs, she could not recognize any of the men as all their faces
were fully covered, although according to Salva only two (2) were hooded.  She could only see their eyes.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, even Pastrano who witnessed the crime together with Salva was not able to
recognize any of the armed men as they were hooded.  In fact, even if there was light, he said he would not be able to
recognize the malefactors.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Contraposed with the testimonies of Garay and Pastrano, the alleged positive
identification by Salva crumbles.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the <span style="">failure of the
prosecution to prove the guilt of accused-appellant </span>Bandula beyond
reasonable doubt, acquittal should follow as a matter of course.  We have oftentimes said that while the alibi
of the accused is easily fabricated, this claim assumes importance when faced
with the inconsistencies and the rather shaky nature of the prosecution
evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The prosecution must rely not on the weakness of the defense evidence but
rather on its own proof which must be strong enough to convince this Court that
the prisoner in the dock deserves to be punished.  In this, the state has utterly failed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is unfortunate that the investigators who are sworn to
do justice to all appear to have toyed with the fundamental rights of the
accused.  Men in uniform do not have
blanket authority to arrest anybody they take fancy on, rough him up and put
words into his mouth.  There is a living
Constitution which safeguards the rights of an accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
a penal law which punishes maltreatment of prisoners<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
and a statute which penalizes the failure to inform and accord the accused his
constitutional rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, on reasonable doubt, the conviction of
