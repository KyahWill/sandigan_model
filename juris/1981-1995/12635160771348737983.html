(hereafter <i>SIHI</i>) and public respondent sheriff.<br><br>The factual antecedents which led to the filing of the complaint are briefly summarized in the assailed decision of the Court of Appeals as follows:<br><br>Sometime in December, 1982, spouses Carlos A. Gobonseng, Jr. and Theresita Mimie P. Gobonseng filed with the State Investment House, Inc. at its Branch Office in Cebu City an application for a P2-million loan.&nbsp; Whereupon, the parties executed a Credit Agreement [Exhibit "A"] whereby SIHI granted the Gobonsengs a credit line or accommodation in the sum of P2-million.&nbsp; Accordingly, the Gobonsengs constituted a Real Estate Mortgage over their three (3) parcels of land in Dumaguete City covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.<i> </i>12979, 13535 and 13607 as collaterals.&nbsp; The mortgage contract was annotated at the back of said titles [Exhibits "VV-2", "WW-2", and "KK-2"].<br><br>On January 19, 1983, the parties agreed to reduce the amount of the loan from P2-million to P900,000.00 [Exhibits "5", "5-A"].&nbsp; An Amended Real Estate Mortgage [Exhibit "6"] was executed by the parties to reflect the said amount.<br><br>Later, the Gobonsengs again applied for an additional loan of P800,000.00.&nbsp; SIHI approved the application under the same terms and conditions as the first loan but with an additional collateral [Exhibit "9"].<br><br>Pursuant to their Credit Agreement [Exhibit "7"], SIHI granted the Gobonsengs credit lines for such amounts which they desire to avail of.&nbsp; The availments of such amounts, renewable from time to time, have an average term of sixty (60) days each.<br><br>On January 21, 1983, the Gobonsengs availed of the full amount of P900,000.00 which they renewed from time to time.&nbsp; With respect to the loan of P800,000.00, the Gobonsengs obtained various amounts in installments.&nbsp; The term of each loan granted has an average of 60 days.&nbsp; For each renewal, a corresponding promissory note was executed by the Gobonsengs.&nbsp; Their last availment of P900,000.00 was on March 15, 1984 payable on May 2, 1984.&nbsp; As to the loan of P800,000.00, their last availment thereof was on March 2, 1984 payable also on May 2, 1984.&nbsp; These availments are correspondingly covered by two promissory notes signed by the Gobonsengs [Exhibits "12" and "13"].<br><br>On January 21, 1983, SIHI and the Gobonsengs executed a Consultancy Contract [Exhibit "8"] whereby the Gobonsengs agreed to pay SIHI for its consultancy services and professional advice.<br><br>Claiming that the Gobonsengs failed to pay the two loans on their due date on May 2, 1984 and that despite demands, failed to remit the payment due, SIHI instituted an extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings with defendant Provincial Sheriff Benjamin V. Diputado, who scheduled the auction sale of the spouses' properties on July 18, 1984 at 9:00 A.M.<br><br>On June 21, 1984, before the scheduled date of the foreclosure sale, the Gobonsengs filed with the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> a complaint for annulment/reformation of documents and damages with prayer for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against SIHI and Benjamin V. Diputado, in his capacity as Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court and Sheriff Negros Oriental.&nbsp; As stated above, the complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 8428.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On 27 June 1984, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order directing the provincial sheriff of Negros Oriental to cease and desist, until further orders from the court, from conducting extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings of the real estate mortgages executed by the Gobonsengs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> It also set for hearing on 11 July 1984 the application for a writ of preliminary injunction<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> which SIHI vigorously opposed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>In its Answer filed on 30 July 1984,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> SIHI denied the material allegations in the complaint and alleged the following: (1) the credit agreement for P2 million which the Gobonsengs signed on 27 December 1982 was amended and correspondingly adjusted to P900,000.00 on 19 January 1983; (2) on 21 January 1983, the Gobonsengs executed a Consultancy Contract; (3) they later availed of their P900,000.00 credit line and were granted by SIHI a loan in the said amount which was renewed from time to time for a term averaging sixty days; (4) on 23 August 1983, the Gobonsengs, upon an additional collateral, applied for and were granted an additional loan of P800,000.00 which was renewed from time to time on an average term of sixty days, the last of which prior to the filing of the complaint, was on 2 March 1984 to mature sixty-one days thereafter, or on 2 May 1984; (5) the loan of P900,000.00 was last renewed on 15 March 1984 prior to the filing of the case and which was to mature forty-eight days thereafter, or on 2 May 1984; (6) when both the P800,000.00 and P900,000.00 loans matured on 2 May 1984, the Gobonsengs failed to remit correct payments thus placing their loans on past-due status; and (7) since demands for payment were to no avail, SIHI initiated the extrajudicial foreclosure of the real estate mortgage contracts.<br><br>After due hearing, the trial court denied on 10 July 1985 the application for a writ of preliminary injunction for lack of "clear, convincing and unquestioned evidence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> After their motion for its reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> was denied in an order dated 13 September 1985,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the Gobonsengs sought relief therefrom in the then Intermediate Appellate Court through a special civil action for <i>certiorari </i>which was docketed as AC-G.R.

No. 72131.&nbsp; Upon its filing, this Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the provincial sheriff of Negros Oriental from proceeding with the publication of the notice of the auction sale of the mortgaged lots set on 28 September 1985, 5 October 1935, 12 October 1985, and 16 October 1985.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Eventually, in a resolution dated 22 October 1986, this Court denied the petition for lack of merit considering that "the basic controversy between the parties involves factual issues, particularly, the maturity dates of the promissory notes evidencing the indebtedness, petitioners claiming six (6) years, while the SIHI 60 to 48 days."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The Gobonsengs seasonably filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied with finality in the resolution of 18 February 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> With leave of court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> they filed a second motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> based on alleged newly discovered evidence consisting of photocopies of advice slips sent by SIHI to the Gobonsengs and an inter-office memorandum dated 13 December 1992 of one Shirley T.

This Court granted the motion in the resolution of 20 May 1987,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals, remanded the case to the trial court for trial on the merits of the main case, and issued a temporary restraining order enjoining SIHI from foreclosing the real estate mortgage executed by the Gobonsengs until after the merits of the main case shall have been resolved.&nbsp; In the said resolution, this Court stated, <i>inter alia:</i><br><br>Considering the conflicting factual allegations of the parties; the admitted fact that petitioners were made to sign blank promissory notes, real estate mortgages, etc., by SIHI (Rejoinder to Reply, p. 298, Rollo;

Carlos Gobonseng, Jr. further testified that when he went to SIHI's office in Manila in March 1987 he was shown his loan record and on that occasion saw the credit availment and the inter-office memorandum (Exhibit "GGG").<br><br>Joaquin Castro, former Credit Supervisor and later Assistant Manager of SIHI's Cebu Branch who was the first appraiser assigned by SIHI to appraise the properties offered as security by the Gobonsengs, confirmed the existence of the inter-office memorandum (Exhibits "GGG" and "EEEE") and described the loan of the Gobonsengs as "long term," four a term of six years.<br><br>The trial court disregarded the testimony of Augusto Lopez?Dee, SIHI's Vice-President, that he did not send any telex to the Cebu Branch because Shirley Uy failed to categorically deny the inter-office memorandum which Joaquin Castro said he saw at the time it was prepared.&nbsp; It also disregarded the documentary evidence for SIHI showing that the original copies (Exhibits "26," "27," "28," "29," and "30") of the credit advice slips offered in evidence by the Gobonsengs have unfilled blanks for the lines PERIOD-PRINCIPAL and PERIOD-INTEREST while the box for Description in each has the entry Purchase of Commercial Papers for (days indicated) because the photocopies presented by the Gobonsengs appear to be that of the CLIENT'S COPY of a set of credit advices and, although Dee testified that SIHI does not "normally" send photocopies thereof, there was no evidence that the normal practice was followed with respect to the Gobonsengs' credit advices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>In concluding that the promissory notes did not reflect the true intention of the parties, the trial court relied heavily on the signing by the Gobonsengs of several documents, including blank promissory notes and authority to apply loan proceeds (Exhibits "II," "II-A" to "II-J") whose blanks were thereafter filled up by SIHI without the participation of the Gobonsengs.&nbsp; The signing by the Gobonsengs of these documents in blank is admitted by SIHI in its Answer and by its witnesses Mariano Borromeo, who executed on 28 April 1983 a receipt (Exhibit "K") acknowledging delivery to him by the Gobonsengs of six sets of signed blank promissory notes, and Shirley Uy, who explicitly admitted that the Gobonsengs were made to sign blank SIHI forms such as promissory notes.&nbsp; The trial court also considered the receipt by SIHI of twenty sets of blank promissory notes (Exhibit "L") from the Gobonsengs on 13 November 1983.&nbsp; In the authority to apply loan proceeds, the Gobonsengs "purportedly authorized Defendant SIHI to apply the plaintiffs' 'loan proceeds' under certain Code numbers as 'full/partial payment' of another loan with another Code based on certain maturity dates."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The trial court also observed that the Consultancy Contract dated 21 January 1983 (Exhibit "UU," also Exhibit "8") provides, <i>inter alia, </i>"that (such consultancy) services and professional advises can be communicated with directly or indirectly, verbally or in writing," and such fees are to be fixed "on the basis of manhours spent in rendering the service or on the basis of the volume of consultancy work"; such fees are "payable to the CONSULTANT (SIHI) by the CLIENT upon presentation of the bill to the CLIENT."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> It found, however, that SIHI had not presented satisfactory evidence of consultancy service, for it had not communicated to the Gobonsengs "either directly or indirectly, verbally or in writing" the nature and extent of such consultancy services and had not presented to them a "bill" therefor based on manhours spent in rendering the same. Moreover, it noted that the official receipts issued by SIHI to the Gobonsengs for the so-called consultancy services show that the amounts periodically paid are almost uniform, despite the fact that such fees are supposed to be, based on "manhours spent" or on "volume of consultancy work"; and considering that "it may be assumed that the manhours spent or the volume of consultancy work are bigger at the beginning of any business venture, they [should] considerably decrease to a minimum as time goes on and the businessman, in the process, acquires certain skills and familiarity with appropriate business techniques [such] that he naturally would need only a little more help or even none of it at all, from his consultant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> It then concluded that this uniformity is indicative of payment of interests and not of consultancy fees.<br><br>In allowing the release of excess collaterals, the trial court gave credit to the evidence of the Gobonsengs that the assessed or market value of the four mortgaged lots is "much bigger than their loan indebtedness of P1,700,000.00, which is now even reduced by P7,415.86 as of May 2, 1984 (Exh. "16-A"),"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> and since the offer of the said properties "was predicated on the availability of a credit line of P4,300,000.00 which was approved by Defendant SIHI but was not fully satisfied," it then "stands to reason that some of those properties must be . . . released."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>On appeal to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. CV No. 30380), this decision was "reversed and set aside" in the appellate court's decision of 16 December 1992.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>The findings and conclusion of the Court of Appeals revolve on the "basic issue [of] whether or not the `newly discovered evidence' of the Gobonsengs ... have proved that the term of the two loans is 6 years instead of the terms reflected in the loan documents." Resolving the said issue, it stated:<br><br>We have closely examined appellees' xerox copies of SIHI's advice slips and found the entries "6 years" after the printed words "Period-Principal." We likewise scrutinized the original copies of SIHI's advice slips and observed that the spaces after the printed words "Period-Principal" and "Period-interest" are blank.<br><br>Section 2, Rule 130 of the Revised Rules of Court is pertinent, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 2. Original writing must be produced, exceptions.&nbsp; -- There can be no evidence of a writing the contents of which is the subject of inquiry, other than the original writing itself, except in the following cases.<br><br><table Â ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td valign="TOP" width="10%"><div align="LEFT">(a)</div></td> <td valign="TOP" width="90%"> <div align="JUSTIFY">When the original has been lost, destroyed, or cannot be produced in court; </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">(b)</div></td> <td valign="TOP"> <div align="JUSTIFY">When the original is in the possession of the party against whom the evidence is offered, and the latter fails to produce it after reasonable notice;<br></div></td></tr></tbody></table>x x x."</blockquote>In the case at bar, SIHI produced the original copies of the advice slips before the trial court. Consequently, pursuant to the above Rule, the trial court should not have admitted evidence the xerox copies offered by the appellees.&nbsp; Indeed, We are inclined to believe that the window-envelopes received by the appellees from SIHI contained the pink copies or duplicate originals.&nbsp; For why should SIHI send them mere xerox copies which were not even duly certified? We agree with SIHI that the appellees would not produce these pink copies for the same would be adverse to them.&nbsp; At this juncture, suffice it to state that obviously these pink copies can easily be xerox copied, with prior alteration/s of the entries therein.<br><br>Similarly, the inter-office-memo, also in xerox copy, should not have been admitted in evidence and given weight by the trial court.&nbsp; An inter-office memo is supposed to be kept only in the office concerned.&nbsp; Moreover, Corazon "Azonne" Tan vehemently denied that she has been authorized by SIHI to certify the authenticity of xerox copies of documents and more importantly, that she made the certification in question.<br><br>Verily, the appellees' reliance on their "newly discovered evidence" to prove that the terms of the two loans is 6 years is misplaced.<br><br>A close scrutiny of the Credit Agreement and SIHI's original advice slips shows that every availment of the loans, either wholly or partially, is renewable from time to time and has an average term of 60 days.&nbsp; Appellees' last availment of the P900,000.00 loan was on March 15, 1984 payable on May <i>2, </i>1984.&nbsp; Their last availment of the loan of P800,000.00 was on March 2, 1984, also due on May 2, 1984.&nbsp; These terms are clearly reflected in the two promissory notes signed by the appellees.&nbsp; The words of these promissory notes are clear and leave no doubt upon the true intention of the contracting parties.<br><br>On the matter of excessive consultancy fees, the appellees' posture is that they did not willingly agree to the Consultancy Contract which "they signed in blank."<br><br>By signing the various loan documents, such as Credit Agreement, Real Estate Mortgages, Promissory Notes and Consultancy Contract, the appellees are presumed to be aware of the consequences of their action.&nbsp; Considering that Carlos A. Gobonseng, Jr. is a certified public accountant, a law graduate and a businessman, he is supposed to have acted with due care by meticulously reading the terms and conditions of those contracts before affixing his signature thereon and to have signed those loan agreements with full knowledge of their contents as well as the corresponding obligations and responsibilities.<br><br>It bears stressing that contracts are respected as the law between the contracting parties and that they may not be reformed "simply because a party later finds itself at the shorter end of an unwise bargain."<br><br>In Mata vs. Court of Appeals, et al. G.R. No. 87880, April 7, 1992, citing Tan Sua Sia vs. Yu Baio Sontua, 56 Phil. 711], the Supreme Court pertinently held:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x The rule that one who signs a contract is presumed to know its contents has been applied <span style="font-style: italic;">even to contracts of illiterate persons on the ground that if such persons are unable to read, they are negligent if they fail to have the contract read to them.</span>&nbsp; If a person cannot read the instrument, it is as much his duty to procure some reliable persons to read and explain it to him, before he signs it, as it would be to read it before he signed it if he were able to do so and his failure to obtain a reading and explanation of it is such gross negligence as will estop him from avoiding it on the ground that he was ignorant of its contents" (Italics supplied).</blockquote><br>The requisites of reformation of a contract as enumerated in Article 1359 of the Civil Code are:<br><br><ol><li>There must have been a meeting of the minds to a contract;<br><br></li><li>The instrument or document evidencing the contract does not express the true intention of the parties; and<br><br></li><li>The failure of the instrument to express the true intention of the parties must be due to mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct or accident.</li></ol><br>The reason why reformation is not available here is that contrary to the second requisite, the promissory notes in question do express the true intention of the parties as to the terms of the two loans.<br><br>As to the holding of the trial court that certain collaterals should be released, well entrenched in law is the rule that a mortgage directly and immediately subjects the property upon which it is imposed [Article 2126, Civil Code], the same being indivisible even though the debt may be divided [Article 2089, Ibid.] and such indivisibility likewise being unaffected by the fact that the debtors are not solidarily liable [Article 2090, <i>Ibid</i>.]....<br><br>All told, the intention of the parties is quite clear to the effect that the term of the two loans is not 6 years, but up to May 2, 1984 only; so also their intentions in their Consultancy Contract and Real Estate Mortgages.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>Since their motion for a reconsideration of the decision was denied, the petitioners filed on 24 September 1993 the instant petition for review.&nbsp; They impute to the Court of Appeals the commission of the following errors:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A GRAVE MISAPPREHENSION OF THE FACTS AND A GROSS MISAPPRECIATION OF THE EVIDENCE WHEN IT HELD THAT THE TERM OF THE LOANS OF PETITIONERS WITH PRIVATE RESPONDENT SIHI IS SIXTY (60) DAYS ONLY, AND NOT SIX (6) YEARS AS CLEARLY BORNE OUT BY THE EVIDENCE AND THE RECORD OF THIS CASE AS WELL AS RESPONDENT SIHI'S DOCUMENTS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A PATENT AND GRAVE REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT DID NOT DECLARE NULL AND VOID THE COLLECTION OF CONSULTANCY FEES BY THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT SIHI.&nbsp; THE COLLECTION THEREOF BEING UNJUSTIFIED AND INVALID.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT UPHOLDING THE DECISION OF THE LOWER COURT ORDERING THE RELEASE OF EXCESS COLLATERALS IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONERS.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS, IN SUMMARILY DENYING PETITIONERS' MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, VIOLATED THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V<br></div><br>THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT AWARDING DAMAGES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONERS.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br>The parties themselves are to be blamed for the difficulty in determining the term of the loans in question and the disagreement thereon between the trial court and the Court of Appeals.&nbsp; For reasons only known to themselves, they did not disclose to the trial court all the pieces of evidence which could establish their true agreement as to such term.&nbsp; The Gobonsengs did not ask for the production of the entire records of their transactions with SIHI which necessarily started with their application for a credit line.&nbsp; Neither did SIHI offer them in evidence.&nbsp; The application and the approval thereof would shed much light on the issue, yet SIHI opted to suppress from the court he said records.&nbsp; SIHI's Vice-President, Augusto Lopez-Dee, proved to be of little help since he could not categorically testify that the actual term of the credit facility was six years.

As a matter of fact, an amount of P7,417.86 was credited to the principal in the promissory note with the code IF-84-CB022-GG<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup> per Official Receipt No. 14173 dated 2 May 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup> This partial payment for the principal clearly proves that the interest due had been paid.&nbsp; Article 1253 of the Civil Code provides that if the debt produces interest, payment of the principal shall not be deemed to have been made until the interests have been covered.&nbsp; Consequently, automatic renewal of the loans by way of promissory notes for the succeeding interest period was unavoidable.<br><br>Indisputably, the application for foreclosure of the mortgage on 9 June 1984<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup> was premature because by then, the Gobonsengs had not yet defaulted on the payments of either the principal or the interest of their loans.&nbsp; As the Gobonsengs stated in their 25 May 1994 letter to Shirley Uy, the interest on the P800,000.00 loan for the period ending 2 July 1994 had already been pre-paid on 2 May 1994, and the payment for the interest on the P900,000.00 loan was due at the end of the next term which was 13 July 1994 yet.&nbsp; SIHI never controverted these claims by the Gobonsengs and so we are constrained to accept them as true.&nbsp; Nevertheless, because the Gobonsengs did not pay the remaining unpaid portion of the principal and the interests due thereon every sixty days thereafter at any time after the foreclosure proceedings were initiated, the real estate mortgages could have been validly foreclosed after the Gobonsengs failed to make payments and even if the Gobonsengs are correct and the term of the credit line was six years, which then expired on 19 January 1989.<br><br>Likewise, there is no evidence that the Gobonsengs had made any payment on the interest and on the unpaid balance of the principal even after the filing of Civil Case No. 8428.&nbsp; The payment therefor has long become overdue. Justice and equity demand that they be required to pay them within thirty days from their receipt of this decision, otherwise the real estate mortgages maybe foreclosed.<br><br>On the amount purportedly due SIHI as consultancy fees, we agree with the trial court that it has no basis in fact.&nbsp; As correctly found by it, SIHI had not communicated to the Gobonsengs, as required in the consultancy contract, the nature and extent of its consultancy services and had not presented to them a bill therefor based on manhours spent in the rendition thereof. There is no proof that SIHI performed its obligation under the consultancy contract (Exhibits "UU" and "8"), which is "to render financial consultancy services to the Gobonsengs for the formulation of financial plans, financial advisory matters and financial packaging for medium and long term capital requirements." The consultancy fees thus paid were not legally due for absence of proof of its rendition and must be returned to the Gobonsengs.&nbsp; However, by way of set-off, the fees already paid by the Gobonsengs may be applied as partial payment of the interests due on the principal of the loans in question.&nbsp; They are not to be treated as interests, contrary to the view of the trial court, because SIHI is an "investment" house, and as such it can render the above mentioned consultancy services for which fees can be charged.<br><br>Finally, the release of alleged excess collaterals is unwarranted.&nbsp; The Gobonsengs voluntarily offered the collaterals and they did not protest when the credit line was reduced from P2 million to P900,000.00 after a re-appraisal of the loan value of the collaterals.&nbsp; They did not even intimate in their complaint a desire for the return of excess collaterals.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.&nbsp; The challenged decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
