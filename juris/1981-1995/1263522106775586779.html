Private respondent Juliana C. Vista, a public school teacher of San 
Andres, Catanduanes was appointed poll clerk by the Commission on 
Elections in Precinct No. 25 of San Andres in the general elections of 
November 9, 1965.
<p>
Petitioner Francisco A. Perfecto, a retired public service commissioner,
 was a candidate for congressman of the lone district of Catanduanes.  
He lost in that election.
</p><p>
In August 1967, petitioner filed with the Commission on Elections an 
administrative complaint against the members of the board of election 
inspectors of Precinct No. 25 of San Andres, namely:  Roberto Reyes, 
Chairman; Felicidad Garcia, Nacionalista Party inspector; Jorge Primo, 
Liberal Party inspector; and herein private respondent Juliana C. Vista,
 poll clerk of said precinct.  The complaint charged that the said 
members of the board of election inspectors were guilty of non-feasance,
 malfeasance and misfeasance for wilfull failure to comply with the 
instructions, orders, decisions and rulings of the Commission in 
connection with the performance of their duties relative to the conduct 
of the elections of 1965, committed in the following manner, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That during voting time on November 9, 1965, being an election 
day, in Precinct No. 25 located at the Public School Building in the 
Barrio of Bislig, Municipality of San Andres, Catanduanes, Philippines, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Commission, the 
above-named respondents conspiring, confederating, collaborating and 
mutually helping each other did then and there wilfully, criminally, 
feloniously and unlawfully - </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(a)    tolerate, allow and permit numerous registered voters of
 said precinct to prepare their ballots with the use of carbon paper or 
means for making copies of the ballots to identify the votes of said 
voters in violation of Sec. 135 of the Revised Election Code; </p>
    <p> "(b)    tolerate, allow and permit said voters to cast their 
unlawfully prepared ballots, and further tolerate, allow and permit said
 voters to step out of the polling place with the unlawfully made copies
 of the ballots, in their possession; </p>
    <p> "(c)    prevent the filing of protests and refuse to give 
protest forms to in spite of lawful demands by the Nacionalista election
 watchers who wanted to file their protests, against the manner of 
voting above-described; </p>
    <p> "(d)    accept the unlawfully prepared ballots and placed them 
in the box for valid ballots and later read, counted and credited them 
in favor of the candidates whose names were written thereon including 
Jose M. Alberto who was also a candidate for the same position as the 
complainant; </p>
    <p> "(e)    falsify the truth by making it appear in their official 
records that there were no anomalies in the voting and no protests 
against anomalies; </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
all of which unlawful acts violated the free and untrammeled expression 
of the sovereign will of the people and caused damage to the 
complainant." (pp. 45-46, Rollo)
</p><p>
As a consequence, private respondent Juliana Vista, assisted by her 
husband Vicente Vista, filed an action for damages alleging that the 
above charges were false and without basis had been instituted 
maliciously in order to harass, annoy, demean, degrade and expose her to
 public ridicule and because of which she suffered "mental torture, 
anguish, sleepless nights, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, 
mental shock and social humiliation which may be assessed as moral 
damages in the amount of P120,000.00." Further, she "claims the further 
sum of P15,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P10,000.00 for attorney's 
fees and expenses in the prosecution of the suit." (p. 46, Rollo)
</p><p>
Answering the complaint for damages, herein petitioner Francisco A. 
Perfecto avers that the filing of the administrative complaint against 
private respondent Vista and the members of the board of election 
inspectors of Precinct No. 25 was done in good faith with the highest 
motive of bringing to justice persons who have violated the laws of the 
land; that he never had any personal grudge or ill-feeling against 
private respondent previously and his only purpose in filing the 
administrative complaint was to deter the commission of the acts charged
 for the sake of democracy; that he even asked for the dismissal of all 
administrative cases he had filed against many teachers in their conduct
 of the 1965 elections because he had no intention of demeaning and 
degrading them and because he was satisfied with the action taken by the
 Commission in connection with the election cases in the provinces of 
Batanes and Cotabato.
</p><p>
Evidence shows that private respondent Vista was the poll clerk of 
Precinct No. 25 of San Andres during the elections of 1965.  However, it
 had been shown successfully that she did not act as poll clerk on 
election day, November 9, 1965 because she was ill and had been running 
with fever for several days prior to the election.  In fact, she was 
substituted by Nazaria B. Reyes, another public school teacher as poll 
clerk on that day.  The trial court on this point said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x The best and most reliable proof showing the identities of 
the officials of Precinct No. 25 who reported for duty on November 9, 
1965, is the minutes of voting which is supposed to be the authentic 
record of the proceedings in the precinct during election day (Exhibit 
A) and the election return showing the result of the canvass of the 
votes in the precinct which are all required to be accomplished and 
signed by the chairman and members of the board of election inspectors 
including the poll clerk.  In both documents it appears that Mrs. 
Nazaria B. Reyes, the substitute poll clerk, acted as poll clerk on 
election day in place of the regular poll clerk, the plaintiff, who was 
absent and did not report for duty." (p. 49, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, the lower court "failed to find sufficient proof to sustain the
 charge that in filing the administrative complaint with the Commission 
on Elections the defendant was acting with malice and for the sole 
purpose of degrading or besmirching the reputation of the plaintiff and 
exposing her to public ridicule.  The very complaint itself shows upon 
itself that it was not directed solely at the plaintiff but was in fact 
against all the members of the board of election inspectors of Precinct 
No. 25 of which the plaintiff was only the poll clerk.  In fact it would
 appear from a fair and impartial appraisal of the charges that the 
major responsibility is lodged against the chairman and the two other 
inspectors who by law control the proceedings in the board.  The poll 
clerk is comparatively a minor official in the board and there is 
nothing in the complaint which will show that it was directed solely for
 the purpose of harassing and injuring the reputation of the plaintiff. 
 The chairman and the two other election inspectors who were made 
respondents have not taken offense and their conduct induces the 
impression that they either did not feel aggrieved or felt that the 
dismissal of the complaint was enough vindication of their honor if in 
one way or another it became involved as a result of the charges.  x x x
 Under the circumstances, the action taken by the defendant can hardly 
be construed as motivated by malice and intended to harass and injure 
her reputation." (pp. 50-51, Rollo) Notwithstanding, the lower court 
rendered judgment ordering herein petitioner to indemnify private 
respondent the sum of P2,000.00 as compensatory damages.
</p><p>
Hence, the filing of this petition for review by way of <em>certiorari </em>to set aside the order of respondent judge in awarding private respondent compensatory damages in the amount of P2,000.00.
</p><p>
There is merit in the petition.  Respondent judge found no basis for 
actual or compensatory damages and exemplary damages when it said that 
"to slap a heavy damage upon the defendant would be tantamount to 
imposing a prohibitive premium upon the filing of complaints against 
public officials for misconduct in office, a policy that is neither 
sound nor conducive to a healthy development of civic courage and public
 interest so necessary and indispensable in the conduct of the affairs 
of the government (pp. 53-54, Rollo)." Besides, actual or compensatory 
damages are those recoverable because of pecuniary loss - in business, 
trade, property, profession, job, or occupation, and the same must be 
proved, otherwise, if the proof is flimsy and non-substantial, no 
damages will be given.  In the case of Malonzo vs. Galang, 109 Phil. 16,
 the Court, speaking through Justice J. B. L. Reyes, held that with 
respect to compensatory damages assuming that they are recoverable under
 the theory that petitioner had filed a clearly unfounded suit against 
respondent, the same constitutes a tort against the latter that makes 
the former liable for all damages which are the natural and probable 
consequences of the act or omissions complained of.  These damages, 
cannot, however, be presumed and must be duly proved (Article 2199, New 
Civil Code).  Well settled is the rule that even if the complaint filed 
by one against the other is clearly unfounded this does not necessarily 
mean, in the absence of specific facts proving damages, that said 
defendant really suffered actual damage over and above attorney's fees 
and costs.  The Court cannot rely on its speculations as to the fact and
 amount of damages.  It must depend on actual proof of the damages 
alleged to have been suffered.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED and the order of respondent judge 
condemning petitioner Francisco A. Perfecto to pay compensatory damages 
of P2,000.00 is hereby SET ASIDE.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, J.</em>, no part.
</p><p>
<em>Plana, J.</em>, in the result.
