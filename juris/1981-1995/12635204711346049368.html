				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>The accused Francisco
Centeno alias &quot;Panchito&quot;, Juan Centeno alias &quot;Totok&quot;, and
Manuel Centeno alias &quot;Iyao&quot; were originally charged with the crime of
Murder in an information filed by the Provincial Fiscal of Iloilo on 10 July
1972.  After trial, the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo, Branch IV, found them guilty of Homicide, hence this
appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>The evidence for the
prosecution is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>The three accused,
FRANCISCO Centeno, JUAN Centeno and MANUEL Centeno are brothers.  They are all residents of Barrio Malayuan,
Ajuy, Iloilo.  FRANCISCO, the eldest, </span>was
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>the Barrio Captain of the place having
held the position for four terms.  They
had another brother, Florentino, who was married to one Ester Causing with whom
he had two children.  This couple converted
a portion of the seashore of Barrio Malayuan into a docking place for a motor
boat named Evelyn III owned by Serafin Opinion, Jr.  This boat used to ferry passengers and cargo from Barrio
Malayuan, Ajuy to Victorias, Negros Occidental, and back.  The spouses Florentino Centeno and Ester
Causing operated this motor boat, receiving commissions for every passenger and
cargo carried.  A commission of P2.00
each was also being paid to the accused, FRANCISCO, JUAN, MANUEL and another
brother, use, for helping </span>in <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>the
operation of the motor boat.  The couple
had an errand boy named Nestor Asistido, who was also being paid a commission
of P2.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>On 4 November 1971,
Florentino Centeno was mur­dered in Sara, </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>Iloilo.  His<span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'> </span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>wife, Ester Causing received an indemnity of P60,000.00 as the
beneficiary of his life insurance policy.  The persons who were responsible for the crime were not prosecuted, and
the three accused blamed the widow for this.  A feel­ing of enmity developed between them particularly because both
parties sought to gain control </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>of
</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>the management of the boat.  Nestor Asistido, however, remained loyal to
the widow, who promised to see him through school, which fact the accused
inwardly resented.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>In the afternoon of 21
November 1971, the father of Nestor, Arsenio Asistido, was warned by accused
MANUEL Centeno that if he (Arsenio) would allow Nestor to stay with Ester,
their sister-in-law, they would kill him (Nestor) in less than <span
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>six </span>days.  Arsenio told </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>his
son </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>about MANUEL's threat.  Nestor, however, informed his father that if
Ester could withdraw the proceeds of the life insurance of her husband, she
would transfer her family to Manila and would also </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>send </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>Nestor to school there.  That
same afternoon, Arsenio went to see Ester and related what MANUEL had threatened
to do.  Ester gave him a letter for the
Mayor of Ajuy and he was informed afterwards that the matter was already
settled at a conference before Police Sergeant Vicente Alamon which was
attended by MANUEL and JUAN, on the one hand, and Arsenio Asistido, on the
other, where the Sgt. succeeded in making them shake hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Notwithstanding, the
following day, 12 November 1971, Arsenio Asistido met accused FRANCISCO
Centeno, and the latter told him, &quot;Tay Arsing last night your house where
your son is living and your house in the seashore was being guarded.&quot; The
next day, Arsenio and FRANCISCO met again in the house of Augusto Leonides, the
Secretary of the Mayor, and FRANCISCO said to him, &quot;Tay Arsing, you were
fortunate last night that you did not come out of your house.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>At noon of 1 December
1971, Nestor was in the house of his parents at Barrio Malayuan.  He set the table for his father, who, after
taking his lunch, left immediately for school where he was serving as janitor.  Between 1:00 to 2:00 o'clock that afternoon,
Nestor went to the house of Capid (Inocencia Basa) and Esteban Matulac alias
&quot;Tiban&quot; which was near the beach of Malayuan where the M/V Evelyn III</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:31.0pt'> </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>was
docked.  He played bingo with Jesus
Artesilla, Capid and her two sons and Rodel Sariya.  Not long after, the three accused arrived, FRANCISCO was armed
with a shot gun, JUAN Centeno, with a .38 caliber pistol, and MANUEL, with a
greasegun.  They called Nestor, and when
the latter </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>did not come out, </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>MANUEL and JUAN went up the house </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>while </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>FRANCISCO </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>remained </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>downstairs.  Thuds were heard and Nestor cried out, &quot;Manong Totok I am not going
to </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>fight back.&quot; </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The people inside the house </span>jumped out
except Jesus Artesilla.  The brothers, <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>JUAN and MANUEL dragged Nestor to the door </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>and </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>pushed him towards the stairs.  As they did so, FRANCISCO Centeno fired his gun at Nestor; the latter
was hit and fell to the ground.  Then
JUAN and MANUEL fired their guns at him.  FRANCISCO then turned to the peo­ple around and threatened them not to
reveal to anyone what had happened.  Eyewitnesses to the incident in the house were Jesus Artesilla, who was
one of the bingo players, and a tuba gatherer of JUAN, Teofisto </span>Domegillo,
a fish vendor, who happened to be in the vicinity to buy fish (t.s.n., p. 4,
Tauro) Pedro <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Nobleza, who was also
there to sail for Negros in the M/V Evelyn III, (t.s.n., p. 27, C.M. Tauro) and
Bienvenido Brabo who had a house nearby.  Scared, all of them left after the occurrence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>JUAN and MANUEL
thereafter dragged the body of Nestor towards a place where tall grasses grew
near </span>the house of Bienvenido Bravo.  At about 5:00 o'clock that same afternoon, Jesus Artesilla, while atop a
coconut tree <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>gathering </span>&quot;tuba&quot;
saw the body of Nestor Asistido in a supine position.  He went down the tree and approached the body and saw that it was
already lifeless.  He even closed the
eyes of Nestor.  Panfilo <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Besana also saw the body of the victim at
about 5:30 that same afternoon when he went to the cogon grasses to answer a
call of nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>At about 8:00 o'clock in
the evening, the three accused together with Jesus Artesilla and Bienvenido
Brabo moved the body of Nestor Asistido from the tall grasses.  The accused ordered Artesilla and Bravo to
wrap the body in a fishing net owned by Bravo.  Then JUAN and MANUEL loaded the body in a bance and peddled towards the
sea.  They returned to shore about 4:00
o'clock the following morning with­out the body of Nestor, which was never
recovered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The respective defense of
the accused is alibi.  FRANCISCO </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>maintained </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

16.0pt'>1971 </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>to </span>3
December 1971, he contracted the <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>services
</span>of 14 labor<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>ers to pull </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>grasses, transplant </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>seedling and clean the canals of his farm,
which is in sitio Tigbao Centeno, two kilometers away from Barrio
Malayuan.  He alleged that he and his
hired laborers worked in the farm from 7:30 in the morning to 4:00 o'clock in
the afternoon on 1 December 1971, and that he never </span>left the field.  In fact, they had their lunch there, which
was prepared by his wife and another woman.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>In his turn, JUAN claimed
that from 26 November 1971 he plowed his field which is situated at </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>Sitio </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>Bitac, one kilometer away from Barrio Malayuan.  He stated that, on the day of the incident
or 1 December 1971, he was at his ricefield managing the transplanting of the
rice seedlings, and that he never left the field until 5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon of that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Accused MANUEL, for his
part, claimed that on 1 December 1971 he painted the motorboat M/V Evelyn III
which was docked about 350 meters from the house of Esteban Matulac where the
incident occurred, from 7:00 o'clock in the morning to 4:00 o'clock in the
afternoon.  He likewise alleged that he
never left his job because they were being watched by Custodio Flores, who was
in charged of the repair of the boat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The three accused
likewise contended that the witnesses for the prosecution testified for
monetary considerations and upon instigation of their sister-­in-law Ester
Causing.  Their testimonies as to their
respective alibi were corroborated </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>by
</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Rafael Sumatra and Florenio Gonzales

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>After trial on the
merits, the lower court ruled out treachery and evident premeditation and held
the accused guilty, not of Murder, but of Homicide, in a judgment, the dispositive

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>From said decision, the

<blockquote><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt'>&quot;1.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span></span>The
trial Court erred into believing the testimonies of witnesses characterized by
queer­ness and incredibility as they are and narration of witnesses who came
out to testify against the accused&#8209;appellants eight months after the
alleged incident and erred to assume by probabilities and accused-appel­lands
were responsible for the death of Nestor Asistido.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;2.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span>The trial Court erred in finding the accused-appellants
guilty of the crime charged des­pite improbabilities and the absence of corpus
delictic.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>From the facts established, We find this, appeal without merit.</p>

<p class=BODY>In all crimes against persons in which the death of the victim is
an element of the offense, there must be satisfactory evidence of the fact of
death and the identity of the victim.  That a crime has been committed, which is what <u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>corpus</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'> <u>delicti</u> </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>really
means, (People v. Sanchez, 89 Phil. 423 (1951) and there is evidence linking
the accused to the crime, has been dearly and positively established by the
testimonies of our eyewitnesses to its commission.  That it was committed at the place testified to by those
witnesses is substantiated by the findings of Capt. Balaois, who conducted an
investigation, showing the pool of blood inside the house of Inocencia Basa;
the traces of blood leading to a bigger pool of blood at the foot of the stairs
(Exhibits B, B-1 to B-5); and the blood trails which showed that the body of
the victim was dragged through rice paddies and coco­nut grove until the trail
was finally lost.  </span><u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Corpus</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'> <u>delicti</u>, </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>therefore,
has been dearly established.  The
failure of the prosecution to produce the body </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>of </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>the victim does not
imply the absence of </span><u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>corpus</span></u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> <u>delicti</u> </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>(People v. Mones, 58 Phil. 46 (1933) for the
term does not refer to the body of the murdered person (People v. Taruc, et
als., G.R. No. L-18308, April 30, 1966, 16 SCRA 834).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The appellants, however,
assail the credibility of prosecution witnesses in that they testified against
them eight months after the incident.  Notwithstanding, this factor will not assist the defense any for it has
been held that the initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information
about a criminal case and their unwillingness to be involved in or dragged into
a criminal investigation is common and has been judicially declared not to
affect credibility (People v. Estocada, 75 SCRA 295 (1977).  Moreover, there is evidence on record
showing that prosecution witnesses were being threatened by the appellants, one
of whom is a Barrio Captain, consequently, they were afraid to report to the
authorities what they knew about the incident.  Witness Jesus Artesilla even transferred his residence to Carlos,
Iloilo, for fear of his life.  It was
only after the declaration of martial law that he summoned courage to reveal
what he had seen (t.s.n., February 13, 1973, pp. 4 and 25).  Witness Teofisto Demegillo also admitted
that he was afraid of the Centeno brothers.  In fact, the mother of the victim, Nenita Asistido, had to seek the
assistance of the Philippine Constabulary to get the witnesses and to prevent
the appellants from threatening them (Exhibit &quot;G&quot;), so much so that
the latter had to be kept in the PC stockade for a time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Nonetheless, eyewitness Pedro
Nobleza informed </span>the victim's mother of the occurrence so that in the
same afternoon of December 1, 1971, the father, Arsenio, reported to the Mayor
that the three accus<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>sed had killed his son;
while on December 3, 1971, the mother, Nenita, reported to the police that the
accused had shot their son to death (Exhibit &quot;3&quot;).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The defense challenges
the credibility of eye&#8209;witness Teofisto Demegillo on the ground that he
is a relative of the deceased.  It is
well-settled, </span>however, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt'>that </span>relationship
<u>per</u> <u>se</u> does not necessarily <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>render
the testimony of a witness incredible.  Besides, the same witness testified that the appellants are his
godbrothers (t.s.n., October 17, 1972, p. 21).  </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt'>In </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>fact, he even called them &quot;Igsoon&quot;
meaning &quot;brother&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Eyewitness Pedro
Nobleza's testimony is also as­sailed as a mere reiteration of that of Teofisto
Deme­gillo.  However, each of them
happened to be at the scene of the crime under different circumstances.  Demegillo, as a fish vendor, had to buy
fish.  While Nobleza intended to take
the boat and sail for Negros.  Their
testimonies are corroborative of the other, and </span>are further strengthened
by those of Jesus Artesilla and Bienvenido Bravo, two other eyewitnesses.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Panfilo Besana's
testimony is also denounced as inconsistent when he said that the incident
&quot;happened a long time ago but up to the present it is not known.&quot;
However, that was followed immediately by his state­ment &quot;I told them that
one time when I went to answer the call of nature, I saw the cadaver (t.s.n.,
December 26, 1972, p. 42).  The witness
must have been referring, therefore, to knowledge by the community, </span>but
as to himself, he knew about the crime because he actually saw the cadaver when
he went to answer the call of nature.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>And as to the presence of
rocks or spades in the banca, all that Jesus Artesilla declared was </span>that
he did not see any, but not that the accused <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>JUAN and MANUEL did not carry any rocks or spades in their banca when
they took the body of the victim with </span>them out to sea.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>The fact that Capt.
Balaois testified that he was not sure that the trail of blood was human blood
will not serve to destroy his credibility, but on the contrary enhances it for
he truthfully said that he </span>was not an expert on that.</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>And while it may be that
when the father of the victim, Arsenio Asistido, went to the scene of the crime
in the afternoon of December 1, 1972, he did </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>not find his son's body, this may be explained by the fact that it was
almost dark when he and his party went so that there was little chance of
locating the victim's body which was hidden among tall cogon grasses.  It was only the investigation the next day
by Capt. Balaois that disclosed the traces of blood (Exhibits B, B-1, B-6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>In the last analysis, the conclusions reached by a trial Court on
the question of credibility is entitled to great weight, and should ordinarily
be respected as it is in a better position to determine such matters, unless a
fact or circumstance of weight or influence has been overlooked and its
significance misinterpreted (People v. Monteverde, L-31177, July 15, 1976, 72
SCRA 69).  We find the required except­ions
absent herein.  The testimonies of
prosecution witnesses are straight forward and consistent on mater­ial points,
the contradictions and inconsistencies pointed out by the defense trivial and
insignificant, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>such that we can see no
reason to disturb the conclusions reached by the trial Court in so far as their
credibility is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The defense of each the appellants in this case is that of
alibi.  It is fundamental that this must
be supported by clear and convincing evidence to be <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt'>given full faith and credence.  Alibi is not credible when there appears no physical impossibility on
the part of those invoking it to have been at the scene of the crime (People v.
Estocado, 75 SCRA 295 (1977).  In this
case, appellant FRANCISCO was only two kilometers away from the situs of the
incident; JUAN, one kilometer, and MANUEL, 350 meters away.  It was not impossible for them, therefore,
to have left their alleged places of work or activity and to have gone to the
house where they committed the offense.  Besides, the rule is also well-settled that alibi can not prevail over
the positive identification of the accused by competent witnesses whose
credibility is unassailable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>We come now to the nature of the crime committed.  The trial Court categorized it as
Homicide.  We dis­agree.  As aptly pointed out by the Solicitor
General, whose views We hereby adopt, the circumstances of treachery and
evident premeditation are clearly attendant herein.  Thus,</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The Information charging the accused of Murder notes the
attend­ance of two qualifying circumstances–treachery and evident
premeditation.  According to the Revised
Penal Code, there is treachery 'when the offender commits any of the crimes
against per­sons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof
which tend directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to him­self
arising from the defense which <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt'>the
offended party might make' Article </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>14,
par. 6, Revised Penal Code).  In short,
two conditions must concur:  (1) the
employment </span>of <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>means, method </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>or manner </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>of execution which would insure </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>the </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>offenders' safety
from any defensive or retaliatory act on the part of the offended party, which
means that no opportunity is given</span> the latter to do so (People v.
Casalme, <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>17 SCRA 717 (1966); and (2)
that such means, method, or manner of </span>execution was deliberately or
consciously chosen (People v. Dadis 18 SCRA 699 (1966).</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;In the case at bar, the treacherous manner in which the
victim was killed is manifest from the re­cord.  Nestor Asistido was mauled by Juan Centeno and Manuel Centeno
inside Basa's house, despite his protestations that he was not going <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>to fight back.   When he was already weak, bloodied, and unable </span>to defend
himself, he was dragged <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>to the
door.  Juan and Manuel Centeno held </span>him
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>on both hands.  While he was being pushed down the stairs,
Francisco Centeno fired his gun at him.  It should further be noted that the victim was unarmed, in contrast to
the accused who were each armed with firearms.  Nestor Asistido was a young man of nineteen (19) years.  He </span>was <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>no match for three robust men like the accused.  The fact that the accused went to the place
of Basa fully armed, is an indication that the means of execution they employed
was deliberate or consciously chosen.  After Francisco fired his gun at the victim the latter fell to the
ground.  Yet, </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>Juan </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>and Manuel Centeno still fired their guns at the fallen vic­tim.  All the earmarks of alevosia are present in
this case.  We cannot see how anyone
else can arrived at a different conclusion.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;We also submit that the aggravating circumstance of evident
premeditation has been proven in this case.  The plan of the accused to kill Nestor Asistido made itself manifest as
early as November 21, 1971.  On said
date Manuel Centeno informed Arsenio Asistido that if he would allow his son
Nestor to stay with <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Ester Causing, they
would kill Nestor in less than six (6) days.  (pp. 5-6. tsn., October 17, 1972).  It is true that the Mayor of Ajuy tried to settle matters between the
Asistido's on the one hand and the accused Centeno's on the other hand.  The accused Juan and Manuel Centeno appeared
cordial during their confrontation, but the subse­quent </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>events </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>that followed show that the accused have not desisted from their
original plan to kill Nestor.  The
following day, when Arsenio Asistido met Francisco Centeno, the latter ex­pressed
their original threat, (pp. tsn., October 17, 1972).  The same threat was reiterated once more by Francisco Centeno on
November 23, 1971.  On December 1, 1971,
the accused went to the house of Inocencia Basa, fully armed.  There is no showing that they went to this
place for any reason other than to kill Nestor </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>Asistido.  The con</span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>tuinity of </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>these events, </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>buttressed
further by the treachery employed to kill the </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>victim, </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>show the
persistence of the accused to carry out the criminal intent they had originally
hatched.  (People v. Tapitan, 27 SCRA
959).  Sufficient time had lapsed from
November 21, 1971, when the intent of the accused to kill made itself manifest
for the first time, until December 1, 1971, when the crime was committed.  This had given the accused sufficient
opportunity to reflect and deliberate upon the consequences of their act.  All these characterize the aggravating
circumstance of evident premeditation.&quot; (Appellee's Brief, pp. 18-20).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>Treachery being present,
the aggravating circum­stance of abuse of superior strength appreciated by the trial
Court can no longer be considered as a separate generic aggravating
circumstance since it must be deemed absorbed in treachery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>As to the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender, the same is not borne put by the
evidence.  By their own admission,
appellants were arrested by the authorities (t.s.n., June 19, 1973, </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>p. </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>75; November 5, 1973, p. 54).  They never made any attempt to give themselves up prior to their arrest
nor to save the authorities from any trouble in their search and capture.  On the contrary, </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>FRANCISCO and JUAN </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>even tried to evade the processes issued to
them to secure their </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>presence </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>during the preliminary investigation
conducted by the Special Counsel (Exhibits A, A-1; 1-A).  With respect to MANUEL, who was studying in
Manila, the records show that the prosecution had already presented its
evidence against </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>FRANCISCO and
JUAN </span>before MANUEL was allegedly informed by his lawyer of this criminal
charge against him such that prosecution witnesses had to be recalled to the
stand to testify on his participation in the commission of the offense.<a

Therefore, the crime committed was that of murder and in the absence of any
