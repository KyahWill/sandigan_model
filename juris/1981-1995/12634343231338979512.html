Court of Masbate<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

in Criminal Case No. 5513, dated February 14, 1990, finding Roger Arevalo and
Edgar Blancaflor guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime with which they
were charged, the murder of Reynaldo Hernandez.  Blancaflor was thereby sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and
Arevalo, in view of the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender
appreciated in his favor, to an "indeterminate sentence of TEN (10) YEARS
of Prision Mayor as minimum to EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS of reclusion temporal as
maximum."  The judgment also
ordered both accused "to indemnify the heirs of the deceased, jointly and
severally, (in) the amount of Thirty Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos, without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the cost."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The information which initiated the criminal action against
Arevalo and Blancaflor alleged that in the evening of April 3, 1988, at Balud,
Masbate, both accused, "confederating together and helping one another,
with intent to kill, evident premeditation, treachery, superiority of strength
and taking advantage of nighttime, did ** wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously
attack, assault, shoot with (a) gun and stab with a machete, one Reynaldo
Hernandez, hitting him on ** different parts of his body, thereby inflicting
wounds, which caused his instantaneous death."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In proof of these allegations, the State called four (4)
witnesses to the stand, namely:  Dr.
Jovellano Aguilar, Jr. -- who did the autopsy of the deceased Reynaldo
Hernandez; Police Corporal Harry Estrella  -- to whom Roger Arevalo surrendered; and two (2) eyewitnesses:  Honorato Navarro -- the owner of the house
in which the slaying took place; and Pasolita Catalan -- who was in the house
at the time of the occurrence.  The
facts established by the evidence of these witnesses are hereunder summarized.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In celebration of the graduation from high school of his son,
Fernando, Honorato Navarro gave a party at his home in the municipality of
Balud, Masbate Province, in the evening of April 3, 1988.  One of the invited guests was Reynaldo
Hernandez, who came at about 7 o'clock.  Honorato seated him on a bench in the upper story of the house, near a
window, and gave him a glass of <i>tuba</i>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Also invited were Honorato's parents, Pito Basal, Vicing Basal,
Inday Mangaarin, Pasolita Catalan and her husband, Sofronio Catalan, as well as
the two accused, Roger Arevalo and Edgar Blancaflor, and their spouses.  Roger and Edgar did not go upstairs.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">At about 8:30 o'clock that
night, the guests were startled by the sound of a shot.  Honorato Navarro, who was then seated beside
Reynaldo Hernandez, at once noticed that Reynaldo had been shot on the right
side of the head.  He jumped up from the
bench and went to the door.  He saw
Roger Arevalo, who was standing in the yard, about one and a half meters lower
than the second story of Honorato's house.  Arevalo was holding a gun, about two feet long, with the barrel pointed
upward.  At this point, Honorato
realized that he himself had also been wounded because blood was dripping from
his head, and he felt dizzy.  He called
out to his father to bring him to the hospital.  As he was being helped out by his father, he saw Reynaldo
Hernandez prostrate on the floor.  He
later learned that Reynaldo had died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When the shot rang out, Pasolita Catalan, another guest, was
sitting near the door.  She saw Reynaldo
Hernandez begin to slump towards the floor.  She also saw Edgar Blancaflor at the window beside which Reynaldo had
been sitting, and saw Edgar stab Reynaldo at the right side of the neck with a
knife.  She also noticed Roger Arevalo
standing by the door, holding a gun.  Roger was trying to get in but Pasolita blocked the doorway and
prevented him from entering the room.  Reynaldo fell to the floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The wives of Roger Arevalo and Edgar Blancaflor then came and
brought them away from the place.  It
appears that Edgar and Roger are brothers-in-law, Roger's younger sister being
Edgar's wife.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Jovellano Aguilar, Jr., the municipal health officer of
Balud, conducted a post-mortem examination of the victim, Reynaldo
Hernandez.  He testified that Reynaldo
had been shot in the head with a shotgun, which caused an injury "so
devastating (that) the lower mandible was fractured into pieces," and some
pellets pierced the brain.  Reynaldo had
also been stabbed in the neck, the injury being a "through and through
wound," hitting a "big artery."  Both wounds were fatal; either would have produced death.  In the death certificate, Dr. Aguilar
entered the cause of death as shock, secondary to brain injury due (to) shotgun
wound, face and hemorrhage due to stab wound."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pasolita Catalan and her husband, Sofronio, reported the killing
to Police Corporal Harry Estrella at his house in Balud.  After obtaining permission from the station
commander, Corporal Estrella went to the scene of the crime to conduct an
investigation.  He came upon Reynaldo
Hernandez in the house of Honorato Navarro, lying on the floor, near the door
of the small balcony.  No one else was
in the house.  He caused the body of
Reynaldo to be brought to his family's house.  He next went to look for Roger Arevalo and Edgar Blancaflor but could
not find them that night.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, Roger Arevalo's wife went to Estrella and told
him Roger wished to surrender but was fearful of retaliation by the victim's
relatives.  Estrella then accompanied
Roger's wife to Biulan, Balud, Masbate, where he found Roger, at his cousin's
house.  He brought Roger to the police
station and there interrogated him.  Roger allegedly stated "that he was the one who shot" Reynaldo
Hernandez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the accused testified in their defense.  Edgar Blancaflor denied having gone to the
house of Honorato Navarro on April 3, 1988, insisting that from 6:00 o'clock in
the morning of that day, up to 6:00 o'clock in the morning of April 4, 1988, he
was in his house at the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">poblacion</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,<i> </i></span>Balud, Masbate.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Roger Arevalo admitted that it was he who shot and
stabbed Reynaldo ("Rene") Hernandez, but asserts he did so in
self-defense.  According to him, after
deciding to go home from the party, and as he was stepping out of the kitchen
door on the ground floor of Honorato Navarro's house, he felt two knife thrusts
in the back.  He looked back and saw
that it was Rene who had wounded him (with a ten-inch knife) and was even then
at the point of stabbing him yet a third time.  He quickly drew his own knife and thrust it at Rene, hitting him on the
left side of the neck.  Roger saw that
Rene was also holding a gun.  He wrested
the gun away from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rene, ran up </span>and
then down the house, and sought to take cover at one side of it.  However, he soon saw that Rene had caught
sight of him, and from a window in the upper floor was poised to
"spin" (throw) a bolo at him.  So he shot Rene.</p>

<p class="BODY">Asked "why, despite the fact that you have not done anything
bad, and you have not done anything that could provoke ** a fight between you
and Rene Hernandez, ** he stabbed you?" Roger Arevalo gave the following
intriguing answer:  "Rene Hernandez
killed my father (Felipe Arevalo) and he was imprisoned," but that this
notwithstanding, he "did not harbor (any) ill feeling against ** Rene
Hernandez" because "I have my family."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court rejected Roger Arevalo's claim of self-defense,
and Edgar Blancaflor's defense of alibi.  It held their testimony unworthy of credit and ruled the prosecution's
proofs to have established beyond reasonable doubt that both said accused had
conspired to kill Reynaldo Hernandez and had carried out their objective with <i>alevosia</i>.  It thus rendered judgment in the manner
already described in the opening paragraph of this opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The review of the evidence painstakingly made by this Court
impels agreement with the conclusions reached by the Trial Court.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses
discloses that frankness, cohesiveness, and absence of dissemblance and
inconsistency which have come to be the recognized features of
truthfulness.  The eyewitnesses' account
of the killing of Reynaldo Hernandez is simple and direct:  while Reynaldo was sitting on a bench in the
sala of the house of Honorato Navarro, he was shot in the face by Roger
Arevalo; the same blast from the shotgun also injured Honorato; and as Reynaldo
was slumping to the floor, Edgar Blancaflor, who had climbed the window beside
which Reynaldo had been seated, stabbed him in the neck.  Said account is entirely consistent with the
medical expert's description of the wounds found on the victim's cadaver.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the accused-appellants is not, unfortunately, of
the same nature as that of the government witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Roger Arevalo's
testimony, generally to the effect that he had acted in legitimate defense of
his person, contains suspicious and debilitating elements.  His story is that, to protect himself from a
sudden, unprovoked attack of Reynaldo Hernandez -- as a result of which he had
in fact already sustained two (2) wounds in the back - ­he had stabbed the
latter in the neck.  Now, according to
Dr. Villasis, the post-mortem physician, the wound thus inflicted was a
grievous one, one which had penetrated the neck "through and through"
and severed a big artery, causing massive hermorrhage.  From such a wound, almost instantaneous
physical debilitation would have ensued, and death would have occurred in a
matter of moments.  This renders highly
suspect Edgar's claim that that neck wound notwithstanding, Reynaldo still had
sufficient life and vitality in him to wrestle with him for possession of the
shotgun, search for him while he (Edgar) sought to take cover by the side of
the house, and having spotted him, provide himself with a <i>bolo</i> and
prepare to hurl it ("spin it") at him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roger Arevalo's story also fails to explain why Honorato Navarro
was also injured by the same discharge from the shotgun.  And there are unusual circumstances
attending his contention that he had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">wounded
in </span>the back by Reynaldo Hernandez.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Roger testified that he was treated for stab wounds in the back
at the Mandaon Medicare Community Hospital, having in truth been confined there
for several days.  In relation to that
declaration, he marked in evidence a medical certificate purportedly signed by
the hospital's Chief, Dr. Napoleon M. Villasisto, which stated that he was
treated therein "from April 4, 1988 to April 11, 1988."  Obviously to substantiate this alleged
occurrence, the defense then caused a <i>subpoena</i> to be served on Dr.
Villasis, dated August 18, 1989, commanding his appearance on the 19th of
September, 1989 at 8:30 o'clock in the morning.  The caption of the <i>subpoena</i> of course, set out the full
names of both accused:  "ROGER
AREVALO and EDGAR BLANCAFLOR."  But
after receiving this subpoena, Dr. Napoleon Villasis declined to testify,
alleging that <i>he had no knowledge of the case</i>.  As much is shown by the handwritten return of the <i>subpoena</i>,
made by Pat. Rolly R. Ancao, INP, which reads:  <i>"Dr. Napoleon Villasis -- properly contacted but refuse to sign*
alleg*(ing) that he has no knowledge about this case"</i> There is no
question that Roger Arevalo and his counsel came to know of that return,
setting out Dr. Villasis' disavowal of any knowledge about the case of Roger
Arevalo; yet the latter made no further effort to procure Dr. Villasis'
appearance in court.  Hence, the record
reveals not only an absence of corroboration of Roger's contention that he had
been attacked by Rene Hernandez, but also a not insignificant indication of the
falsity of the medical certificate by which such corroboration was attempted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Roger Arevalo's assertion of having been confined at
the hospital is belied by Corporal Harry Estrella whose unrebutted testimony is
that Roger Arevalo surrendered to him the day after April 3, 1988 (or on <i>April
4, </i>1988) at the house of the latter's cousin in <i>sitio </i>Builan, Balud,
Masbate, to which house he had been brought by no less than Roger's wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">All things considered, it cannot but be concluded that the
defense has woefully failed to make out a case of self-defense in Roger
Arevalo's behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither will the defense of <i>alibi </i>serve to exculpate Edgar
Blancaflor from the crime of murder.  There is, for one thing, the undeniable fact that he was positively
identified by a witness who has not been shown to be other than credible, and
that, for another, his house is only a kilometer away from Honorato
Navarro's.  These are circumstances that,
as has been ruled countless times, effectively negate a proffered <i>alibi.  </i>And his cause is further enfeebled by
the evasiveness and inconsistencies disclosed by his testimony.  He first tried to disclaim any acquaintance
with Roger Arevalo, his own brother-in-law; he also denied knowing Honorato
Narvarro, admitting the contrary only after persistent cross-examination.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also agrees that the evidence sufficiently establishes
the existence of a conspiracy between the appellants, demonstrated among others
by "the concerted simultaneous attack they made on the victim," as
well as of the qualifying circumstance of treachery, in that the attack on
their victim was made in such a manner as to preclude any defense that the
latter might make.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court discerns no reason to disturb the findings of the
Regional Trial Court, no circumstance of weight to modify its verdict.  As has more than once been stressed,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
long-established and constantly reconfirmed is the guiding principle "that
unless arbitrary or without sufficient basis, the findings of trial courts on
questions of fact’ ** are accorded the highest respect on appeal, if not indeed
regarded as conclusive ** (People v. Francisco, 182 SCRA 305, 309; see also
People vs. Canamo, 138 SCRA 141; People vs. Cruz, 142 SCRA 576; People vs.
Monteverde, 142 SCRA 668; Vallarta vs. IAC, 151 SCRA 679; People vs. Laureta,
159 SCRA 256; and People vs. Javier, 183 SCRA 702).</p>

<blockquote>The rule is of special relevance and applicability where it is the
credibility of witnesses that is mainly in contention, and as to which a trial
court's findings will not be disturbed unless the record plainly shows that in
making them said court overlooked facts of substance or value which might, if
considered, yield a different conclusion.  The reason is that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">  (T)he appellate court goes
only by the sterile record.  By
contrast, the trial court can discern the nuances of tone or voice or flush or
blanch of face or dart of eyes or forthright gaze, that will draw the line
between fact and prevarication.  Enjoying
this advantage, the trial court is less likely than the reviewing court to
commit an error in assaying the conflicting evidence’ (People vs. Francisco, <i>supra)."<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the indemnity awarded by the Court <i>a quo</i> should
be increased from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00, conformably with present doctrine.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, modified by increasing the indemnity payable by
the appellants to the victim's heirs from P30,000.00 to P50,000.00, the
