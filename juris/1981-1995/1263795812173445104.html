frustrated homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Trial on the merits
thereon ensued after the petitioner pleaded not guilty upon being arraigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner invoked the justifying
circumstance of self-defense under Article 11 of the Revised Penal Code as his
main defense after it was indubitably proved that he stabbed the deceased and
the other offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, the petitioner elevated this case to the

self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the sake of
argument that the circumstances here as described by the witnesses for the

justification for taking the life of Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span>

wound which nearly caused <span class="SpellE">Cumarat’s</span> life for it is
clear from the evidence that the four men were unarmed (the claim that one of
them was carrying a club is hardly to be believed) and the accused himself
stated that the attackers were only using their fists on him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim that there were 'many people' may
be true in the sense that there were many passersby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But as far as persons attacking him were
concerned there were only four, for which reason <span class="GramE">We</span>
find it hardly justifiable for him to use his <span class="SpellE">breadknife</span>
against his attackers, a weapon which proved so lethal that only one thrust on
the victim was fatal enough.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In assuming for the sake of argument that the defense's version
of the facts is true and then ruling on the case only on the basis of the
second requisite of self-defense, the respondent Court paved the way for this
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner then saw the ripe opportunity to call for an
interpretation and a correct application of the second requisite of
self-defense.</p>

<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> and the streets were full of
pedestrians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At 1:00 in the early

one other were walking along the provincial road on their way home from a late

the Same direction were four men, the deceased Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span>,
his cousin Fernando <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> and one other, who too, were on their way home
after having drunk one bottle of beer each in a nearby restaurant when Federico
<span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> happened to bump <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>

(kissing) incident Federico and his companions walked ahead of the group of the
ac­cused, but upon reaching the inter­section of the road where they were about
to turn to go to their respect­ive houses, the accused suddenly caught up with
them, and without any word of warning stabbed first Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>
on the left side of his ab­domen, followed by another stab at Federico.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Federico's stab wound proved fatal, while
Rodolfo's, although likewise fatal, was attended to on time and fortunately
treated effectively, thus averting his death.</blockquote>

claim that after the 'first incident' they proceeded to walk ahead, with the
four men trailing behind them; and when they were about to reach the inter­section,
one of the four men who was later identified by the witnesses as Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> tried to catch up with Andres, and placing his hand
over Andres' shoulder, boxed Andres twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Andres tried to run away but all the four men chased him and started to
pummel him with fist blows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Andres

<p class="BODY">According to the respondent Court, the petitioner was not
justified in using his knife as against the bare fists of the unarmed group of
his alleged assailants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the
respondent Court made the observation that “the accused was a little too fast
and imprudent in the use of his <span class="SpellE">breadknife</span>, for there
really was no imminent danger to his life and limb when he wielded it against
the deceased and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, it held that the second requisite of self-defense was absent in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claimed otherwise, hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the petitioner originally pleaded
self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this kind of a defense,
the burden of proof rests upon the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His duty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">is </span>to establish self-defense by evidence clear and con­vincing,
relying on the strength of his own evidence not on the weakness of the
prosecution's.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The first requisite of self-defense is indis­pensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can be no self-defense until it is
proved that there has been unlawful aggression on the part of the person
injured or killed by the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If there is no unlawful aggression, there is nothing to prevent
or to repel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second requisite of
self-defense will have no basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
case of <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Yuman</u></span><u>,</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
this rule was explained as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it is
evident that our conclusion will have to be that her act of mortally wounding
her lover <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> Martin had not been preceded by
aggression on the part of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no occasion to speak here of the 'reasonable necessity of the
means employed to prevent or repel it', nor is it necessary to inquire whether
or not there was ‘sufficient provocation' on the part of the one invoking
legitimate self-defense because both circumstances presuppose unlawful
aggression which, we repeat, was not present in the instant case."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, the inescapable conclusion is that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issue </span>raised by the petitioner as to
the second requisite of self-defense is rather premature for he must first
establish the existence of unlawful aggression being perpetrated against his
person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, was there unlawful aggression on the part of the
petitioner's alleged assailants?</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that there was none.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial of the case, the prosecution and the defense
presented two conflicting versions of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each one contended that the opposing party
was the aggressor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial
court's findings of fact and assignment of values as to the evidence ad­duced
become relevant and decisive.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough perusal of the evidence on record, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>find the
trial court's findings and conclusions to be well in accord.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We thus agree with the following:</p>

<blockquote>"From the testimony of the pro­secution witnesses Fernando <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>, and
that of the witnesses for the defense it is clear that the incident that
happened in the early morning of <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="7">July
 26, 1972</st1:date> which resulted in the fatal stabbing of Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> and the almost fatal stabbing of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> by the ac­cused consisted of two stages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">first</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>stage</u> </span>was the “accidental

in front of the store of the Singer Sewing Machine along the provincial road of
<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused boxed Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> on the face but before the latter could retaliate,
Sally <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> intervened by pacifying Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> and holding his collar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> also held the accused and pulled him away; while the
companions of Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span> apologized for their
companion's conduct and also pulled away the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trouble was peacefully settled and
the two groups separated and continued walking along the road in the same
direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>second</u> <u>stage</u>

</span>The prosecution witnesses claim that when their group was at the
intersection near the <span class="SpellE">Kwik-Kway</span> En­gineering
building, the accused suddenly attacked them with his knife and stabbed Rodolfo
<span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> and then Federico <span class="SpellE">Bayya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense witnesses, however, testified
that it was the group of the four men that first attacked the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>
walked to the side of the accused, placed his arm on the shoulder of the
accused and then boxed him on the back of his head and on his throat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused then ran but he was chased by the
four men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they were able to
overtake the accused, they rained fist blows on all parts of his body and one
of them clubbed him on the shoulders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused crouched and tried to parry the blows with his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> told the accused to run but the latter could not run
because he was wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ac­cused
heard his attackers say that they were going to kill <span class="GramE">him,</span>
he remembered that he had his knife (bread <span class="SpellE">slicer</span>)
tucked in his waist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He pulled it,
closed his eyes and swung it in­discriminately against his attackers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he heard the whistle of a police­man and
his assailants ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The policeman
ran after his attackers and he also ran after the policeman to tell the latter
his attackers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not, however,
continue to run after the policeman and instead went to the house of his
sweetheart, <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not know if he was able to stab any of
his attackers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court is not impressed by the testimony of the accused on
this point and that of his sweetheart <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> because they are full of contradictions and
improbabili­ties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
ac­cused that he ran away <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">after </span>he
was boxed by Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> is contra­dictory to his
sworn statement, marked Exhibit "3", in which he stated that after <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> boxed him, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">he
</span>immediately stabbed the latter.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony at the
trial of <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> that
the accused ran away after he was boxed by <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> is
also contradictory to her sworn statement given by her to the police (Exhibit
"1") and also to her testimony at the preliminary investigation
(Exhibit "2") in which she stated that the accused did not run away.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
ac­cused at the trial that after he was overtaken by the four men, they boxed
him and clubbed him and that he crouched to evade the blows is contra­dicted by
his sworn statement, marked Exhibit "3", in which he stated that
after <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> boxed him, he immediately stabbed the
latter and when he saw that the companions of <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>
were surround­ing him he immediately attacked them by stabbing them
indiscriminately, without stating that these companion boxed him and clubbed
him.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony at the
trial of <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> that
it was <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span> who first boxed the accused and then
the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> companion also boxed and clubbed the
latter is contradicted by her sworn statements, Exhibit "1" and
Exhibit "2" in which she did not mention the boxing and clubbing of
the accused by the other companions of <span class="SpellE">Cumarat</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
ac­cused at the trial that the four men were armed is contradicted by his
aforementioned sworn statement, Exhibit "3", in which he did not
mention any club at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the men
had a club is also highly improbable and unbelievable because not one of them
was armed with a club when they first met the group of the accused in front of
the store of the Singer Sewing Machine and since the two groups walked together
up to the intersection, it can safely be presumed that the four men were also
unarmed when they reached the intersection since no evidence was presented to
show that somebody else handed a club to one of the four men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso</span> in her two sworn statements, Exhibit 'I’ and Exhibit
"2", stated that she did not notice any arm or weapon held by any of
the four men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These statements also
contradict <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Calso's</span>
testimony at the trial that one of the four men was armed with a club.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(6)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the
accused at the trial that he suffered contusions on his face and other parts of
his body is not only contradictory to his sworn statement, Exhibit
"3", but also belied by the following facts:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) he did not submit himself for medical
treatment; (b) he was able to report for work as usual at 4:00 o'clock that
same morning of July 26, 1972, only a few hours after the occurrence of the
fatal incident; (c) he went to the municipal building at about 6:00 o'clock
that same morning where he was investigated by the police, and nothing was
mentioned about his physical condition or appearance during the investigation,
which shows that the contusions that he claimed at the trial to have suffered
is not true; otherwise, the police investigator would not have failed to notice
said contusions, if any, and to ask him about it; (d) <span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calso</span>, in her aforementioned sworn statements did not
also mention the wounds suffered by the accused.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(7)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span>true as claimed by the accused that
the four men ganged up on him, boxed him and clubbed him, it would seem unbelievable
that the many people who were all around them on the road did not intervene to
stop it by holding the alleged combatants and calling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>policeman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An attack by
several men did not seem to be probable on the crowded road, but a sudden and
swift attack by a single person seemed possible.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(8)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim of
innocence at the trial by the accused is <span class="SpellE">negatived</span> by
the fact that he ran away after having stabbed his victims and went to throw
his knife away to another street and also by the fact that he did not surrender
to the police right away."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:11.0pt;color:black;vertical-align:baseline"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>
