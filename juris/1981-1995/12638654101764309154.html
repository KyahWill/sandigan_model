for the reason that in the case of eight (8) members of the UN Mission, their
recalls were allegedly made effective "some 16 to 23 months from receipt
of recall orders," this being "in consonance with Foreign Service
Circular No. 11-89" dated January 11, 1989 providing that "recall

"since notice of his recall order was received by him on 28 Dec. 1988 his

that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the period of his initial tour
of duty at the UN Mission at New York was not 13 years but 11 years and some 7
months, and he served in the home office for 14 months before being reassigned
to New York in June, 1984; (2) that these assignments involved no violation of
rules but had been "lawfully made by the then Minister of Foreign Affairs
in the exercise of his legal prerogative to redeploy DFA staff in (the)
interest of (the) service -- a prerogative of any secretary of foreign affairs,
past or incumbent **;" (3) that said prerogative was not being disputed,
the issue being his right to "one-year advance notice of recall
orders," a right unconditionally conferred by FS Circular 11-89; and (4)
that his request for one-year notice should thus be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 20, 1989, <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> having

<p class="BODY">On May 18, 1989, Secretary <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span>

<span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> case was substantially identical to those of
eight (8) other members of the Philippine Mission who had been accorded advance
notice of their recall of more than a year; and since only a question of law

<p class="BODY">On August 29, 1989, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs, through the
So<span style="">l</span>icitor General, instituted the
instant action of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition praying for invalidation of
the Trial Court's Orders of June 5, 1989 and July 25, 1989 because supposedly
"issued in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction." He submits that –</p>

<blockquote>1) respondent Court had no jurisdiction over the nature of the
action because:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 94.5pt; text-indent: -29.7pt;">a) <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> "recall to the Home Office was an exercise of
petitioner's prerogative and discretion which may not be interfered with by the
court;"</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 94.5pt; text-indent: -29.7pt;">b) "Circular
11-89, being a mere administrative issuance of petitioner, does not confer a
legal right on <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> upon which any action in a court
of law may be predicated;"</p>

<blockquote>2) <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> has no cause of action, not having exhausted his
administrative remedies; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> "has not shown that he will undergo ‘harsh
transition’ if recalled <span style="">to the </span>Home
Office."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> entire <span style="">case turns </span>about Circular 11-89.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the foundation for his claim that he is entitled to a one-year
period to wind up his affairs prior to transferring to a new assignment, and
that he was being discriminated against, considering that eight (8) other
members of the staff of the UN Mission had been accorded more than one year
advance notice of their recall or assignment to new posts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that when Circular 11-89 was promulgated <span style="">by </span>respondent <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span>
on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1989</st1:date>, all
the relevant events generating the controversy had already taken place, to <span style="">wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>
was ordered transferred to the Beijing Embassy; this, on <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1988</st1:date>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A month and a half
later, or on <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1988</st1:date>
he requested deferment of the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of his new
assignment for six (6) months to "give him ample time to wind up official
and pending family matters."</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The OPMS proposed (a) <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> recall to the Home Office and (b) revocation of his
assignment to <st1:city><st1:place>Beijing</st1:place></st1:city> because
Ambassador Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Severina</span>, under whom he would have
served, had questioned his (<span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span>) suitability and
expressed preference that in his stead, Ariel <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span>
of Seattle be assigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> was directed to stay on at <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state> in the expectation of his testifying before a
grand jury (pursuant to a PCGG request) the OPMS again proposed his recall to
the Home Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">5. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>As recommended, <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> recall to the Home Office was again directed,
advice thereof having been received by him on <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain conclusions are necessarily generated by these facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the period from
January 29, 1988 (date of the order for his transfer to Beijing) to December
28, 1988 (date of receipt by him of the reiterated order for his recall to
Manila), <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> could not but have known that whatever
be his new assignment -- Manila or Beijing -- he could no longer stay on at the
New York Mission; this, notwithstanding the interim order that he stay at New
York to give evidence before a grand jury, the stay thus directed being
obviously a temporary one, at best.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of December 28, 1988
-- when he received notice of the iterated order for his recall to Manila --
eleven (11) months had already elapsed since his transfer to Beijing was
ordered, and nine (9) months, since he requested for deferment of his tran<span style="">s</span>fer for <span style="">six </span>(6) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1988</st1:date>, he had no
"right" to one-year advance notice of any recall order, since that
was granted only on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1989</st1:date>,
when <span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span> issued Circular 11-89.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that he
knew all along that he could no longer count on staying indefinitely in New
York and that there was no alternative to his accepting his recall or
reassignment; considering that he had already had more than the six-month
extension <i><span style="">requested</span></i><span style=""> <i>by </i></span><i>him</i> on March 18, 1988
to "give him ample time to wind up official and pending family
matters;" and considering that he makes no pretense that he has not yet
been able, within that time, to "wind up official and pending family
matters," there appears to be no reason for him to refuse to comply with
the recall order received by him on December 28, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the only reason advanced by him for
seeking a one-year extension of stay in his New York post was simply and
exclusively because other foreign service officers or employees had been given
more than a year to wind up their affairs, and the grant of such an extension
to him would be in consonance with a subsequently promulgated circular (No.
11-89).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the request for
extension was unreasonable under the <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
facts of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given the foregoing
admitted facts, too, no "harsh transition" could possibly attend <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> recall from <st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>
to the Home Office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;
hence, there is no reason to apply Circular No. 11-89, which notes "that
recall orders are served one year in advance to cushion those concerned against
harsh transition." Given these same facts, the circumstance that other
officers and employees of the Foreign Service might have received more than one
year's advance notice of their recall orders, is utterly inconsequential.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The logical inference
from all these undeniable considerations is that <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>
simply wished to take advantage of Circular 11-89 for purely personal motives
and considerations, without regard to the interests of the service, or to set
at naught the orders of his superior because he did not agree with them, or just
to spite the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance
also exposes the paucity of his claim to equal treatment in relation to the
eight whose case he would cite as precedent.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, as of
date hereof, considerably more than a year has already elapsed since December
28, 1988 when he received notice of the last order for his recall to the Home
Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His insistence on one-year
advance notice of recall, counted from such a date, has clearly become moot and
academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would appear reason
enough to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> petition at this time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be this as it may, it may not be amiss also to look further into
the merits of <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question, indeed it is explicitly
admitted by <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> himself, that the Secretary of
Foreign Affairs has the authority under the law to recall and reassign officers
as the interests of the service may in his discretion require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 6,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Republic Act No. 708 as amended, provides as follows:</p>

the maximum period four years, except in case of emergency or extraordinary
circumstances, in which event he may be transferred from one foreign post to

length of service in his former post."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Where an officer has served in a foreign post for at least four
years, as in <span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> case, it would appear that the
Secretary's power of assignment and transfer rests entirely in his discretion,
guided chiefly by his perception of what is necessary for the good of the
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no need in that event
that some "emergency or extraordinary circumstances" exist, this
being required only where the officer has served less than four years in a
foreign post.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Abaya's</span> reassignment to Beijing in
January, 1988, and his recall to the Home Office reiterated <i>in December,
1988</i>, were thus well within the authority granted to the Foreign Affairs
Secretary by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those acts were based
on reasoned conclusions of the OPMS and the head of the Beijing Embassy -- <i>including
the fact that, as affirmatively appears on the record, <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>
is really an "overstaying" officer in the UN Mission, having served
in that post for much more than the maximum term of four (4) years prescribed
by Section 6 of the Foreign Service Law, as amended</i> -- and hence, could not
in truth be said to be in any sense capricious or whimsical, no matter how
debatable <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span> might think the validity of those
conclusions is.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question that now arises is whether or not Circular No. 11-89
subsequently issued by the Secretary himself,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
invalidated his prior acts, just described.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said circular reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Department regrets its inability to extend the tours of
duty of foreign service personnel for reasons of health, schooling of children,
or any reason other than the interest of the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Department is no longer in a position to
finance the school and medical fees of foreign service personnel or their
families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those ailing are suggested to
apply for sick leave, which they may spend abroad or in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as they are considered on home
assignment the day after their scheduled date of recall, their salaries shall
be computed at home office rates and payable in pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those with school children should be able to
provide them with housing, school and personal expenses until the academic year
ends or, they could send them back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in time for the opening of the school year in June.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It must be noted that recall orders are served one year in advance
to cushion those concerned against harsh transition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Extension of tours are a drain in the
country's foreign reserve; is unfair to foreign service personnel without
family; and destroys the raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span> of the
Department's rotation program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Please be guided accordingly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As will at once be noted, the Circular deals mainly with the matter
of extensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Circular does
essentially, is –</p>

<p class="BODY">1) to advise of the Department's inability to extend tours of
duty "for reasons * * other than the interest of the service," on
account of financial constraints, extensions being "a drain in the
country's foreign reserve, ** unfair to ** personnel without family, and **
(destructive of) the <i><span style="">raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>of
the Department's rotation program;" and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) to note -- when extensions are thus refused -- "that
recall orders," consistently with what appears to <span style="">be </span>theretofore prevailing practice, "are served one year in
advance to cushion those concerned against harsh transition."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Circular must of course be construed in relation to the power
of the Secretary of Foreign Affairs to promulgate administrative rules and
regulations, and his authority to transfer and reassign personnel for the good
of the service in accordance with Section 6 of the Foreign Service Act, as
amended, above cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this context,
and as framed, the Circular should be considered as primarily laying down a
policy against <span style="">extensions of foreign
assignments, and, <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span> -- extensions sought by
officers receiving orders of recall or reassignment being generally proscribed
-- drawing attention to the normal practice of giving one-year notice in
advance of such orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Circular
cannot be read as prohibiting recalls or reassignments without advance one-year
notice under any and all circumstances and conditions, and even when no
"harsh transition" is entailed by a recall or reassignment, or as
absolutely precluding amendment or modification thereof by the Secretary
himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No grave abuse of discretion, or lack or excess of authority, may
rightfully be ascribed to the respondent Secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is the Regional Trial Court which
the facts disclose to have gravely abused its discretion in having so utterly
misread the facts and the applicable law and overruling the Secretary's plainly
valid and legally authorized actuations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The writ prayed for will therefore issue, to nullify the challenged
orders of said Trial Court and -- to avert unnecessary proceedings, all the
facts necessary to adjudicate the issues raised by the parties having been laid
by them before this Court, and those issues having in fact been dealt with in
this opinion -- to direct that the action <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">be </span>aborted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Orders of respondent Court in Sp. Proc. No.
