concerned, but specifically denies the rest, the truth being that not all of

bank, but only four (4) and also that the original agreement of the parties as
to the payment of the said checks had already been <span class="SpellE">novated</span>

the Affidavit and Memorandum of Quitclaim dated February 26, 1974, had
been<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>signed and executed by the parties,
considering the fact that plaintiff agreed to the request of the defendant not
to deposit the said checks but wait for sometime to pay the said amount of
P40,000.00 in one lump sum, that as a matter of fact, defendant (sic) deposited
the said checks long, long after the supposed date of issuance of the same.</blockquote>

they were postdated and plaintiff knew for a fact they did not have sufficient
funds but plaintiff just the same accepted them subject to the conditions of
availability of funds by the plaintiff (<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sic).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In other words said checks were issued
only to guarantee the payment of the P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> but

deposit the said checks until after further notice from the defendant, as alleged
in paragraph 2 above.</blockquote>

that the outstanding balance due the plaintiff is P32,000.00 as alleged in
paragraph 2 hereof, but denies specifically that they are now ‘due and

that said agreement was already <span class="SpellE">novated</span> and voided as

so holds, that the aforementioned contract has never been altered, changed or <span class="SpellE">novated</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For what
the herein defendant actually did is not absolutely incompatible with the <span class="SpellE">prestation</span> of the existing contract but rather she
expressly ratified such obligation through the issuance of postdated checks,
some of which were cashed and others not for reason of insufficiency of funds
or ‘account closed.’”<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:

<p class="BODY">Besides, the private respondent's cause of action is based on the
"Affidavit and Memorandum of Quitclaim," the substance of which was
properly alleged in the complaint,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
copies thereof, were attached thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 8, Rule 8 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Rules
of Court provides that </span>when an action is founded </span>upon a written
instrument, copied in or attached to the corresponding pleading, the
genuineness and due execution of the instrument shall be deemed admitted unless
the adverse party, under oath, specifically denies them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the petitioner is deemed
to have admitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>genuineness
and due execution of the "Affidavit and Memorandum of Quitclaim" for
her failure to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">den</span>y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> the same </span>under oath; consequently,
the judgment on the pleadings rendered by respondent Judge was proper.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In her memorandum,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner further contends that the private respondent's reply should not have
been treated as a motion for a judgment on the pleadings for non-compliance
with the three-day notice rule and for lack of a notice of hearing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the petitioner's contention is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court
which states that where an answer "admits the material allegations of the
adverse party's pleading, the court may, on motion of that party direct
judgment on such pleading", does not state whether the motion for judgment
on the pleading may be considered <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
or only after notice of hearing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">served
on </span>the adverse party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion
for a judgment on the pleadings where the answer admits all the material
averments of the complaint, as in the present case, is one that may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">be </span>considered <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> because, upon the particular facts thus
presented and laid before the court, the plaintiff is entitled to the judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the purpose of the law in requiring the filing of motions, at least
three (3) days before the hearing thereof, is to avoid <span class="SpellE">suprises</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>opposite party <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>to give the latter time to study
and meet the arguments of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This purpose has been sufficiently compiled with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the petitioner having filed </span>an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">o</span>pp<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">osition to </span>the
said motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate the questioned judgment on the pleadings is a final
judgment:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>hence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">it </span>is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner therefore could have appealed from
the aforesaid judgment, but she did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having failed to appeal from the said judgment, she may not avail of the
writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <i>certiorari</i> </span>to
offset the adverse effect of her omission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>
