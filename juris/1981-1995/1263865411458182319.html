sentencing the accused to <span style="">life </span>imprisonment
for peddling marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 12, 1987, at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, Capt.
Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> of the 9<span style="">th </span>Narcotics Regional Unit (NRU), NARCOM, based in <span class="SpellE">Calarian</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City,
received information from a civilian informer that rampant selling of dried
marijuana leaves is being conducted in <span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive, <span class="SpellE">Baliwasan</span> Chico, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zamboanga</span></span><span style=""> </span>City,
by a <span style="">certain pusher who later was
identified as the herein accused, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span> Sanchez y <span class="SpellE">Pandili</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> relayed the information to his Commanding Officer,
Major <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Remetre</span>, who
authorized him to conduct a "buy-bust" operation against the
suspected pusher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Major <span class="SpellE">Remetre</span> gave Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> </span><st1:time minute="50" hour="14"><span style="">two (2) fifty</span></st1:time><span style=""> Peso (P50.00) bills to be used in the
"buy-bust" operation, which Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span>
marked by writing his initials under the Serial Numbers and at the back of the
P50.00 bills.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Thereupon Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> organized </span><span style="">a team of NARCOM agents</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">with him as Team Leader, com</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">osed of T-Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Genaro</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">Julom</span> and <span style="">CIC <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Dauz</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During <span style="">the
</span>briefing that he conducted before the o<span style="">p</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">ration, </span><span style="">Ca</span><span style="">p</span><span style="">t.</span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">S<span style="">abite</span></span></span>
designated CIC <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maximino</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span></span> to act
as the <span style="">"poseur-buyer" to buy
the </span><span style="">marijuana </span>from <span style="">suspected pusher </span>(accused), and for
this purpose the two (2) marked P50.00 bills <span style="">were </span>given to <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The team then "jum<span style="">p</span>ed
off" at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="15">3:45 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon, meaning, they left the NARCOM Headquarters for their target area
at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive</st1:address></st1:street>,
on board a tricycle and a motorcycle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Arriving at <span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive some thirty minutes
later, <span style="">C</span><span style="">1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> was </span>immediately directed to
proc<span style="">eed, </span>with the Civilian
Informer who was with them, to the place where the accused was conducting his
business of selling marijuana, while Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> and
T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Julom</span> stayed behind about 30 meters away where
they could not be noticed but where they could see and <span style="">observe </span>both C1C <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dauz</span></span><span style=""> </span>and
the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused and <span style="">a </span>companion
were under a house, and upon seeing them, the accused approached C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> and the informer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> then told the accused he wanted to
buy marijuana worth P100.00, and when the accused agreed to sell, <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> <span style="">g</span><span style="">ave </span>him the
two (2) Fifty Peso (P50.00) marked bills, and the accused left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5 minutes later, the accused returned
and handed C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> a rolled newspaper (Exhibit I-1)
which C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> inspected and when he found the
contents were dried marijuana leaves, he <span style="">immediately
</span><span style="">gave </span><span style="">the pre-agreed </span>signal to his
companions by placing his right hand on top of his head to signify that the
transaction was consummated, and thereupon Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span>
and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Julom</span> rushed to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused and his companions attempted to
flee but Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span> was able to collar <span style="">the </span>accused and placed him under
arrest, while his companion who was chased by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Julom</span>
was able to make good his escape by running to the interior of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span>
recovered from the right pocket of the accused only <st1:time minute="50" hour="13">one Fifty</st1:time> Peso bill, with Serial No. UH-427951 (Exhibit
H), which is one of the marked money, while the other Fifty Peso bill was not
recovered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused was then taken to the NARCOM Headquarters and turned
over to NARCOM Investigator Sgt. Mohammad <span class="SpellE">Sali</span> <span class="SpellE">Mihasun</span> for investigation, together with the confiscated
dried marijuana leaves which they estimated to be 20 grams in weight wrapped in
a newspaper (Exhibit I-1) and the recovered P50.00 marked money (Exhibit
H).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Mihasun</span>
prepared the booking sheet and arrest report (Exhibit C), the receipt of
property seized (Exhibit D), his Investigative Report (Exhibit J), a<span style="">nd </span>a letter addressed to the NBI
Regional Director requesting the <span style="">laboratory
</span>examination of the dried marijuana leaves (Exhibit E).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Isadore</span> Ma. Molina, the NBI Forensic
Chemist, upon receiving the specimen, weighed it at the laboratory and found
that the specimen submitted was 49.7 grams, not 20 grams as estimated by NARCOM
and indicated in the letter, and made the corresponding correction the letter
request by writing the figure "49.7 <span class="SpellE">gms</span>."
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then proceeded to conduct
the laboratory examination, using the three tests, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>microscopic, chemical and chromatographic
examination, the results of which show that the specimen was marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then prepared an official report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dangerous Drugs (Marihuana) Report No.
DDM-87-38 (Exhibit G), which contained the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"FINDING:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Weight of specimen - 49.7 <span class="SpellE">gms</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Microscopic, chemical and chromatographic examinations made

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused, however, tells a different story:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afterÂ­noon of <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1987</st1:date>,
he and his wife <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> Sanchez were walking home
along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Baliwasan</span> Chico, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
coming from a birthday party of his cousin Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Pandili</span>
who also live in <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Ates</span> Drive</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stopped walking for a while because his
wife told him to buy antibiotic capsules in the city proper, and gave him
P50.00, consisting of three P10.00 bills and one P20.00 <span style="">bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>While they were
still talking, a certain Joel <span class="SpellE">Hapner</span> approached them
and requested them to change into smaller denominaÂ­tions his two P50.00 bills,
and inasmuch as he had just the amount of change he changed one of the P50.00
bills, <span style="">while</span> they were changing
the money, a <span style="">motorcycle </span>with
three (3) persons riding (tandem), arrived and Joel ran away, at the same time throwing
towards them (the accused) the thing he was bringing in his hands which was
wrapped in a newspaper, which landed about 8 meters from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motorcycle stopped near them and two of
the riders alighted and chased Joel, while the 3rd rider who was left in the
motorcycle pointed his gun at him (the accused) and searched his body, without
saying anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the man removed
his (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>) belt which he used to tie his hands
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife, seeing the gun
pointed at him, was shocked, became pale and nearly fainted, and <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> Enriquez who happened to be nearby, went to her and
gave her water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two men (sic) chased
Joel returned without their quarry, but bringing the thing wrapped in the
newspaper which one of them picked up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The men took the P50.00 from his pocket, and asked him if he was
the companion of Joel, and when he denied, was slapped several times and boxed
on the stomach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The men, who turned out
to be NARCOM agents, then took him to the NARCOM headquarters on board a
passing private jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife, who was
not allowed by them to ride on the jeep, followed them to the headquarters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the NARCOM headquarters, he was investigated, and asked whether
he owned the newspaper, and when he denied ownership, he was again boxed like a
punching bag, because according to them was hard headed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not tell his wife that he was
maltreated and boxed inside the investigation room, but just cried because of <span style="">pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He
was detained, booked and the following day he was taken to the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused now assails the decision, insisting that the court a
quo erred in accepting the evidence for the prosecution and disregarding his
own.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in many criminal determinations, the question hangs often on
credibility of testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score,
we have consistently deferred to the findings of the trial judge, since he was
in a better position to observe the demeanor of the witnesses and to determine
the believability of their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As an appellate court, this Court has none of a judge's advantages but
only the cold records of the case, which themselves originated from his bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">The buy-bust operation conducted by police operatives herein
constitutes a legitimate effort by authorities to contain the perdition drug
abuse has brought upon man<span style="">y</span>,
especially the <span style="">youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>From the prosecution's version, the
accused was caught red-handed, in the <span style="">act
</span>of trafficking the prohibited plant in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hardly a strange story but on the other
hand, a perfectly credible one.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> assault on the
believability of the prosecution's evidence can not consequently prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His contention of discrepancies arising from
conflicting claims between investigators, who alleged that twenty grams of
marijuana were seized from his person, and the NARCOM chemist, who alleged that
49.7 grams were recovered, deserves no merit, because the fact remains that
there was marijuana seized, however no matter how much it weighed, and second,
because the authorities mistakes as to weights and measures can not reasonably
give rise to the inference, as he, the accused, would have us infer, that no
marijuana was recovered and that the <span style="">corpus
<span class="SpellE">delicti</span> </span>has been concocted by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was marijuana, although the authorities
differed as to how much it weighed, and it is to strain logic to say that
because of these differences, it means <span style="">that
</span>there was no marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the information indicated "marijuana dried
leaves"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
while the laboratory report mentioned "dried flowering tops"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
is no ground for acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
recently, we held:</p>

<blockquote>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>The alleged contradiction pointed out by the accused in the
testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Pfcs</span>. <span class="SpellE">Amor</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> regarding the description of the seized
marijuana is too trivial to warrant an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the tea <span style="">bags </span>contained marijuana leaves and
fruiting tops or simply marijuana stalks and seeds does not alter at all the
inescapable truth <span style="">that <span class="SpellE">Viloria</span> had been caught <span class="SpellE">redhanded</span>
in the act of peddling </span>illicit <span style="">drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the two peace officers could not be
faulted for making the wrong analysis of the marijuana because they are not
experts in that field.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The police's alleged inconsistencies with respect to previous
surveillance operations on the accused are likewise, immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sabite</span>
testified that the NARCOM made their move on the very day they
"busted" him (May 12, 1987) whereas C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span>
alleged that surveillance was conducted on the three days prior to his
apprehension is not, again, a basis for exoneration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="SpellE">NARCOM's</span>
alleged lapses can not dissipate the fact that marijuana was found in his
possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the prosecution managed to produce but one
fifty-peso bill in marked money is not fatal, and is explained by the fact that
the accused and his companion, Joel <span class="SpellE">Habner</span>, had split
the proceeds before C1C <span class="SpellE">Dauz</span> swooped down on the
former.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused can not say
logically that because the prosecution failed to produce in court one bill of
the two bills given to him, he is, <span style="">ergo,
innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The Court does not find
any connection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it <span style="">is </span>non-sequitur.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, he has failed to attribute improper motives to the
police, why the latter should falsify evidence at his expense, or why he should
be, as he claims, "set up."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court can not on the other hand, accept the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> version that he was merely walking on the street
when he was accosted by Joel <span class="SpellE">Habner</span>, who
"requested [him] to change into smaller denominations his two P50.00
bills,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and whereupon, NARCOM agents appeared, in order to effect the
apprehension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From his narration, <span class="SpellE">Habner</span> was a perfect stranger, and it is to contradict
human experience to say that they had met by chance, whereupon, the former
asked the latter to "break" a fifty-peso <span style="">bill, </span>and that he went to lengths to accommodate him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between his version and the prosecution's we
have no difficulty in making a choice.</p>
