				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner G. A. Machineries, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as
GAMI) seeks the reversal of the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
</span>the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, affirmed
by the Court of Appeals in the original case entitled <span class="SpellE"><u>Horacio</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, doing business under the name and style
"Hi-way Express", v. G. A. Machineries Inc.</u> for recovery of
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are not seriously disputed and
are summarized by the Court of Appeals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometime early in January, 1962 appellant GAMI, thru a duly
authorized agent, offered to sell a brand-new <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span>
Diesel Engine to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>, owner of the freight hauling business
styled 'Hi-Way Express'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relying on the
representations of appellant's representative that the engine offered for sale
was brand-new, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> agreed to purchase the same
at the price of P7<span class="GramE">,590.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the contract of sale thus entered
into, appellant delivered to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, on <st1:date year="1962" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1962</st1:date>, one (1) <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> Diesel Engine assembly, Model 6-D, with Engine
Serial No. A-212193, at 1500 RPM, with fly wheel, fly wheel housing, fuel
injection assembly, exhauster, fuel filter, oil filter, fuel lift pump, plus
conversion kit for F-500, subject to the standard warranties, particularly the
representation, relied upon by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, that the
same was brand-new.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said engine was
installed by appellant in Unit No. 6 of the Hi-Way Express.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Within the week after its delivery, however, the engine in
question started to have a series of malfunctions which necessitated successive
trips to appellant's repair shop.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it first sprang an oil leak such that, on <st1:date year="1962" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1962</st1:date>, it was brought in to '1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Adjust idling of engine and <span class="SpellE">tappete</span> clearance; 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Inspect and remedy oil leaks of engine; 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Replace clutch disc and pressure plate
w/original; and 4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Replace
release bearing hub <span class="SpellE">trunion</span> bolt' (Exhibit C).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the malfunctioning persisted and,
on ins­pection, <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mechanic noticed a worn
out screw which made <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> suspicious about the
age of the engine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prompted <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, thru his lawyer, to write appellant a letter,
dated <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1962</st1:date>,
protesting that the engine was not brand-new as represented (Exhibit E).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the recurring defects, the engine
was again submitted to appellant's shop to '1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Inspect engine oil leaks on cylinder head; 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Check up propeller shaft (vibrating at high
speed); and 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Tighten bolts of pump.' <span class="GramE">(Exhibit F).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
these notwithstanding, the engine could still not <span class="GramE">be</span>
returned into operation because it continued not to function well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was sent back to appellant's shop
on the same day it was delivered after the last repair work done on it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another check up was thereafter required to
be made on <st1:date year="1962" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1962</st1:date>
(Exhibit G).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">again, on </span><st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">March </span>10, 1962</st1:date>,
the engine was back at the repair shop to '<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inspect </span>leaks on No. 1
&amp; 5 high pressure pipe; and 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Change engine oil with flushing &amp; oil element' (Exhibit H).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, the oil leaks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">remained </span>unchecked and, on <st1:date year="1962" day="2" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">July </span>2, 1962</st1:date>, one last
effort to '1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Remedy engine oil leaks'
(Exhibit 1) was made, but all to no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">avail
because, instead of </span>improving, the engine's condition became worse as it
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">developed </span>engine knock and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> had to stop its operation altogether due <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>its <span class="SpellE">unserviceability</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These repeatedly recurring defects and continued failure of
appel­lant to put the engine in good operating condition only served to firm up
in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> mind the suspicion that the engine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">sold </span>to him was not brand-new as
represented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then sought the
assistance of the PC Criminal Investigation Service to check on the authenticity
of the serial number of the engine, with due notice to appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Scientific examination and verification tests
revealed that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">original </span>motor
number of the engine aforesaid was tampered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">inquiries </span>by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>Manila
Trading <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Company, </span>which also
handles the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">importation </span>and
distribution of similar engines, also disclosed that, unlike the engine
delivered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span><span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
whose engine body and injection pump were painted with two different colors,
brand-new engines are painted with only one color all over.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus convinced that a fraudulent misrepresentation as to the
character of the engine had been perpetrated upon him, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
made demands from appellant for indemnification for damages and eventually
instituted the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">present </span>suit.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">its </span>defense,
appellant interposed prescription of the action, denied the imputation of
misrepresenta­tion, and disputed the propriety and amount of damages
claimed." x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the trial court ruled in favor of
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the Court hereby
renders judgment ordering the defendant, G.A. Machineries Inc., to pay the
plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span>,
actual damages sustained in the sum of P54<span class="GramE">,000.48</span>; to
reimburse the purchase price of the <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel
engine in the amount of P7,590.00; and to pay attorney's fees to plaintiff's
counsel on the sum of P2,000.00 and costs.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiff is, likewise, ordered to return the <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel engine with serial number A-21219 to the
defendant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendant GAMI appealed the decision to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated earlier, the decision
was affirmed by the Appellate Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
motion for recon­sideration was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner GAMI raises the following alleged errors of judgment
of the respondent court:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The assignments of errors
raise the following issues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) whether
or not the respondent's cause of action against the petitioner had already pres­cribed
at the time the complaint was filed in the trial court; 2) whether or not the
factual findings of both the trial and appellate courts as regards the subject <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel engine are supported by evidence and 3)
whether or not the award of damages was justified considering evidence on
record.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The first issue is
premised on the petitioner's proposition that the respondent's cause of action
was for breach of warranty against hidden defects as pro­vided under Articles
1561 and 1566 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article
1571 of the Civil Code provides for a six-month </span>prescriptive period from
the delivery of the thing sold for the filing of an action for breach of
warranty<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> against hidden defects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">GAMI </span>when respondent <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay</span> filed the case with the trial court, more than
six months had already lapsed from the time the alleged defective engine was
delivered and, therefore, the action had prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that <span class="SpellE">Yaptinchay's</span>
asserted cause of action was premised and anchored on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the delivery by the defendant of a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">DEFECTIVE ENGINE </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">and that
the allegations in the complaint that the engine was not brand new are clearly
mere specifica­tions of the precise nature of the hidden defects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">A cursory reading of the
complaint shows that the petitioner's arguments are not well-taken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The main thrust of the
complaint is the conten­</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">tion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that the <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span>
diesel engine delivered by the </span>petitioner to the respondent was not
brand-new contrary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to the
representations of the former and the expectations of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was couched in a manner which
shows that instead of the brand-new <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel
engine which was bought by the respondent from the petitioner, another engine
which was not brand new was delivered resulting in the damages sought to be
recovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is evident <span class="GramE">therefore,</span> that the complaint was for a breach of a contract
of sale rather than a breach of warranty against hidden defects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because an action for breach of
warranty against hidden defects presupposes that the thing sold is the same
thing delivered but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">hidden defects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the six-month prescrip­tive
period under Article 1571 of the Civil Code is not applicable.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner takes
exception to the factual findings of the appellate court and argues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the </span>fact that the <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel engine developed oil<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> leaks does not necessarily imply that the said engine was not brand
new and 2) the testimony of laboratory </span>technician Captain Garcia of the
Philippine Constabulary to the effect that the motor or serial number of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">engine was tampered does not deserve
credence.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first argument is premised on the proposition that even
brand-new engines in many cases deve<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">lop
oil leaks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To support this proposition
the petitioner presented documentary evidence (Exhibits "5",
"7", "8", "9", "10", "11",
"12", "13", "14", "15", </span>"16",
and "17") consisting of job orders <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

new engines which developed oil leaks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">An examination of the
documentary evidence shows that the job orders were for twelve (12) different </span>engines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the petitioner's witness who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">testified on the said job orders admitted
that some engines were repaired only after </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">few months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the subject <span class="SpellE">Fordson</span> diesel engine was repaired on the complaint not
only of oil leaks but also replacement of clutch disc and pressure plate,
replacement of release bearing hub <span class="SpellE">trunion</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">belt, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the petitioner consisting of the job orders of the supposed brand-new engines
which </span>also developed oil leaks is no reason to doubt the trial court's
and appellate court's factual findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">fact, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the documentary
evidence and the admissions of the petitioner's witness enhance the

brand-new.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The second argument
questions Captain Garcia's findings that the original motor number of the
engine </span>was tampered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>shown

effect, the petitioner insists that the supposed fragmentary numerals could

been caused by sparks from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">welding

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The arguments are not
well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, the </span>statements
attributed to Captain Garcia are not accurate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An examination of the record shows that Captain Garcia positively stated
the fragmentary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">numeral to be a <u>numeral</u>
or a <u>number</u> but in the absence of key portions he could not positively
identify the exact number or numeral.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
discounted the possibility that such fragmentary numerals could be mere
scratches.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, the witness did not
categorically state that any molecular pressure could have caused the
fragmentary numeral.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Captain
Garcia under cross-examination stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>This
fragmentary numeral could be caused deliberately by tamper­ing with the engine
number or by other factor such as scratches or burning by other foreign
element, is that right?</blockquote>
