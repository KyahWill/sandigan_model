</span>Charged with violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act, he was tried and

Fernando was a suspected drug pusher who had earlier been placed under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">surveillance by the agents of the Narcotics

near a store while the agents posted themselves at strategic places in the
vicinity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Fernando arrived, he </span>gave
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Conde</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> two plastic wrappers containing dried
marijuana leaves, for which the latter paid two P5.00 bills previously marked

and confiscated the marked bills, in addition to three sticks of marijuana
leaves which were found in the right-hand pocket of his pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His confession was later taken after a
protracted investigation.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">These findings were based
mainly on the extrajudicial confession of Fernando and the testimonial evidence
of the prosecution witnesses, both of which the defendant-appellant now asks us
to reject.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In objecting to the
extrajudicial confession,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> Fernando claims it was obtained through

agents to force him to sign the confession but he did not inform his father
about it because he was afraid of further punishment from the agents.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> In fact, as the record shows, he did not
complain either to any one else afterwards, not even to the fiscal who
administered the oath when he subscribed his confession again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fernando did speak of his alleged maltreatment
during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, no witnesses
were presented to corroborate him; there was also no physical evidence of the
claimed injuries; and no medical certificate thereof was submitted to the
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Nevertheless, the
extrajudicial confession will still have to be disregarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is the obvious lack of compliance
with the indispensable requirements of the Bill of Rights for the protection of
the suspect under custodial investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have examined the said confession and find there was </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">mere </span><u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">effort to inform the defendant-appellant of
his rights under the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is manifest from the following exchange preceding the actual interrogation:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Preliminary:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Roger B. Fernando, you are hereby
informed that you are under investigation for commission of an offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under our New Constitution, you have the
right to remain silent and to counsel of your own choice and if you cannot
afford to retain a lawyer to assist you in this investigation, the Government
shall provide you one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is this clearly
understood?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After having appraised of your legal
right under the New Constitution, do you understand your right?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you wish to sign a waiver stating
among other that you wish to be investigated even without the presence of your
counsel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The above perfunctory and
almost mechanical "compliance" certainly did not follow the
prescribed procedure in the investigation of persons suspected of criminal
offenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rights guaranteed by the
Constitution were merely communicated but not explained to the suspect
notwithstanding the apparent need to do so, considering his circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere recitation of these rights is not enough
where it is not shown that the person entitled thereto can knowingly and
intelligently waive them, as we </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">held

the new Constitution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In <span class="SpellE">Galit</span>,
the Court declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At the time a person is arrested, it shall be the duty of the
arresting officer to inform him of the reason for the arrest and he must be
shown the warrant of arrest, if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
shall be informed of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel,
and that any statement he might make could be used against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The person arrested shall have the right to
communicate with his lawyer, a relative, or anyone he chooses by the most
expedient means - by telephone if possible - or by letter or messenger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall be the responsibility of the
arresting officer to see to it that this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is
accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No custodial investigation
</span>shall be conducted unless it be in the presence of counsel engaged by
the person arrested, by any person on his behalf, or appointed by the court
upon petition either <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the detainee
himself or by anyone on his behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
right to counsel may be waived but the waiver shall not be valid unless made
with the assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
statement obtained in violation of the procedure herein laid down, whether
exculpatory or <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>, in whole or in part,
shall be inadmissible in evidence."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is noteworthy that the
defendant-appellant was detained for all of five hours by the narcotics agents
before they extracted the two-page extrajudicial confession from him.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

minutes to reduce to writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During all
the time he was under investigation, there was no counsel to assist him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even his father, who was waiting in the
office where his son was being detained, was asked to go home before the actual
interrogation began.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> The defendant-appellant was all alone in the
office of his inquisitors when he finally signed the extrajudicial confession.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Echoing and even
improving upon <span class="SpellE">Galit</span>, Section 12 of the new Bill of
Rights, provides </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Any
person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the
right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent and independent
counsel preferably of his own choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be provided with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of
counsel."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any confession or admission obtained in
violation of this or Section 17 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">hereof
shall be inadmissible in evidence against him."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The requirements embodied in these rules are especially important
in cases like the one at bar, where the suspect from whom the <span class="SpellE">uncounseled</span> confession was taken was not yet in his
twenties at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nineteen is a
vulnerable age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A teenager is
practically putty in the hands of hardened investigators whose excess of zeal
in the discharge of their work may tempt them to take constitutional shortcuts
to secure a conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such excesses
will be futile now because the confession they may extract will not be
admissible in evidence against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exclusion of the extrajudicial confession will leave the
prosecution with hardly a leg to stand on, so to speak, for the rest of the
evidence is also unreliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
declarations of the prosecution witnesses are so confused and inconsistent, to
say the least, as to dictate disbelief and call for their rejection.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, first of all, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Conde</span>,
whose testimony understandably excited the amazement and anger of the trial
judge for its sheer incredibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
24-year old witness, employed as a janitor in the NARCOM office, was supposed
to double as an informer and was the person used <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

earlier, he said he could not do so because he did not know how to </span>read.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The
reaction of the trial judge speaks for itself:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
