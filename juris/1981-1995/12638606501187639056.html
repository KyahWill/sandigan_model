<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, the accused appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 16, 1983, a group of sixteen fishermen working in a
fishing venture locally known as "<span class="SpellE">likum-likum</span>"
or "<span class="SpellE">pangulong</span>" owned by one Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> of <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Astorga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Daram</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, went to rest and spend the night in So.
<span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Bachao</span> of the same municipality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although Felipe <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>
himself was not there, his son Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> was
with the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the group, Rogelio
<span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintas</span> and Esteban <span class="SpellE">Labian</span> spent
the night in the group's motorboat which had earlier been hauled up on the
beach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the fishermen were either
in the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> where the nets where kept ("<span class="SpellE">ligkupan</span>") or in the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The others were in the house of <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Councilman <span class="SpellE">Hernani</span> <span class="SpellE">Salubaga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 p.m.</st1:time>,
Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quintas</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Labian</span> went to sleep in the motorboat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> stayed on
the cover directly above the engine; <span class="SpellE">Quintas</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>little bit astern, and <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>, a little to the front of <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>
at the middle of the motorboat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about
<st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 p.m.</st1:time>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> was awakened by two persons, one of whom was trying
to get something from his pocket while the other was pointing a small bolo
("<span class="SpellE">sipul</span>") at him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They took <span class="SpellE">Gososo's</span>
Seiko 5 wrist watch worth P800.00 and his money in the amount of P2,200.00
which he kept inside his pocket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, two other persons were near Esteban <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of those two persons was accused Alberto
Padilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Labian</span>,
a 16 year old boy who had just awakened, tried to jump off the motorboat but
was held back by one of the two men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When he was about to shout, Alberto Padilla stabbed <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>
with a "<span class="SpellE">sipul</span>" (a small bolo) about a foot
long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Esteban <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>
had been stabbed, the four persons ran away and took with them the money and
the wrist watch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> accompanied by some men went by motorboat to <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Brgy</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span><span class="SpellE">Calawan</span>-an
to inform the authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They reported
the incident to Policeman <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> "<span class="SpellE">Siyong</span>" <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> who at that
time, happened to be in <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cansaganay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span>,
together with three members of the Civilian Home Defense Force (CHDF), Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> and the latter's companions went to <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> at around 1:00 a.m. of May 17, 1983 but did not
find the suspects who were identified by Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>
as Boyce <span class="SpellE">Jamindang</span>, a certain "<span class="SpellE">Moloc</span>", Alberto Padilla who stabbed <span class="SpellE">Labian</span> and Toto <span class="SpellE">Mendido</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed that the suspects were
from the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> proper of <span class="SpellE">Bachao</span>,
Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> and company proceeded to the said
place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2:00 a.m.</st1:time> they found Padilla lying on his back asleep with
a bloodstained bolo in his right hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They noted that Padilla's right hand and the right side of his shirt and
long pants were stained with blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">After one of the CHDF members removed the bloodstained bolo from
Padilla's hand, Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> awakened Padilla and
told the latter to sit down. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span><span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> asked
if he were responsible for the death of Esteban <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Padilla did not answer but merely stared at
the policeman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> asked the accused about the bloodstains and other matters
but the latter only stared at him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the group brought Padilla to <span class="SpellE">Daram</span>
via <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> in a motorboat and turned him over to
Cpl. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Costo</span> and Pfc. Castillo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy conducted on the victim yield the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PHYSICAL
EXAMINATION FINDINGS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presence of stab wound 3 cm. at level of
left nipple (sic) 6 cm. long penetrating the thoracic cavity <span class="SpellE">ferforating</span> (sic) the heart.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused, on the other hand, denied having killed the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that on that day, he
went on a picnic with some <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span> at the bend of
the shoreline around a kilometer from <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Bachao</span>; that he participated in the tuba drinking session
and got drunk; that at 6:00 p.m., he went home to take supper; that at about
the same time, he saw Toto <span class="SpellE">Mendido</span>, Boyce <span class="SpellE">Jamindang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Moloc</span> on their way
to a public dance in So. <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span> which is two
kilometers away from <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Bachao</span>;
that after his supper at about 8:00 p.m., the accused went to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> "tennis court" to watch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">over </span>the motorboat <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>Jaime <span class="SpellE">Jamindang</span>
as he was the engineman <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>said
boat; that he fell asleep near the bench at the tennis court; that he did not
carry a bolo with him; that he recognized the bloodstained bolo to be that
owned by Toto <span class="SpellE">Mendido</span> as it was the same weapon used
by the latter in mending the fish nets of his uncle; that his lack of response
upon being awakened to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">queries </span>posed
by Policeman <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> was due to shock as three rifles
were pointed at him; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">that </span>in the
motorboat where he was brought by <span class="SpellE">Gulane's</span> group, the
accused denied the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">charge </span>against
him whereupon the CHDF struck him with the muzzle of their guns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defense witnesses, Rodrigo <span class="SpellE">Labian</span>, the
father of the victim and <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Captain of <span class="SpellE">Bachao</span>,
testified that the killer was Toto <span class="SpellE">Mendido</span> and that
they came to know the real assailant from information given by Policemen <span class="SpellE">Gulane</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dianing</span>, relatives,
rumors emanating from the place which all pointed to <span class="SpellE">Mendido</span>
as the killer and from one of the suspects, <span class="SpellE">Moloc</span>,
respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court rejected the alibi of the accused as weak and the
testimonies of his defense witnesses as inadmissible as part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>g</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">estae</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>and for being hearsay.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
<span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> testimony, to Our mind, engenders nagging
doubts rather than certainty, of the appellant's identity as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>It must be noted that except for the distant light of the stars, the
place where <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> and company slept was dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

of <span class="SpellE">Gososo's</span> outfit which could have indicated whether
or not the same reflected light.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
situation, human experience attests that the beam of a flashlight focused at a
non-reflective object like parts of a person's body does not bounce back to
illuminate the face of the flashlight holder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, the starlight could not have been much of an aid to <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span> considering that he was then under the canvas

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Since there were two
eyewitnesses to the crime, We find it peculiar that the other eyewitness, <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, was not used by
the prosecution to support the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Gososo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On their part, the robbers, as they are wont
to do, would take pains to avoid recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, they sought the cover of darkness to assure success of their
evil design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances,
there </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">are </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">serious misgivings as to </span>the

testimony has failed to pass the test of <span class="SpellE">positiveness</span>
and reliability necessary for conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In case of reasonable doubt, the same must be construed in favor of the
accused who is presumed innocent under the law until otherwise proven.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant interposed an
alibi on that fateful </span>night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that he attended a picnic and joined a group drinking tuba; that after
he got drunk, he went to eat <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">his </span>supper;
and that thereafter, he went to the tennis court to watch the boat of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Jamindang</span> and in the process, fell asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He disclaimed participation in the crime and
ownership of the bloodstained bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alibi is generally considered a weak defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it assumes importance where evidence
for the prosecution is weak and betrays concreteness on question of whether or
not the accused committed the crime charged (People v. <span class="SpellE">Delmendo</span>,
L-32146, November 23, 1981; 109 SCRA 350).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have also ruled that although alibi is easily fabricated, it is not
always false and without merit and when coupled with the improbabilities and
uncertainties of the prosecution evidence, the defense of alibi deserves merit
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Castelo</span>, L-48070, December 26, 1984; 133
