declared as null and void the public auction sale in 1941 conducted by the City
Treasurer of Manila of the two subject parcels of land as well as the
subsequent sales of the same to Juanita David and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>,
successively (in 1943 and 1944), and ordered the latter to execute a deed of

<p class="BODY">The following facts are not in dispute:</p>

<p class="BODY">In his lifetime, <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz was the
registered owner of two parcels of land in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
with a total area of 541.27 square meters covered by Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 23783 of the Re­gister of Deeds of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both lots were declared for taxation pur­poses
under one tax declaration with an assessed value of P1, 516.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz died on <st1:date year="1931" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1931</st1:date>, and his wife, Amanda <span class="SpellE">Trigal</span>, died on <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="1">January
 11, 1957</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surviving them are
their children and grandchildren who are the private respondents in this
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the death of the couple,
Manuel Paz administered the property and paid the taxes thereon such that all
communications concerning the same were supposed to be addressed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed, however, that neither he nor
his co-heirs ever received any notice of sale of the property or notice to
surrender the owner's duplicate certificate cover­ing it, but this was not
established to the trial court's satisfaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1941" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1941</st1:date>,
the City Treasurer of Manila sold the said property in favor of Dr. Aurelio
Reyes for delinquent taxes from 1939 to 1941.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the lapse of one year, or on <st1:date year="1943" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1943</st1:date>, during the Japanese occupation of the
country, to be exact, the said City Treasurer executed a final deed of sale
thereof for P93.43 in favor of the said Dr. Aurelio Reyes as the
purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon petition of the latter
which was ordered published in a newspaper of general circulation once a week
for three consecutive weeks<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and thereafter there being no opposition filed, the land registration court
issued an or­der <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the owner's certificate
of title in the name of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz, the registration
of the final deed of sale, and the issuance of a new certificate of title in
his (Reyes) favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1943" day="3" month="9">September
 3, 1943</st1:date>, the said purchaser, Dr. Aurelio Reyes, sold the said lots
for P4, 250.00 to Juanita David for which Transfer Certificate of Title No.
67979 was issued in her name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still
later, or on <st1:date year="1944" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1944</st1:date>,
Juanita David sold the same lots to Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>
for the amount of P15,000.00 for which Transfer Certificate of Title No. 72862
was issued in his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> even­tually sold a small portion of the lot to the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> for the widen­ing of
a street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 72862 <span style="">was
cancelled and replaced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 43845.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 21, 1948, Amanda <span class="SpellE">Trigal</span> and
her co-heirs to the deceased owner <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz filed
suit against the estate of Aurelio Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>
and the city treasurer (to the exclusion of Juanita David) with the Court of
First Instance of Manila to annul the public auction sale of the lots in
question in favor of Dr. Reyes and all sub­sequent transfers thereof, the last
being in favor of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>, on the ground
that the public auction sale conducted by the Chief of the Department of
Finance and City Treasurer of Manila was done without notice to <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz, the registered owner of the said property, or
to any of his heirs upon his death.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After hearing, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> dismissed the complaint, support­ing its conclusion, to wit -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although there is no evidence showing that the notice of said
sale was published in newspapers of general circulation in the City of Manila
or the posting thereof in conspicuous places of the said city and in the City
Hall, because all the records were either lost or destroyed during the battle
for the liberation <span style="">of the City of
Manila, yet there appears in the final deed of sale, exhibit J executed by the
Manila City Treasurer, the following statement -</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'AND WHEREAS, the City Treasurer of Manila did, upon warrant of a
certified copy of the record of such delinquency, advertise for sale said real estate,
or so much thereof, as might be necessary to satisfy all public taxes upon real
estate, penalties, and costs of sale, for a period of thirty days prior to the
date of sale by keeping a notice posted at the main entrance of the City Hall
and other conspicuous places in the City of Manila, and by publication for said
notice of said sale once a week for three weeks in the 'HERALD', 'EL DEBATE'
and 'MABUHAY' newspapers of wide circulation in the City of Manila,
Philippines.'</p>

<blockquote>"The above statement made in a public document by a public
officer cannot be considered as whimsical or capricious for the purpose of
deceiving or prejudic­ing any person or persons such as the plaintiffs in the
instant case; rather it contains all the facts that trans­pired when the
parcels of land in question were sold at a public auction on November 24,
1941.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated in other words, the
regularity of an official act is presumed, there being no evidence to the
contrary.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"In a sale to satisfy
delinquent taxes, it is </span>not necessary that the delinquent taxpayer or
any one holding or owning delinquent property be personally notified of the
sale; it is sufficient that the notice of sale be advertised by publishing the
same in a newspaper and by posting the same in conspicuous places of Manila and
in the City Hall of said city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
requirement has been accomplished.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We notice, on the other hand, that Juanita David, who bought
the same properties from Aurelio Reyes, was not included in the action, so that
if a <span style="">decision be rendered in favor of
the plaintiffs, grant­ing the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for in
their amended complaint, the said Juanita David would be deprived of her
property without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, Juanita David and Mariano V. <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>,
being purchasers in good faith and for value, their title to the disputed </span>properties
could not be disturbed any longer."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal of the decision to the Court of Appeals, the said
court reversed the same by declaring null and void the sale of the pro<span style="">perty to Dr. Reyes as well as the subsequent
sales to Juanita David and Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent appellate court further ordered <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> as the present registered owner to execute a deed
of convey­ance of the said property in question in favor of herein private
respon­dents. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All these for the reason
that the City Treasurer of Manila lacked the authority to sell the property on
the authority of <span class="SpellE"><u>Velayo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span>,</u> as already stated in the first paragraph
hereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner, in
seeking a review of the decision, assigns the following errors of the Court of
Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in holding that because the sale by the City
Treasurer to the Vendee Aurelio Reyes at public auction was null and void the
subsequent sales by Aurelio Reyes to Juanita David and by Juanita Da­vid to Mariano
<span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> were similarly void;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>in not
holding that the title of Ma</span>riano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>, an
innocent purchaser for value, is indefeasible even if the sale by the City
Treasurer to Aurelio Reyes was null and void."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption is that Mariano <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>
(now deceased), the predecessor-in-interest of herein petitioners, his heirs,
and in whose name the land in question is now titled under the Torrens system
was not aware of any defect in the title when he purchased the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No allegation to the contrary was made in the
complaint below; much less was evidence submitted to that effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">it
</span>is conclusive that <span class="SpellE">Ta­jonera</span> derived his title
<u>clear of any encumbrances and recorded rights of third parties,</u> from
Juanita David, who in turn had bought it from Au­relio Reyes, the direct
purchaser of the property in the tax delinquency sale way back in 1941 from the
City Treasurer of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the power to sell at public auction real estate
delin­quent in the payment of taxes devolved upon the City Assessor and not
upon the Treasurer of the City of Manila according to the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Ve­layo</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span>,
et al</u>., 102 Phil. 395, may no longer be invoked to <span style="">recover </span>the property from petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To grant the relief prayed for -that is the
annulment of the sale and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the
property to respondents - would be to impair public confidence in the
certificate of title, for everyone dealing with property would have to inquire
in every instance as to whether the title has been regularly or irregularly
issued by the court and this is contrary to the <span style="">evident purpose </span>of the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
This is particularly true where the treasurer's deed of sale was accord­ed full
credit and validity by the land registration court and the Register of Deeds
who on the strength thereof ordered the cancellation of the title in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> Paz and the issuance of a new Torrens Title
in the name of Reyes as the buyer at the tax sale and in the names of the <span style="">subsequent buyers of the property in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Whether the said ruling of <span class="SpellE"><u>Velayo</u></span> may be considered to be still in force,
considering that all </span><span style="">such tax </span><span style="">sales of delinquent real estate have
generally now been effected by the city treasurer, as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Paguio</u></span><u>
vs. Ruiz</u>, cited <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>, is an open question,
which however is not necessary to discuss or resolve now in the light of the <u>ratio
<span class="SpellE">decidendi</span></u> of this case upholding the rights of
intervening purchasers in good faith, aside from its not having been put in
issue.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 39 of the Land Registration Act, as amended, is explicit
that "every person receiving a certificate of title in pursuance of a
decree of registration, <u>and every </u><u><span style="">subsequent purchaser </span>of registered land who takes certificate of
title for value in good faith shall hold the same free of all encumbrance
except those noted on said certificate</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held:</p>

<blockquote>"Every person dealing with registered land may safely rely on
the correctness of the certificate of title issue <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
and the law will in no way oblige him <span style="">to
go behind the certificate to determine the condition of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">property."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, in order that a purchaser may be
considered a purchaser in good faith, it is enough that he examine the latest
certificate of title.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In line with this principle, all that <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>
had to do was to exa­mine his transferor's title which was then in the name of
Juanita David.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not have to go
behind this title and scrutinize each and every title that preceded it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not being required under the law to check on the validity of the
sale to the original buyer and being without knowledge of any defect in the
title appearing on its face, <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span> falls under the
definition of a purchaser in good faith and entitled to protection under the
Land Regis­tration Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that the private respondents came to know of
the sale at public auction of the properties in question in the year 1943;<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
yet, they were first heard to complain about it only on December 21, 1948<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
(five years after they had admittedly learned of the tax sale and seven years
after the actual sale) when the property had already reached the hands of
innocent purchasers like Juanita David (<span class="SpellE">Tajonera's</span>
predecessor-in-interest) and her vendee, <span class="SpellE">Tajonera</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is on this score that the cited case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Velayo</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span>,</u> <u>et al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
cited by the Court of Appeals, differs from, and loses its applicability to,
the case at bar insofar as it would cancel petitioners' title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said case, the annulment of the auction
sale conducted by the City Treasurer of Manila and the confirmation of the rights
of the ori­ginal registered owner therein came at a time when the property sold
at public auction for tax delinquency had not yet passed to the hands of an
innocent purchaser for value, unlike in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">While respondents' plight may merit some sympathy at the pain of
losing their property for tax delinquency, it must be borne in mind that it was
due primarily to their neglect and default in paying their just tax obligation
and sleeping on their rights and long delay of five years before filing their
action for recovery during which the rights of innocent purchasers for value
intervened.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the late Justice Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
stressed for the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Paguio</u></span><u> vs. Ruiz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
in upholding the city treasurer's 1947 tax sale of the delinquent property
(although the treasurer's notices of sale which were sent to the registered
owner who was already deceased and at her recorded address in <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span> where her home had been destroyed during the war
were admittedly undelivered and returned to the treasurer), "(M)<span class="SpellE">uch</span> as we may sympathize with the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
this is one case where the courts have no option but to apply the law and give
the petitioner the remedy she seeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
law is positive and leaves us no choice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is harsh and drastic, but it is a necessary means of insuring the
prompt collection of taxes so essential to the life of the Government.</p>

<blockquote>"Yet it was her gross negligence which brought about the <span class="SpellE">appel­lee's</span> predicament.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Knowing her property to be subject to tax, she neglected to pay her
obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vigorous in her protest that
she was not given opportunity to protect her rights, she at least neglected to
put the Government in a position to allow her that opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this, notwithstanding the categorical mandate
of section 2482 of the Revised Administrative Code, which she was presumed to
know, and which makes it the duty of each person' acquiring real estate in the
city to make a new declaration thereof, with the advertence that failure to do
so shall make the assessment in the name of the previous owner 'va­lid and
binding on all persons interested, and for all purposes, as though the same had
been assessed in the name of its actual owner.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision under review is re­versed and
the complaint is hereby dismissed, without costs.</p>
