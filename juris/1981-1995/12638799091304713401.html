				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision as well as the
resolution of the Court of Appeals which affirmed the order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1989</st1:date> of the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch 88 in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-89­-2357 convicting petitioners Julia L. Tan and James L. Tan of
indirect contempt and sentencing each of them to suffer a penalty of
imprisonment of ten (10) days and to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">pay
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a fine </span>of P500.00 each.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Julia L. Tan is an 84 year old widow who <span class="GramE">is the Principal of Grace Christian High School</span> offering
both elementary and secondary courses while petitioner James <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">L. </span>Tan is the Administrative Consultant
of the school.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case arose from the refusal of the petitioners to admit and
enroll certain students for the school year 1987-1988 because heated
controversies, acts of misbehavior, and a refusal to dialogue with the school
administration led the school authorities to believe that it would be best for
all concerned if these children enrolled in other schools.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two separate petitions for <i>mandamus</i> with prayers for
preliminary mandatory injunction were eventually filed with the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first case docketed as Civil Case No. Q-51039 was assigned to Branch
79 of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The second case which
led to the present petition was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-89-2357 and was
assigned to Branch 88.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter case
was filed by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> and his daughter <span class="SpellE">Vonette</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">Luy</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">, who </span>were
also petitioners in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-51039.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1987</st1:date>,
Branch 79 in Civil <span class="GramE">Case</span> No. Q-­51039 issued an order
granting the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The school and the petitioners were ordered
to allow enrollment of the subject children.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the two cases were pending in court, the children were
enrolled and continued their studies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>During the enrollment period in May, 1989, however, the petitioners
refused the enrollment in the first year <st1:place><st1:placetype>high school</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Carmelea</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
  See</st1:placename></st1:place>, Michael Robert <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>,
Karen Gay <span class="SpellE">Dipasupil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Vonette</span>
<span class="SpellE">Luy</span> on the ground that the school was under no legal
duty to still accept them in the high school after graduating them from the
elementary course.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1989</st1:date>,
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> (father of <span class="SpellE">Vonette</span>
<span class="SpellE">Luy</span>) together with other parents Josefina <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>
See and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Dipasupil</span>
filed in Branch 79, a motion to hold in indirect contempt the petitioners for
refusing to enroll their children in alleged disobedience of the writ of
preliminary injunction issued on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="7">July
 1, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1989</st1:date>,
Branch 88 issued an order in the second case granting the prayer for the
issuance of the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction and ordering the
petitioners to enroll <span class="SpellE">Vonette</span> <span class="SpellE">Luy</span>
in the first year high school.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the herein petitioners challenged in the Court
of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 13179) the order granting the writ of a preliminary
mandatory injunction by Branch 79.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals set aside the order prompting the respondents to file a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case was docketed as G.R. No. 90063.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated December 12, 1989, we dismissed the
petition for lack of merit and resolved "that x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> the children here affected shall be allowed to
finish the current school year (including the summer term if any), as the
questioned order of the Court of Appeals shall take effect only as of the
beginning of school year 1990-1991."</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the case in Branch 88 continued its independent
course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1989</st1:date>, the trial court upon motion of
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> issued the questioned order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This order is now challenged by the
petitioners in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the controversy which led to the two cases against
the petitioners are stated in this Court's Resolution in G.R. No. 90063,
"Yap Chin <span class="SpellE">Fah</span>, et al. v. Court of Appeals, et
al.", <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1989</st1:date>,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometime in 1986, private respondent <st1:place><st1:placename>Grace</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Christian</st1:placename> <st1:placename>High School</st1:placename></st1:place>
('Grace Christian') applied with the then Ministry of Education, Culture and
Sports (MECS) for a tuition-fee increase of fifteen percent (15%) for the
School Year (SY) 1986-87.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent Grace Christian had applied for, and been granted, yearly increments
in tuition fees from SY 1973-74 (except for SY 1983-84) until SY
1985-1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="12">18 December 1986</st1:date>, Grace Christian received a
notice from the MECS that its fee-increase application had been definitively
approved on <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="11">10 November 1986</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, a group of parents whose children are enrolled in Grace
Christian, allegedly alarmed by what they perceived to be deterioration --
despite the periodic fee <span class="GramE">increases<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>--</span> in academic standards and physical
facilities of the school, formed the Grace Christian High School
Parents-Teachers Association ('Association').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Association, composed of a majority of the parents (despite its
name, no faculty member sits on the executive committee) demanded:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) recognition as an organization; and (b)
representation in Grace Christian's policy-making process, viz., faculty
selection and improvement of the physical plant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling that their demands had been largely
ignored, the Association in October 1985 asked for a formal dialogue with the
school administration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During a heated
exchange in this dialogue, one of the petitioners herein, William <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span>, stood up and pointed a finger and shouted at Grace
Christian's vice-principal, and later spat on the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="9">23 September 1986</st1:date>,
Grace Christian had been granted provisional authority by the MECS to impose a
fifteen percent (15%) increase in tuition fee for SY 1986-1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, some of the above-mentioned group
of parents lobbied with the other parents urging non­-payment of the fee
increase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the enrollment period for
the second semester of SY 1986-1987, a number of parents, among them
petitioners (comprising nine [9] members or officers of the 19-member executive
committee, of the Association) refused to pay the incremental fee:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Grace Christian in turn refused to receive
these parents' payment of regular (i.e., the fee before the fifteen [15%]
increase) tuition fee for that semester.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="12">16 December 1986</st1:date>,
Grace Christian reminded the parents about the payment of the approved
increased tuition fee for the second semester.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From 23 February to <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="3">5 March
 1987</st1:date>, a group of parents, petitioners included, staged a rally
outside the school gates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Banners and
placards critical of the school administration were set up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latent animosity between the Association
(<span class="GramE">or</span> some members thereof) and Grace Christian began to
flare up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners first came out
with statements in the print and broadcast media attacking Grace Christian's
periodic fee increases and allegedly deteriorating academic standards.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the petitioners, armed with <span class="SpellE">videocameras</span>, forced their way into the school premises and
interrupted a class in session, urging students therein to speak -- using the
allotted class hour -- against school policies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of the students walked out of their classrooms to join their
parents in the rally outside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="2">27 February 1987</st1:date>,
the Association through a letter asked Secretary <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>
of the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) to reconsider the <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="9">23 September 1986</st1:date> (as well as the <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="11">10 November 1986</st1:date>) order granting the
school's application for a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">fee </span>increase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On 12 March 1987, the Association obtained a
'freeze-order' from the DECS, enjoining Grace Christian from imposing the
already approved fifteen percent (15%) fee increase, until the DECS shall have
received proof that sixty percent (60%) of the increase had been apportioned to
salaries of Grace Christian's faculty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After submission by Grace Christian of proof of payment of salary
increases to the faculty, the DECS in an <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="3">16 March 1987</st1:date> lifted
the ‘freeze-order,' thereby allowing the school to resume collection of the
fifteen percent (15%) fee increase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, the already adversarial relationship between Grace
Christian and the Association further deteriorated when the school
administrators overheard several of the Prep (preschool) students chanting
slogans against the school and its teachers, indicating that their parents had
imbued them with hostility or at least disdain and scorn for the school.</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the period 14-18 April 1987, petitioners were individually
and personally informed through a letter by the principal of Grace Christian
that, as they were severely critical of the school's policies, it would be best
for all concerned if their children enrolled in some other school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="5">25
 May 1987</st1:date>, the first day of the enrollment period for SY 1987-88,
petitioners were informed that as their respective children were in the list of
'referral' <span class="GramE">cases,</span> the school <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">principal </span>would confer with them either in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="5">29 May 1987</st1:date>, the last day of
enrollment, or on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="5">30 May 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners felt that their children were
being singled out by the school and decided not to see the principal and
instead proceeded to the DECS for <span class="GramE">advise</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The DECS in a 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="6">1 June 1987</st1:date> ordered
private respondent School to enroll <span class="SpellE">petitioners's</span>
children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter however refused to
enroll these students, prompting petitioners to file an action for <i>mandamus</i>
in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="6">11 June 1987</st1:date>, to maintain the status
quo between the parties, ordered the temporary enrollment of petitioners'
children." (Resolution - G.R. No. 90063, pp. 1-4)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While Civil Case No. Q-51039 was being considered on appeal by
the Court of Appeals and later the Supreme <span class="GramE">Court,</span> the
proceedings were also going on in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-89-2357,

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court of Appeals should have been aware that in the
related case (G.R. No. 90063), we had already set aside the writ of preliminary

injunction invalid and sustained the school's position that there was no

<blockquote>"As the Court of Appeals pointed out, petitioners here failed
to exhaust their administrative remedies before resorting to court action, as
they had failed to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) see the
principal of Grace Christian on 29 May 1987, their scheduled conference date;
(b) wait for the resolution of the letter of reconsideration/clarification of
1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated 1 June 1987 filed by Grace
Christian with the DECS Assistant Regional Director; and (c) appeal to the DECS
Secretary to finally resolve their disagreements with Grace Christian, the
right to appeal from the decision of a subordinate officer to a superior one
constituting 'a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law' within the meaning of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Education Act of 1982 vests in the DECS the primary authority to
hear and resolve disputes by and among members of the educational community
similar to those between petitioners and Grace Christian.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction lies only when
the right sought to be enforced is clear, unmistakable and indubitable (Rivera
v. <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, 144 SCRA 643 [1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, no such clear right was
shown.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that private schools
-- not unlike public utilities and other private corporations whose businesses
impinge on the public interest -- are subject to reasonable regulation and
supervision of the State (Const., Art. <span class="GramE">XIV [4] [1]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, however, private schools
have the right to establish reasonable rules and regulations for the admission,
discipline and promotion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>students.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This right to establish and enforce
reasonable rules and regulations extends as well to parents and parent-teacher
associations, as parents are under a social and moral (if not legal)
obligation, individually and collectively, to assist and cooperate with the
schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, since
petitioners have failed to comply with the conditions and prerequisites for
admission, i.e., registration within the prescribed dates, payment of
duly-approved­ tuition fees, and compliance with school rules and regulations,
Grace Christian cannot be regarded as having acted arbitrarily or capriciously
in refusing to re-enroll petitioners' children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>"Lastly, where relations between parents and students on the
one hand, and teachers and administrators upon the other hand, have
deteriorated to the level here exhibited, a private school may, in the interest
of the rest of the student body and of the faculty and management as a whole,
and of the children of the parents affected, require the affected children to
be enrolled elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The maintenance
of a morally conducive and orderly educational environment will be seriously <span class="SpellE">imperilled</span> if, under the circumstances of this case, Grace
Christian is forced to admit petitioners' children and to reintegrate them to
the student body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may even be argued
that petitioners' children have been innocent victims in a deplorable
confrontation between some parents and respondent School, but the situation
here finds some analogy in labor cases where, because of pre-existing and
supervening strained relations, reinstatement is not always a feasible
solution." (G.R. No. 90063, December 12, 1989, pp. 5-6; 7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue before us was the right to enroll in high school of
students who graduated from the elementary department of the same
institution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exactly the same issue is
raised in the case which gave rise to the contempt order and to the present
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the common facts of the
two cases, both the DECS and this Court have found the petitioners' position
valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot close this case without deploring the action of Vicente
<span class="SpellE">Luy</span> and his counsel for filing Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-89-2357 in 1989 when exactly the same issues were already before
Branch 79 in Civil Case No.</span> Q-51039 filed by, among others, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Luy</span> in 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
results not only in unnecessarily clogging the heavily burdened dockets of our
courts but also in the unseemly sight of two Branches of the same trial court,
and two Divisions of the Court of Appeals issuing contradictory decisions - one
in favor of the school and the other in favor of the students and their
parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This problem of forum-shopping
is now before our Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending any amendment of the Rules or a circular remedying this
problem, lawyers and litigants alike are warned to be more candid with courts
of justice and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not </span>engage in
forum-shopping through deliberate splitting of actions or appeals in the hope
that even as one case is dismissed, another would still be open.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in this case was also misled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"It is important to note that Civil Case No. Q-51039 was filed
for the purpose of requiring appellants to maintain the eight (8) students in
the roll of students in the Elementary Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This prayer was granted when the court issued
the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction asked for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herein appellants thereafter complied with
the said order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only when the
school refused to admit the eight (8) students in its High School Department
that they filed the motion for contempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said motion was denied because what the initial petition prayed for was
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to maintain the
enrolment in the Elementary Department of the students and not their admission
in the High School Department of said school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the right of the students to be admitted in the High School
Department was not in issue hence, the court was correct in ruling that it had
no jurisdiction to declare the appellants in contempt of court for the act
complained of, thereby dismissing the charge without considering its merits."

but also high <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">school </span>students.</p>

<p class="BODY">No thinking person can dispute the fact that our country is
suffering from the effects of a serious deterioration of academic and other standards
in our educational system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court is
disturbed by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">big </span>number of
candidates taking the bar examinations who, after six (6) years in the
elementary grades, four (4) years in high school, and eight (8) years in

give to bar examination questions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

drastic upgrading of educational standards especially in the elementary and

<p class="BODY">It is for the above reason that Government should uphold and
encourage schools and colleges which endeavor to maintain the highest standards
of education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have consistently
sustained the rights of students to legitimately address their grievances both
to school authorities, media, and the general public to the extent of sometimes
countenancing uncivil and rowdy <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we have not hesitated to strike down
violence and anarchy when certain students and their inevitable supporters
misuse the grant of "ordered liberty" mandated by the
Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Educators who insist on
high standards and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">who </span>enforce

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J</i>.:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">I have reservations about the <u>ponencia</u> insofar as it
suggests that if the parents are not satisfied with the policies of the school
they are free to enroll their children elsewhere.  It is not as simple as that.  The school is not a strictly private business or an exclusive club
admission to which is entirely discretionary in its officials or
membership.  It is an enterprise
affected with public interest and as such does not have full freedom in
defining its policies.  The school has a
missionary and visionary purpose.  That
purpose transcends personal animosities and idiosyncrasies like those involved
in the case before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">The policies of the school are not its concern alone but also
that of the parents who have entrusted to it the education of their
children.  No less than the Constitution
recognizes the natural right and duty of the parents in the rearing of the
youth for civic efficiency and the development of moral character.  The mere fact that the parents have enrolled
their children in the school does not mean they have surrendered to it full
authority in the pursuit of the said objectives.  The education of the youth is a collaborative effort between the
parents and the school, and neither can deny the other its assigned role in
this endeavor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parents should have the right to examine the policies of the
school and to demand a higher quality of education for their children.  The method must, of course, be lawful.  But refusing the children re-admission simply
because their parents have incurred the displeasure of the school is to me an
arbitrary decision that this Court should not condone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>ponencia</u> cites our earlier resolution in Yap Chin Fah
v. Court of Appeals, where we said that the strained relations between the
parents and the school might justify the refusal of the latter to re-enroll the
students, in the interest of all concerned, including the students
themselves.  The analogy was there made
of labor cases, where reinstatement may not be considered a "feasible
solution" because of strained relations between the employee and
management.</p>

<p class="BODY">While I do not disagree with the ruling as a general principle, I
think it should be applied on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the
particular attendant circumstances, especially the reason for the strained
relations.  Conceivably, these may have
been caused by the school itself, and not always innocently.  Where, say, the school is run by an
authoritarian who obstinately refuses to listen to others, or it enforces
clearly whimsical or arbitrary policies, or it deliberately provokes the
parents precisely to cause the strained relations, I do not think the parents
should be faulted for protesting.  The
doctrine would clearly be inapplicable in such cases notwithstanding the
strained relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, there should be no question that not every complaint
of the parents is <u>per</u> <u>se</u> unreasonable.  It should not follow that because their complaints have strained
their relations with the school, their children can on that score alone be
denied re-enrollment.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am also thinking of another situation that could perhaps cause
us more serious concern unless we define narrow perimeters for the
doctrine.  We have said often enough,
most recently in Non v. Dames, 185 SCRA 523, that the enrollment of the student
does not connote the forfeiture of his constitutional rights, which he does not
leave at the "gateposts of the school." My fear is that in exercising
such rights, he may offend the sensibilities of the school and consequently
become <u>persona</u> <u>non</u> <u>grata</u>.  Shall we, following the said doctrine, sustain the school when it
refuses him re-admission for the sake of peace on the campus?  I submit that in this and similar cases - including
the case at bar - the academic freedom of the school to choose its students
should not be stretched beyond its constitutional limits.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is so easy to say that the parents may enroll their children
elsewhere if they do not like the school, and good riddance to all
concerned.  But there are other
considerations that in fairness, and to be realistic, should not just be
disregarded.  In the particular case of
Grace Christian High School, it may be that it is the nearest school that can
offer a Protestant upbringing to the children and their transfer to another
school of the same religion may entail more expense of time and money, not to
mention the psychological trauma of rejection and dislocation they may
suffer.  Such involuntary transfer may
not be the most feasible solution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In such circumstances, I suggest that the Court, instead of
recognizing the belligerency, as it were, should encourage an amicable
arrangement that will allow the children to re-enroll while at the same time
according the school and the parents another opportunity to sit down and reason
together (and in the process provide an example to the students).</p>

<p class="BODY">I venture the hope that the strained relations deplored by the
Court in the said resolution, which was promulgated on December 12, 1989,
almost one and a half years ago, may not be as acrimonious now as they were
then and that the tension between the parties may have sufficiently loosened by
now to allow mutual accommodation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that the school has graduated the children
from its elementary department, which would suggest that they are eligible by
its own standards for admission to its high school department.  I agree with the <u>ponencia</u> that
education in this country must be improved, but it is not the academic
proficiency of the students that is the issue in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The preliminary mandatory injunction issued by Judge Solano was
merely preliminary, subject to the results of the trial on the merits.  There was no deliberate defiance of the
resolution cited because the reason for the strained relations between the
parents and the school, and the degree of their hostility, was a legitimate
inquiry that had yet to be made.  Pending the decision of Civil Case No. 051039, the petitioners were
obliged to comply with the mandate of the court in the interest of the orderly
administration of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am not prepared to agree that the preliminary mandatory
injunction was a patently unlawful order that the petitioners could simply
ignore on their own inofficious decision that it was invalid.  That judgment was not for them to make.  They should understand that, as litigants,
they cannot reverse the judge; only a higher court may do that.  The writ being a presumably lawful process
of the trial court, the petitioners should have dutifully obeyed it, without
prejudice to their right to challenge it later in the appropriate proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals and to
dismiss the petition.</p>
