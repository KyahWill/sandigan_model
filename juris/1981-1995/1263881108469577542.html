<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 49.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Nepotism</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- (a) All appointments in the national,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Although
what <span class="GramE">was</span> extended to Benjamin was merely a designation
and not an appointment, the Civil Service Commission ruled that "the
prohibitive mantle on nepotism would include designation, because what cannot
be done directly cannot be done indirectly." It further held that Section
24(f) of Republic Act No. 2260 provides that no person appointed to a position </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the non-competitive service (now non-career)
shall perform the duties properly belonging to any position in the competitive
service </span>(now career service).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner, therefore, could not legally and validly designate Benjamin, who
successively occupied the non-career positions of Senior Executive <span style="">Assistant and Civil Security Officer, to the
position of Provincial Administrator, a career position under Section 4 of R.A.
No. 5185.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

directive and control of administrative and personnel service in the Provincial
Office, petitioner filed the instant petition invoking the following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent</span>
Commission has committed a (sic) grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction when it held that the position of provincial
administrator is not a primarily-confidential position because said ruling is
diametrically opposed to, and in utter disregard of rulings of this Honorable
Court as to what is a primarily-confidential position under Article XII-B, Sec.
2 of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>B.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission gravely abused its
discretion and acted without jurisdiction when it arrogated unto itself the
power to review a designation made by petitioner by virtue of the powers in him
vested under Section 2077 of the Revised Administrative Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission exceeded its
jurisdiction when it gave due course to the complaint of private respondent and
thereafter promulgated the resolutions under question in this petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>D.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no appeal, nor any other plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law available to
petitioner to have the questioned resolutions of respondent Commission reviewed
and thereafter nullified, revoked and set aside, other than this recourse to a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the Comment filed for
the respondent Commission on 7 October 1985, the Solicitor General sustains the
challenged resolutions and contends that the position of Provincial
Administrator is intended to be part of the career system and since it requires
a specific civil service eligibility, it belongs to the career service under
Section 5(1) of P.D. No. 807 and has not been declared primarily confidential
by the President pursuant to Section 1 of P.D. No. 868; that the Commission has
the authority to review, disapprove, and set aside even mere <u>designations</u>,
as distinguished from appointments, for Section 2 of P.D. No. 807 vests in it
the power to enforce the laws and rules governing the selection, utilization,
training and discipline of civil servants; and that it can act on Sangalang's
complaint pursuant to Section 37 of P.D. No. 807, for what he filed was not an
action for <u>q</u></span><u>uo</u> <u>warranto</u>, <span style="">but an administrative complaint to correct a violation of the Civil
Service law and rules </span>which <span style="">involved
public service and the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;

as the real parties in interest, and the relator at whose instigation the
proceedings are instituted need only show that he is a citizen and as such
interested in the execution of the laws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 11 December 1985, petitioner
filed his Reply to the Comment insisting therein that the duties, functions and
responsibilities of the Provincial Administrator render said position primarily
confidential in nature; the requirement of a specific service eligibility and
absence of a </span>presidential <span style="">declaration
that the position is primarily confidential do not place the said position in
the career service; the position of Provincial Administrator is in the
non-career service; and that the </span><u>Benitez</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Paredes</u>
<span style="">and </span><u><span style="">Tañada</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">vs</span></u><span style="">. </span><u>Tuvera</u> <span style="">cases
are not applicable in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner insists that the controlling doctrines are those enunciated
in </span><u>Salazar</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Mathay</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">where this Court held that there are
two instances when a position may be considered primarily confidential, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) when the President, upon
recommendation of the Commissioner of Civil Service (now Civil Service
Commission) has declared a position to be primarily confidential; and (2) in
the absence of such declaration, when by the very nature of the functions of
the office, there exists close intimacy between the appointee and the
appointing power which insures freedom of intercourse without embarrassment or
freedom from misgiving or betrayals of personal trust or confidential matters
of state and <u>Piñero</u></span><span style=""> </span><u>vs</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Hechanova</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">where this Court ruled that at least,
since the enactment of the 1959 Civil Service Act (R.A. No. 2260), it is the
nature of the position that finally determines whether a position is primarily
confidential, policy determining, or highly technical and that executive
pronouncements can be no more than initial determinations that are not
conclusive in case of conflict, which must be so, or else "it would then
lie within the discretion of the Chief Executive to deny to any officer, by
executive fiat, the protection of section 4, Article XII of the
Constitution."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his Rejoinder filed on
</span><st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="12"><span style="">16 December 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Solicitor General states that the rulings in the </span><u>Salazar</u>
<span style="">and </span><u>Piñero</u> <span style="">cases have been modified and superseded by
Section 6 of P.D. No. 807, and by the third paragraph of Section 1 of P.D. No.
868, which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Any provision of law authorizing any official, other than the
President, to declare positions policy-determining, primarily confidential or
highly technical which are exempt from the Civil Service Law and rules is
hereby repealed, and only the President may declare a position
policy-determining, highly technical or primarily confidential, upon
recommendation of the Civil Service Commission, the Budget Commission and the
Presidential Reorganization Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Solicitor General
further asseverates that the Commission's giving due course to the complaint of
Sangalang is manifestly </span><span style="">valid </span><span style="">and legal for it is also in accordance with
the declared policies of the State provided for in Section 2 of P.D. </span><span style="">No. 807.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the Resolution of </span><st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="2"><span style="">9
 February </span><span style="">1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">this Court gave due course to the petition and required the parties to
submit simultaneous memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall take </span>up <span style="">the issues in the order they are presented
above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The first issue becomes important because if the questioned
position is <span style="">primarily </span>confidential,
Section 49 of P.D. No. 807 on nepotism would not apply in the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, however, petitioner
did not raise it in the letter to the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission
dated <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="1">18 January 1983</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the contrary, he
submits, or otherwise admits therein, that said position is not primarily
confidential for it belongs to the <u>career</u> <u>service</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even emphasized this fact with an air of
absolute certainty, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, may I emphasize
that what is prohibited under Sec. 49 of P.D. 807 is the <u>appointment</u> <u>of</u>
<u>a</u> <u>relative</u> <u>to</u> <u>a</u> <u>career</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Service</u>

<blockquote>(<span class="GramE">capitalization</span>
supplied for emphasis).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The sole ground invoked
by him for exemption from the rule on nepotism is, as above indicated:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the rule does not apply to <u>designation</u>

ruled that the "prohibitive mantle on nepotism would include designation,
because what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly" and, more
specifically, only when he filed his motion to reconsider said resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking, estoppel has bound
petitioner to his prior admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per
Article 1431 of the Civil Code, through estoppel an admission or representation
is rendered conclusive upon the person making it, and cannot be denied or
disproved as against the person relying thereon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="">this Court had the occasion to rule
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is plain that, at least since the enactment of the 1959
Civil Service Act (R.A. 2260), it is the <u>nature</u> of the position which
finally determines whether a position is primarily confidential, policy
determining or highly technical.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Executive pronouncements can be no more than initial determinations that
are not conclusive in case of conflict.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And it must be so or else it would then lie within the discretion of the
Chief Executive to deny to any officer, by executive fiat, the protection of
Section 4, Article XII<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This rule stands despite
the third paragraph of Section 1 of P.D. No. 868 which pertinently reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x and only the President may declare a position
policy-determining, highly technical or primarily confidential, upon
recommendation of the Civil Service Commission, the Budget Commission and the
Presidential Reorganization Commission."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="">for</span></span><span style=""> the reason
that the latter may be considered merely as the initial determination of the
Executive, which in no case forecloses judicial review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rule that exclusively vests upon the
Executive the power to declare what position may be considered
policy-determining, primarily confidential, or highly technical would subvert
the provision on the civil service under the 1973 Constitution which was then
in force at the time the decree was promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, Section 2 of Article XII of
said Constitution makes reference to positions <u>which</u> <u>are</u>
policy-determining, primarily confidential, or highly technical </span><u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">nature</span></u><span style="">," thereby leaving no room for doubt
that, indeed, it is the <u>nature</u> of the position which finally determines
whether it falls within the above mentioned classification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1987 Constitution retains this rule when
in </span>Section <span style="">2 of Article IX-<span class="GramE">C,</span> it clearly makes reference to "positions </span><u>which</u>

<p class="BODY">We likewise agree with the public respondent that there is one
further obstacle to the occupation by Benjamin Laurel of the position of
Provincial Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time he
was designated as Acting Provincial Administrator, he was holding the position
of Senior Executive Assistant in the Office of the Governor, a primarily
confidential position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was thereafter
promoted as Civil Security Officer, also a primarily confidential
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both positions belong to the
non-career service under Section 6 of P.D. No. 807.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly ruled by the public respondent,
petitioner cannot legally and validly designate Benjamin Laurel as Acting
Provincial Administrator, a career position, because Section 24(f) of R.A. No.
2260 provides that no person appointed to a position in the non-competitive
service (now non-career) shall perform the duties properly belonging to any
position in the competitive service (now career service).</p>

<span style="">this Court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x All the authorities unite in saying that the term 'appoint'

this Court, per Mr. Justice Isagani M. Cruz, stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Designation may also be loosely defined as an appointment
because it likewise involves the naming of a particular person to a specified
public office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the common
understanding of the term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
where the person is merely designated and not appointed, the implication is
that he shall hold the office only in a temporary capacity and may be replaced
at will by the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this sense, the designation is considered only an acting or temporary
appointment, which does not confer security of tenure on the person
named."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It seems clear to <span class="GramE">Us</span> that Section 49 of
P.D. No. 807 does not suggest that designation should be differentiated from
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reading this section with
Section 25 of said decree, career service positions may be filled up only by
appointment, either permanent or temporary; hence a <u>designation</u> of a
person to fill it up because it is vacant, is necessarily included in the term
appointment, for it precisely accomplishes the same purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, if a <u>designation</u> is not to
be deemed included in the term <u>appointment</u> under Section 49 of P.D. No.
807, then the prohibition on nepotism would be meaningless and toothless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any appointing authority may circumvent it by
merely designating, and not appointing, a relative within the prohibited degree
to a vacant position in the career service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, as correctly stated by public respondent, "<span class="GramE">what</span> cannot be done directly cannot be done
indirectly."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">3. As regards the last issue, <span class="GramE">We</span> rule
that the letter-complaint of Sangalang was validly given due course by public
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, as <span style="">shown </span>above, there was a violation of
law committed by petitioner in designating his brother as Acting Provincial
Administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any citizen of the
Philippines may bring that matter to the attention of the Civil Service
Commission for appropriate action conformably with its role as the central
personnel agency to set standards and to enforce the laws and rules governing
the selection, utilization, training and discipline of civil servants,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>

Moreover, Section 37 of the decree expressly allows a private citizen to
directly file with the Civil Service Commission a complaint against a
government official or employee, in which case it may hear and decide the case
or may deputize any department or agency or official or group of officials to
conduct an investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The results of
the investigation shall be submitted to the Commission with recommendation as
to the penalty to be imposed or other action to be taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This provision gives teeth to the
constitutional exhortation that a public office is a public trust and public
officers and employees must at all times be, <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">alia</span></u><span style="">, </span>accountable to the people.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
An ordinary citizen who brings to the attention of the appropriate office any
act or conduct of a government official or employee which betrays the public
interest deserves nothing less than the praises, support and encouragement of
society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vigilance of the citizenry
is vital in <span style="">a </span>democracy.</p>
