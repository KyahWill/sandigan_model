<p class="BODY">From the testimonies in court of three (3) witnesses,
namely:  Jennis Castro (brother of the
victim); Dr. Tomas Refe, Senior Medico-Legal Officer, NBI; Elizabeth Castro
(wife of the victim), the version of the prosecution as to the commission of
the offense, may be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Jennis Castro testified that at about 3:30 p.m. of 14 August
1986, he and his brother, Pat. Aquiles Castro, rode on a motorcycle from his said
brother's house to Sitio Sumimbang, Daanbantayan, Cebu to get a fighting cock
from Roel Punay.  Upon their reaching
barangay Bitoon, they learned that Roel Punay had already left, but the uncle
of Roel, Filemon Punay, offered and treated them with young coconuts.  While his brother Aquiles rested for a while
and sat down on a piece of wood lying near the road, he himself (the witness)
proceeded to watch a cockfight about six (6) meters distant from the place
where his brother, Pat. Aquiles Castro was seated.  While he was watching the cockfight, he saw Carlito Gulpan
converse with his brother for about twenty five (25) minutes, followed by Edgar
Gulpan, who also conversed with his brother.  About five (5) minutes thereafter, he heard a gunshot coming from the
place where his brother was seated.  Turning his head, he saw his brother roll on the ground; he also saw two
(2) persons, each with a .45 caliber pistol and another person wearing a blue
T-shirt shoot at his brother.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> He
recognized the faces of the two (2) persons holding the pistols.  He also identified and pointed to accused
Ernie Lambujon as the one wearing a blue T-shirt and who shot his brother.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before running towards the cornfields, continued the witness
(Jennis Castro), he stared for about five (5) to seven (7) seconds at the two
(2) persons with pistols.  On the way to
the cornfields, he heard another gunshot.  And when he was already in the cornfields, he heard still another
gunshot; all in all he heard four (4) gunshots.  He looked back to see what had happened to his brother and saw
him rolled on the ground.  He also saw
Alfredo Argawanon (he knows him because he was arrested in a stabbing incident
and was mauled by his brother) take his brother's pistol and fire it once and
another person whom he does not know take his brother's wallet and wrist
watch.  He was so scared, according to
Jennis Castro, upon seeing these things, so he ran towards the highway, boarded
a tricycle and went home.  He then sent
somebody to inform the police and the police took his brother's body to their
house in Paypay, Daanbantayan, Cebu where a doctor examined the body.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Pat. Castro's body was examined on 21 August 1986 by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dr. </span>Tomas Refe, the Senior
Medico-Legal Officer of the NBI, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Central

Refe performed the autopsy on the cadaver of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

report (Exhibit "A").  The
victim sustained various injuries, but the fatal wounds were the following:</p>

<blockquote>"gunshot wounds-ovaloid and with the
longest axis running downwards and laterally measuring 1 x 1.2 cms., with
contused abraded collar, 2/10 cms. wide at the upper border and 1/10 cms. wide
at its lower border located at the occipital region or back portion of the head
right side; 4 cms. above and 4 cms. behind the right external auditory meatus
or the right opening of the ear; 8 cms. from the anterior median line right,

and soft tissues fracturing the back portion of the skull at the base making an
exit fall 1.2 x 1.5 cms. located at the mandibular region right side 8 cms.
from the anterior median line; 6 cms. below and 10 cms. infront of the right
external auditory meatus."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The victim died of shock secondary to multiple gunshot wounds
(Exhibit "A-1").</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the defense is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused Ernie Lambujon testified that he was engaged in
"bobo fishing" since 1982 until he was arrested on 30 August <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1986 </span>in the house of Beata Lauron, a
friend of his sister Perla Lambujon in Malukbalok, Agujo, Daanbantayan,
Cebu.  He went there on 29 August 1986
to attend the fiesta but he, together with his sister Perla Lambujon and Beata
Lauron were arrested by Capt. Abadiano and his men, allegedly for being members
of the NPA.  They were brought to the PC
Camp in Bogo and arrived there at 5-6 o'clock in the morning of 31 August 1986.  They were investigated in separate rooms.  He did not know whether the investigation
was reduced to writing.  He was asked
whether it was true that he was a member of the NPA, and he told the
investigators that he was a fisherman from Bantayan Island.  In the afternoon of the same day, he was
brought to the municipal jail of Bogo.  He further testified that at the time he was arrested in Malukbalok,
Daanbantayan, Cebu and in the evening of 30 August 1986, he was never asked
about the death of Pat. Castro.  After
his arrest, he was manhandled by the men of Capt. Abadiano when he told them
that he was not a member of the NPA.  In
the morning of 31 August 1986, he was again maltreated because he denied being
a member of the NPA.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lambujon further testified that it is not true that he was one of
those who shot Pat. Castro in the afternoon of 14 August 1986 at Bgy.
Sumimbang, because as early as 4:30 a.m. of 14 August 1986 he was already at
sea fishing and went home at about 1: p.m. or 2:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">p.m.  </span>After taking a bath
in the well, he worked on the reserved bobo until 4:30 or 5:30 in the
afternoon.  He claimed that he had never
been to Sumimbang and does not even know where the place is located.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Lambujon affirmed that he was engaged in
"bobo fishing." He also re-affirmed that he was arrested on 30 August
1986 allegedly for being a member of the NPA but not for being caught in
possession of a firearm without a license to carry, in the house of Juan
Sericon and that he did not know that he was facing a charge of illegal
possession of firearm.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> He
admitted that he was investigated at the PC Camp in Bogo, Cebu but denied
having been confronted by one Jennis Castro and that he was pointed to as one
(among several) who shot Pat. Castro.  He maintained that the first time he saw Jennis Castro was when the
latter testified in court and that before that date, he did not know Jennis
Castro and he had no ill-feelings towards him.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Witness for the defense, Beata Lauron Arrogancia, testified that
she was picked up by police authorities for being suspected as a
subversive.  She further testified that
the ones responsible for the death of Pat. Castro were Teddy Sericon and a
certain Rubin, members of the sparrow unit of the NPA, the liquidation squad of
the CPP-NPA and that she acted only as lookout together with Ernesto Arabis and
Fredo Argawanon.  She asserted that she
only heard about the names of those responsible for the killing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
She said that she gave this information because she was manhandled and told
that if she would not tell the truth, her son would be killed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal deserves careful scrutiny and consider­ation.  In finding the accused-appellant guilty of
the crime charged, the trial court relied heavily on the identifi­cation made
in the lone testimony of Jennis Castro, brother of the victim.  It is to be noted that the lower court
found, based on circumstantial evidence, that the accused-appellant was
positively identified by the prosecution witness (Jennis Castro) as one of
those who killed the victim.  It is,
however, axiomatic in criminal law that the quantum of evidence required for
the conviction of an accused is that which produces moral certainty in an
uprejudiced mind that the accused is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  If the evidence is susceptible of two (2)
interpretations, one inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and the
other, inconsistent with his guilt, the accused must be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information, to begin with, explicitly alleges that three (3)
persons, including accused-appellant, conspired together in shooting and
killing the deceased Pat. Castro with two (2) .45 caliber pistols and shooting
the deceased <u>twice</u> at the back of the head with said two (2) .45 caliber
pistols.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the alleged lone eyewitness to the shooting of
the victim, in the person of Jennis Castro, was not satisfied with the
participation of three (3) killers only but went on to state, in his testimony
on cross-examination, that there were four (4) and even five (5) perpetrators
involved in the killing of the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> In
his direct testimony, there appears to be three (3) persons who shot Pat.
Castro, namely:  the two (2) persons
each with .45 caliber pistols and the third wearing a blue T-shirt who Jennis
Castro said was accused-appellant Ernie Lambujon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, however, this same alleged lone eyewitness testified that
there were four (4) persons who fired at Pat. Castro, apparently including
accused-appellant Ernie Lambujon.  On
cross-examination, Jennis Castro testified thus:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Q.  <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>You
told the court that there was one guy who was stocky and whom <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">you </span>could not recognize up to the

watch of your brother was one of the 2 men whom you saw for the first time who
shot your brother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

<blockquote>  Q.  Do you mean to tell the court that there were only 2 persons including

<blockquote>  A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Yes,
sir</u>.  When I craved my neck in order
to look at the <u>place there were 4 men</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
when you heard the 1st and 2nd shot how many men did you see near your brother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2
men standing at his side.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  On the third shot when you started running towards the cornfield how
many men did you see near your brother when you heard the 3rd shot?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.  <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I could not see how many because my back
was towards them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
the shot how many men?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.  There were already 4:  Alfredo
Argawanon who got the sidearm and these 2 men who had .45 caliber pistols and
one who was at the back." (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From this testimony, it appears that there were only four (4)
persons who were seen by the witness (Jennies Castro) near the body of Pat.
Castro:  namely:  Argawanon, the two (2) persons with .45
caliber pistols each, and the person who was at the back of the victim.  It also appears from the above testimony
that appellant Lambujon was not pinpointed as present at the scene of the
killing of Pat. Castro, notwithstanding the trial court's questions to Jennie Castro.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if Jennis Castro were to be believed that he saw accused-appellant
Ernie Lambujon fire the second shot, then such pretension would make the number
of persons present and near the body of Pat. Castro five (5) and not four (4)
in number, as he had earlier emphatically declared.  There were only four (4) persons who were near the body of Pat.
Castro as indicated, and of the four (4) persons, Ernie Lambujon was not
conclusively included and, therefore, he could not be the person who fired the
second shot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>declared in the
direct testimony of Jennis Castro.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Jennis Castro also testified at one point that the
second shot came from the two (2) men who fired the first shot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
He likewise stressed to the trial court that although he allegedly saw Lambujon
FOR THE FIRST TIME during the incident on 14 August 1986, he remembered very
clearly his face because he stared at Lambujon after he had stared at the two
(2) men with pistols for about 5-7 seconds, before he ran towards the
cornfield.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
And yet, when asked through what means and manner did he identify Lambujon
considering that it was the first time he saw him, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">is, </span>during the killing of his brother, he replied that it was by
staring at him.  In short, he identified
accused-appellant by staring at him <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span><u>his</u> <u>blue</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">T-shirt</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.   </span>But
how could the witness have stared at Lambujon for 5-7 seconds when he
admittedly ran to the cornfields after staring for 5-7 seconds at the persons
carrying the .45 caliber pistols?</p>

<p class="BODY">In his sworn statement (Exhibit 3), when asked to identify the
person he saw who killed his brother, Jennis Castro pointed to Lambujon.  At that time he could identify him but for
another reason:  he (Lambujon) shouted
after allegedly shooting his brother the following words:  "Ayaw mo pagdagan kay NPA ni." (Do
not run because this is NPA) [Exhibit 3-F].</p>

<p class="BODY">The records additionally show that when Jennis Castro was earlier
investigated by PC-INP Owen Labajos, and was asked to point to the killer of
his brother, witness pointed to Lambujon by saying:  "Morag mao na siya" (It seems he is the one)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
an indication that he was not sure that appellant was the killer.  This matter was not explained or rebutted by
the prosecution by putting back Jennis Castro on the witness stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the PC authorities that during their raid on the
house of the suspects, accused-appellant was present, cannot be employed to
justify a judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence.  For the circumstances must be "an
unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion, which points
to the defendant to the exclusion of all others, as the guilty person."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It would have been a different conclusion if the prosecution witness saw herein
accused-appellant kill the victim and testified accordingly at all times and on
all occasions.  Such would have been

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that accused Argawanon in his sworn statement
(Exhs. 1, 1-A, 1-B, 1-C, 1-D, 1-E and 1-F) declared that it was not Lambujon
who killed Pat. Castro but Teddy Sericon and his companion whom he does not
know; and that Lambujon was not present at Sumimbang when Pat. Castro was
killed.  The same testimony was made by
Bartolome Arabis (Exhibit 2) and Beata Lauron (Exhibit 4, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C and
4-D).  In <u>People vs. Keller</u> <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the following passage from 1 Moore on Facts was quoted with approval by the
Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"18. Testimony
May Be Partly Credited and Partly Rejected:  Triers of facts are not bound to believe all that any witness has said;
they may accept some portions of his testimony and reject other portions,

<blockquote>Even when witnesses are found to have deliberately falsefied in
some material particulars, the jury are not required to reject the whole of
their uncorroborated testimony, but may credit such portions as they deem
worthy of belief."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The witness (Jennis Castro) admitted that he did not give any
statement to the police immediately after the kill­ing of his brother on 14
August 1986 and that it was only his nephew (the son of the deceased) who
informed the police.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>He also admitted that it was only on
30 August 1986 when he was called by the police that he was asked for a
statement, in other words, he was asked to make a statement only at the time
when Lambujon was arrested.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> At
this point, it may be noted that in his statement before the police, when asked
as to who killed the victim, Jennis Castro could only identify Alfredo
Argawanon, and that the others were not known to him<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
and that when asked by the police investigator whether he personally knew who
killed Pat. Castro, Jennis Castro answered:  "Morag mao ni <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">siya", </span>pointing
to Lambujon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
This identification made by Jennis Castro is obviously inadequate not only as
to its content but also as to the setting where made.  Rule 115 Sec. 1(f) of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  Rights of
accused at the trial.  – In all criminal
prosecutions, the accused shall be entitled:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>(f) To confront and
cross-examine the witnesses against him at the trial.  Either party may utilize as part of its evidence the testimony of
a witness who is deceased, out of or can not with due diligence be found in the
Philippines, unavailable or otherwise unable to testify, given in another case
or proceeding, judicial or administrative, involving the same parties and
subject matter, the adverse party having had the opportunity to cross-examine
him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, if indeed the two (2) Castro brothers were watching
the cockfight when the alleged four (4) persons attacked Pat. Castro, it is
quite difficult to comprehend that, considering that he (witness) was only six
(6) meters away from his brother,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
nothing was done to him as he was able to run and hide.  It seems out of the ordinary that the
assailants, allegedly, two (2) of them armed with .45 caliber pistols would let
Jennis Castro (an eye witness to the killing) loose and not put him out of the
way.  It is also quite unbelievable that
despite his said distance, he (Jennis Castro) was able to identify the
accused-appellant and was able to hear one of the assailants shout, to
wit:  "Ayaw mo pagdagan kay NPA
ni."</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to the above extrajudicial statements of Jennis
Castro, the trial court considered the following circumstantial evidence in
convicting the appellant Lambujon, to wit:  his presence at the house of one of the accused during the raid;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
the revolver of Pat. Castro which was allegedly found in accused-appellant's
possession during the raid;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> positive
testimony of Jennis Castro that the one who fired the second shot was the one
wearing a blue T-shirt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> We
do not agree with the trial court's conclusion that the aforecited evidence are
corroborative of Jennis Castro's incriminating testimony against the
accused-appellant.  Circumstantial
evidence may be characterized as that evidence which proves a fact or series of
facts from which the facts in issue may be established by inference.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
This Court cannot infer from said evidence, the identity of the victim's
assailant nor the actual participation of the appellant Lambujon in the crime
charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lambujon, it should be noted, interposed the defense of
alibi.  He testified that on that
fateful day when the crime was committed, he was with his father fishing at
Tangigue Island, Madridejos, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>more
or less 15-20 miles off the west coast of Daanbantayan where the crime occured.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>According to him, he was with his
father from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">4:30 </span>a.m. to 1:00
p.m. of the day in question and then he worked on reserved "bobo"
until past <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">5:00 p.m.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
This was corro­borated by the testimony of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">his </span>father.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Granting that the defense of alibi is a weak defense, that fact
alone does not justify the judgment of conviction against the
accused-appellant.  The burden of proof
in criminal cases is on the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Alibi is generally a weak defense since it is easy to concoct and difficult to
disprove.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
However, when the identification of the accused as the author of the crime
charged is inconclusive or unreliable, alibi assumes importance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in this case where the proof of the appellant's participation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the crime charged consists only of
the uncorroborated testimony of Jennis Castro, and where such testimony lacks
details and credibility, the defense of alibi, should be given more
weight.  Failing in its task to prove
that the appellant is the author of the crime, the prosecution cannot rely upon
the weakness of the defense of alibi in order to secure a conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On another issue:  was the
arrest of accused-appellant Lambujon lawful?  Was the confiscation of a firearm allegedly found in his possession
lawful and done in a valid manner?</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant declared that he was arrested without a warrant
of arrest, and this is not denied by the prosecution.  The records of the case disclose that when the PC authorities
went to the house of Sericon for the purpose of arresting him upon information
given to them, they found Lambujon in that house and found him in possession of
a firearm.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
They did not at the time have any warrant of arrest<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> or</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">search </span>warrant
against Lambujon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. IV, Sec. 3 of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of
whatever nature and for any purpose shall not be violated, and no search
warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be
determined by the judge, or such other responsible officer as may be authorized
by law, after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the
witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched
and the persons or things to be seized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This constitutional provision is a safeguard against wanton and unreasonable
invasion of the privacy and liberty of a citizen as to his person, papers and
effects.  The right of a person to be
secure against any unreasonable seizure of his body and any deprivation of his
liberty is a most basic and fundamental one.  A statute, rule or situation which allows exceptions to the requirement
of a warrant of arrest or search warrant must be strictly construed.  We cannot liberally consider arrests or
seizures without warrant or extend their application beyond the cases specifically
provided or allowed by law.  To do so
would infringe upon personal liberty and set back a basic right so often
violated and yet, so deserving of full protection and vindication.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, we find no compelling reason for the haste
with which the arresting officers arrested the accused-appellant.  They were still fishing for evidence of a
crime not yet ascertained.  The
subsequent recovery of the firearm allegedly used in the commission of the
crime, with the accused-appellant cannot make the arrest any less
unlawful.  If an arrest without warrant
is unlawful at the moment it is made, generally nothing that happens or is
discovered afterwards can make it lawful.  The fruit of a poisoned tree is necessarily tainted.  We fail to see why the authorities failed to
first go through the process of obtaining a warrant of arrest, if indeed they
had reasonable ground to believe that the accused-appellant had truly committed
a crime.  There is no showing on record
that there was a real apprehension that the accused-appellant was on the verge
of flight or escape nor a showing that his whereabouts were unknown.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be presumed that there was a waiver, or that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">consent </span>was given by the
accused-appellant to be searched and arrested simply because he failed to
object or question the same when made.  As pointed out by Mr. Justice Laurel in the case of <u>Pasion Vda. de
Garcia vs. Locsin</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">As the constitutional guaranty is not
dependent upon any affirmative act of the citizen, the courts do not place the
citizen in the position of either contesting an officer's authority by force,
or waiving his </span>constitutional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">rights,
but instead they hold that a peaceful submission to a search or seizure is not
a consent o</span>r <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">invitation thereto,
but is merely a demonstration of regard for the supremacy of the law." (56
C.J., pp. 1180-1181)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, we find the warrantless arrest of Lambujon illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the inconclusive evidence presented by the prosecution on
the alleged participation of the accused-appellant Lambujon in the killing of
Pat. Aquiles Castro, reasonable doubt has set in.  The prosecution's failure to overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence entitles the accused-appellant Lambujon to an ACQUITTAL.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we reverse the judgment of conviction rendered
by the trial court against Ernie Lambujon.  He is ACQUITTED of the crime charged, based on reasonable doubt, and the
Court orders his immediate release from detention unless he is held for some
other legal cause or ground.  Costs <u>de</u>
