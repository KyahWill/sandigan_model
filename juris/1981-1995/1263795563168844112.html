<p class="BODY">For review on <i>Certiorari</i> is respondent Appellate Court's 
(1) Resolution, dated <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">30 September 
1983</st1:date>, in AC-G. R. No. 23678-CR, disallowing petitioners' appeal for 
failure to take the necessary steps for the completion of the record within the 
period specified by said Court, and (2) the Resolution, dated 8 November 1984, 
denying <span>peti</span>tioners' Motion for Reconsideration.</p>
<p class="BODY">On 9 January 1979, petitioners were convicted by the then Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span>Leyte</span></span><span>, 
</span>Branch IV, at Palo, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, in Criminal Case No. 
763, of two (2) crimes of Rape and sentenced in each case to ten (10) years and 
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> mayor</em> to 
seventeen (17) years and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> After denial of a Motion for New Trial by 
said Court, they filed a Notice of Appeal on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="8">8 August 1979</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="8">31 August 1979</st1:date>, the Trial Court 
directed the Clerk of Court to transmit to the Appellate Court <em>the complete 
record of the case including the transcript of stenographic notes within five 
days from said date</em>.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, due to the loss of some of the stenographic notes, the 
Appellate Court, in a Resolution dated 11 January 1982, and upon previous 
comments obtained from petitioners and the Solicitor General, ordered the remand 
of the case to the Trial Court for the retaking of the testimony of defense 
witness, Father <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> Pastor, contained in the 
lost transcript of stenographic notes of stenographer Juliet <span class="SpellE">Parce</span>, and for the identification of Exhibits "G", "H", "4" 
and "4-A" of the prosecution and the defense, respectively.</p>
<p class="BODY">The required testimony was retaken by the Trial Court on 27 April 
1982 and on 1 June 1982, and forwarded together with the records by Deputy Clerk 
of Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, 
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Araullo</span>, 
on 8 June 1982, to the Appellate Court addressed to Elsa de Guzman, Third 
Division Clerk of the latter Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="5">17 May 
1983</st1:date>, the Appellate Court required <span>peti</span>tioners, within 
20 days from notice, to take the necessary steps for the completion of the <span class="GramE">records,</span> otherwise, the appealed would be dismissed in 
accordance with Section 1(h), Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">30 September 
1983</st1:date>, the Appellate Court:</p>
<blockquote>"Acting on the report of the Docket Division that petitioners had 
not complied with the resolution of May 17, 1983, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> requiring them to take the necessary steps for the 
completion of the records (transcripts) that have been pending since 1980, the 
Court RESOLVED TO DISMISS the appeal pursuant to Section 1(h) of Rule 50 of the 
Rules of Court."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="11">16 November 
1983</st1:date>, the Resolution of dismissal became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and entry of judgment was made on <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="12">19 December 1983</st1:date> by the <span class="GramE">Appellate Court.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="1">12 January 
1984</st1:date>, petitioners moved for reconsideration of the Order of dismissal 
arguing that what may have prompted the dismissal was that the retaken testimony 
of Fr. Pastor, which was forwarded to the Appellate Court, may not have been 
attached to the records.<span>&nbsp; </span>Commenting thereon, the Solicitor General 
maintained that the reconsideration sought was too late, entry of judgment 
having been already made, and the records remanded to the Trial Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="7">23 July 
1984</st1:date>, the Appellate Court issued a Resolution requiring petitioners 
"to verify and examine if the records are really complete, including the 
transcripts retaken as ordered by the resolution of <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1982</st1:date>, and to file a manifestation to 
that effect."</p>
<p class="BODY">Complying therewith, petitioners' new counsel (the former counsel 
having died on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="7">26 July 1984</st1:date>) 
submitted a Certification by the Deputy Clerk of Court of the Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Araullo</span>, reading:</p>
<blockquote><span>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> (t)he steno-type notes of former Stenographer <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Petilla</span> in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 763, <em>People of the Philippines vs. 
Wilfredo</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Advincula</em></span><em>, et al.</em>, 
taken March 5, 1974 could not be found <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> 
diligent efforts in locating the same by the employee in charge of keeping her 
notes.<span>&nbsp; </span>With regards to the steno-type notes of stenographer <span class="SpellE">Herminigilda</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span>, her notes 
were forwarded to her station in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> for transcription.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Until date, the same have not been submitted by said stenographer.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Required to comment thereon, the Solicitor General reiterated his 
position that the appeal should not be reinstated on the ground that in spite of 
the Appellate Court's Order to petitioners to take the necessary steps to 
complete the record, the same was still incomplete in that not only was the 
transcript of the stenographic notes containing the testimony of Fr. Pastor 
missing but that the transcript of the stenographic notes taken by stenographers 
<span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Petilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Herminigilda</span> <span class="SpellE">Aguila</span> had neither 
been transcribed.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="8" month="11">8 November 
1984</st1:date>, respondent Appellate Court found the comment of the Solicitor 
General well founded and denied petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration, since 
its Resolution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">30 September 
1983</st1:date> had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">At issue is the question of whether or not respondent Appellate 
Court committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing the appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">We are constrained to rule in the affirmative.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioners' right to a hearing on appeal has not been accorded full 
respect.</p>
<p class="BODY">In all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right of 
appeal in the manner prescribed by law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Because the right to appeal is granted by 
the statute, it is part of due process of law, denial of which violates the due 
process clause of the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
Appeal being an essential part of our judicial system, Courts should proceed 
with caution so as not to deprive a party of the right to appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Section 1 of Rule 50 under which respondent Court dismissed 
petitioners' appeal merely confers a power and does not impose a duty; and the 
same is not mandatory but merely directory which thus requires a great deal of 
circumspection, considering all the attendant circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">It was primarily because of the negligence and lackadaisical 
attitude of the Court stenographic reporters that the notes of the proceedings 
were either lost or not transcribed.<span>&nbsp; </span>This nonfeasance should not 
prejudice the right of the accused-appellants to have their convictions reviewed 
by a higher Court, especially since it is their liberty which is at stake.</p>
<p class="BODY">As early as <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="8">31 August 
1979</st1:date>, the Trial Court directed its Clerk of Court to transmit to the 
Appellate Court the complete records of the case, including the transcript of 
stenographic notes within five (5) days <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The Rules impose upon the stenographic 
reporters the duty to transcribe their stenographic notes of the proceedings, to 
certify to the correctness of the notes and the transcript thereof and to file 
the transcripts with the Clerk without unnecessary delay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The Rules further require, upon an appeal 
being taken, that the Clerk or Judge of the Court with whom the notice of appeal 
shall have been filed, must, within five (5) days after the filing of <span>the 
</span>notice, transmit to the Clerk of the Court to which the appeal is taken, 
the complete record in the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Rules require that 
the transcript of stenographic notes be also transmitted to the Clerk of the 
Appellate Court together with the record, or as soon thereafter as possible.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> It is the Clerk of Court who is primarily 
responsible for seeing to it that records of appealed cases as well as the 
transcripts of stenographic notes are properly sent to the Appellate Court 
without delay; although the party litigants should also see to it that the Court 
is made aware of any delay in action over their cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">It devolves upon the Government and not on the defendant to cause 
to be kept and in case of an appeal by the defendant, to be sent to the 
Appellate Court, a complete record of the proceedings in the Court of First 
Instance; and when the record so sent is deficient the appeal will not be 
dismissed on motion of the Government.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When the record sent in a criminal case 
does not contain all the testimony given in the Court below, and the testimony 
lacking can not be obtained, the case must be remanded to the Court below for a 
new trial to the extent of the missing evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The deprivation of petitioners' right to appeal in violation of 
due process vitiated the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> Order of 
respondent Appellate Court and is a valid ground for setting it aside.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, respondent Appellate Court's Resolutions of 
September 30, 1983 and November 8, 1984 in AC-G.R. CR No. 23678 entitled 
"<em>The People of the Philippines, Plaintiff-Appellee, versus, Alfredo 
Advincula, et al., Accused-Appellants</em>" are hereby SET ASIDE, and said Court 
is hereby directed to recall the entry of judgment, reinstate the appeal, and
