				<BR><STRONG>CORTES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The respondent, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, was
counsel for complainant <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Sanglay's</span>
aged mother who was sued for recovery of a sum of money in civil case No.
82-241 entitled <span class="SpellE"><u>Jovita</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Malan</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Deposito</u></span> v. <u>Flora</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Estrella</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Sanglay</u></span> in the Court of First Instance, Branch
XIII, Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff alleged that
she had made advance/partial payments initially in the amount of P36<span class="GramE">,032.20</span> and later an additional P5,000.00 for the purchase
of the defendant's property, which had been mortgaged to the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> Development Bank and was on the verge of being
foreclosed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Flora <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span> admitted to respondent <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
that she had received the said amounts but needed time to find a better
buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting by virtue of a special
power-of?attorney given him by Flora <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span>,
respondent Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> entered into a compromise
agreement with counsel for the plaintiff which was approved by the trial judge
and made the basis of the decision dated <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, a petition for relief from the compromise judgment
was filed on behalf of Flora <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was denied for lack of merit, whereupon,
notice of appeal was made, but pending perfection of the appeal, execution of
judgment was issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Flora E. <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span> filed with the Court
of Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to annul the order
of the trial judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding that the
assailed order was not tainted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to a
lack of jurisdiction, the appellate court denied due course for lack of merit
and dismissed the petition outright.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant in a letter addressed to the Chief Justice asked
for an inquiry and thorough review of the case alleging that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span></p>

<blockquote>. . . <span class="GramE">abused</span> the POWER OF ATTORNEY
entrusted to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The forged DEED OF
SALE document which he earlier intended to present as <span class="GramE">a vital</span>
evidence against plaintiff in court, was never presented anymore and the
COMPROMISE AGREEMENT entered by him without the knowledge and consent of our
mother was totally against our mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>, knowing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">that the receipt in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> was forged, coupled with high interest therein,
should not have agreed into such kind of agreement.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>For your kind information your honor, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
did not return to us anymore all our papers in his possession including the
original of the forged DEED OF SALE document, for reason that he did not sign
any receipt of acceptance from us. . . .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Letter dated April 25, 1983, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>. p. 2)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court by resolution dated <st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1983</st1:date> gave respondent ten (10) days to answer the
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his answer the respondent
explained the acts complained of and stated <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that Flora <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span> had admitted receiving the sums of
money sought to be recovered from her including the P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
where her signature in the receipt is alleged by the complainant to be a
forgery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the complainant filed his
reply, the Court referred the case to the Solicitor General for investigation,
report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General first set the case for hearing on <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1983</st1:date> where both
complainant and respondent appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
the latter requested time to get the services of a lawyer and the case was
reset for <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this date the respondent came but the
complainant was not present because he was allegedly ill.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was once more set for hearing on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the fact that complainant's
counsel was notified by registered mail, neither he nor the complainant
appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent upon request
presented his evidence ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> after which he was
given thirty (30) days to submit a memorandum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant given the same period to submit his memorandum alleged that
he did not know of the <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1984</st1:date>
hearing and filed a letter with documents attached consisting of thirty-two
(32) pages which he submitted as evidence, including the order of Judge Ricardo
D. <span class="SpellE">Galano</span>, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the basis of the review made of the antecedent facts of the
transactions entered into by Flora <span class="SpellE">Sanglay</span> over her
house and lot on 2 V. <span class="SpellE">Mapa</span> Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila,
and the intervention of the respondent Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
as her counsel and attorney-in-fact the Solicitor General arrived at the
following findings and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> has not
committed any act of misconduct calling for disciplinary action in entering
into a compromise agreement in behalf of the mother of herein complainant <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> E. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">Sanglay</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, because
respondent was duly authorized in a Special Power of Attorney (pp. 10-11,
Rec.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Court of Appeals
ruled that said compromise agreement cannot be challenged as having been
entered into without previous consent of complainant's mother because there was
the Special Power of Attorney.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Nor could she validly assail the validity of the Compromise
Agreement on the pretense that the same was executed by her counsel, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>,
without previously consulting her or without her knowledge and consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the record shows that she had executed a
special power of attorney in favor of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
authorizing the latter to appear for her in connection with Civil Case No.
129823 and, among others, "to offer and enter into any amicable settlement
and to sign the same" and "to offer and enter into any compromise and
to sign the compromise agreement".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xx</span> <span class="SpellE">xx</span>." <u>Respondent</u> <u>Judge,</u>
<u>therefore,</u> <u>correctly</u> <u>denied the</u> <u>petition</u> <u>for</u>
<u>relief</u> <u>as</u> <u>there</u> <u>was</u> <u>no</u> <u>showing</u> <u>that</u>
<u>petitioner</u> <u>had</u> <u>entered</u> <u>into</u> <u>the</u> <u>Compromise</u>
<u>Agreement</u> <u>by</u> <u>fraud,</u> <u>mistake,</u> <u>force</u> <u>or</u>
<u>violence</u> (p. 35; underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Complainant himself supplied evidence
showing that respondent Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> is
innocent of the charge that he had been unfaithful to his trust.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant submitted the order of Judge
Ricardo D. <span class="SpellE">Galano</span> dated October 3, 1981 holding,
among others, that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Compromise
Agreement entered into by respondent Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span>
was duly authorized by a Special Power of Attorney, and it was fair and just
(p. 29, Investigation).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">In a situation like this, what could Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> do?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What he
actually did was to enter into a Compromise Agreement under the best terms and
conditions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">possible for his
client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was fully authorized to do
this under the Special Power of Attorney which the defendant (complainant's
mother) executed in his favor.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">A careful <span class="SpellE">scruity</span> (sic) of the Compromise
Agreement reveals that the terms and conditions are not unreasonable or
unconscionable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Compromise Agreement
improves the tight situation of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">defendant,
for whereas before she was under immediate obligation to sell the property in
question, inasmuch as the mortgage with the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
Development Bank has already been discharged and the owner's duplicate of the
title already released.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the
Compromise Agreement all that the defendant was required to do was to return <span class="GramE">all the</span> amount which she received from the plaintiff, plus
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relative to the payment of
interest, the defendant herself had so agreed to pay in her letter to plaintiff
dated </span><st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 12.0pt">January 25, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the Compromise
Agreement, the defendant is not even compelled to pay a down payment of the
obligation upon the signing of the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She is given a period of six (6) months within which to pay the
obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is not compelled to sell
the property for as long as she can pay the obligation within the said period.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The foregoing terms and conditions are fair and just.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are consistent with the antecedent
facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can find no basis for
any charge that defendant's counsel of record has not been faithful to his trust.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">29,
Investigation)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1985</st1:date>
the Solicitor General submitted to the Court the Report and Recommendation
together with the whole record of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1985</st1:date>,
this Court gave the parties herein twenty (20) days from notice to file their
memoranda after which the case would be deemed submitted for decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant in a letter dated <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1985</st1:date> in effect adopted the
documents submitted on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1984</st1:date>
as has memorandum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent did
not submit any memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court after careful consideration of the investigation
conducted by the Solicitor General and taking into account the evidence on
record and recommendation thereon, find that there is in need no basis for the
charge that respondent Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> was unfaithful
to his trust.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the Court
Resolved to DISMISS the complaint for lack of merit.</p>
