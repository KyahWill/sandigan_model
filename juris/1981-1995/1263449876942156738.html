				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">It was the insistence of
counsel for petitioner Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>, against whom a
warrant of arrest had been issued the charge against </span><span style="">him being </span><span style="">that of murder, to recall witnesses for the
prosecution to enable such counsel to </span><span style="">cross-examine them, on, to quote his words,
"<span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> </span><span style="">and amplificatory matters" </span><span style="">and the </span><span style="">denial thereof by respon­dent Municipal Judge Segundo </span><span style="">M. </span><span style="">Garcia of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">that led to
this proceeding for <i>certiorari</i> </span><span style="">and prohibition with preliminary injunction.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> What is prayed for is not only that such
order denying counsel's request to recall government witnesses be set aside and
nullified, but also that bail be granted petitioner, a </span>petition to that
effect having been denied with a subsequent motion for reconsideration still
undecided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents were required to
comment and the Court likewise issued a temporary restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">a
</span>comment was submitted on behalf of respondents by the Solicitor General<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
seeking the dismissal of the petition on the ground that the right to
cross-examine in a preliminary investigation is not a right granted an accused
and that the exercise of discretion by respondent Judge considering the
evidence of record sufficed to justify denial of the application for bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was then considered submitted for
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">An examination of the
record, as well as the pertinent doctrines, makes evident that the
jurisdictional issue posed arises from the failure to accord petitioner a
hearing on </span>his application for bail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A resolution of that question in the sense of respondent Judge affording
petitioner his day in court is equally decisive of the other issue, whether or
not counsel for petitioner could recall witnesses for the prose­cution for the
purpose of asking <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That he could very well do when they testify
to prove evidence of guilt is strong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the present state of the law, it cannot be said that the right to
cross-examine is guaranteed an accused at the stage of preliminary
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is, in the light of
the above, merit in the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the continuation of
the hearing on the prelimi­nary investigation conducted by respondent Judge,
held after he denied the petition for bail, counsel for petitioner asked the
categorical question whether in the opinion of the court "the evidence of
guilt is strong, final and irreversible."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Judge categorically answered:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"That is final, the said order of the Court states that the
evidence of guilt is strong."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
More­over, the order of respondent Judge denying bail explicitly admitted he
issued it on the basis of the motion of petitioner that he be granted such
right and the opposition filed by the First Assistant Provincial Fiscal without
conducting any hearing on such motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, he acted on the mistaken belief that the presentation of
evidence by the prosecution for the purpose of the issuance of the warrant of
arrest, the preliminary examination proper, suffices for the denial of the plea
for bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the latest case on the
subject, People v. <span class="SpellE">Sola</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
decided on March 17, 1981, this Court relying on People v. San Diego,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
nullified an order of a municipal judge named respondent in that case as he
granted bail to the accused without hearing the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present case is much stronger; it is the
accused himself, the explicit beneficiary of the constitutional right, who was
not heard.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is misapprehension
on the part of respondent Judge of the import of the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
as to the summary nature of the hearing required to determine whether bail
should be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opinion of the
then Chief Justice Moran speaks for itself:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"The course of the inquiry may be left to the discretion of the
court which may confine itself to receiving such evidence as has reference to
substantial matters avoiding unnecessary thoroughness in the examination and
cross-examination of witnesses and reducing to a reasonable minimum the amount
of corrobo­ration particularly on details that are not essential to the purpose
of the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Objection has been made
long ago to this method of hearing wherein the regular trial is anticipated
though to a limited extent at least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
the objection was dismissed as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'The second objection is more serious, and, if the courts possessed
entire freedom of action in regard to the matter, would be very
persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The regular trial is, to a
limited extent at least, anticipated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the guilt or innocence of the accused is not to be determined, the
quantity and character of the proofs on this point are, for the special purpose
in hand, necessarily considered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Occasionally much time is thus consumed, and the court's attention is
correspondingly diverted from other business. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>But these objections cannot avail against a
positive constitutional command; if the Constitution requires the court to
determine for itself whether or not the proof is evident or presumption great
in a given case, all considerations of expediency or convenience, however
potent they might be at the common law, must give way."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact, the decision in that case was in favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, with the Fourth Division of the People's Court
being adjudged as having committed a grave abuse of discretion for denying
bail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What cannot be too sufficiently
stressed is that the procedure to be followed in the hearing on an application
for bail, while summary in character, is not to be a mere sham or pretense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must not be an exercise in futility. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The accused is not to be denied his day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That leaves the question
of the alleged grave abuse of discretion in that he refused to allow counsel
for petitioner during the stage of preliminary investigation proper to recall
prosecution witnesses so that counsel could cross-examine them on "<span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> and amplifica­tory matters." As set
forth earlier, the accused is not by law entitled to such a right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leading case is still <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Flordeliza</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1960 decision, with Justice <span class="SpellE">J.B.L</span>. Reyes as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the specific question differs, the principle announced is
applicable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding, it was alleged that there was a grave abuse of discretion by
respondent Justice of the Peace for permitting the cross-examination by the
prosecution of the accused and her witnesses during the preliminary investi­gation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"At the outset, it should be stated that
the refusal of the Justice of the Peace to allow the defense to cross-examine
the prosecution's witnesses pre­sented prior to petitioner's arrest, cannot be
utilized as argument for the contention that the prosecution should not have
been allowed to cross-examine the defense witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An accused is not entitled to cross-examine
the witnesses presented against him in the preliminary investigation before his
arrest, this being a matter that depends on the sound discretion of the Judge
or investigating officer concerned (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ramilo</span>,
98 Phil., 545; <span class="SpellE">Dequito</span> v. Arellano, 81 Phil., 128; <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> v. Lucero, 81 Phil., 640).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner-appellant's attempt to draw a
parallel between the <span class="GramE">refusal</span> of the judge to allow her
to cross-examine prosecution's witnesses, with the permission granted to the
latter as against the defense witnesses, assumes the existence of a vested
right of which petitioner-appellant had been deprived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In being denied confrontation of the
prosecution witnesses, she was not deprived of any right but was merely refused
the exercise of a privilege."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
With the ruling on the question for bail, counsel for petitioner, as above
intimated, would be able to attain the objective which was denied him when he
was not allowed to recall the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To follow the language of <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>,
petitioner as the accused "was not deprived of any right but was merely
refused the exercise of a privilege."</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Abrera</span>
decision likewise stands for this proposition first set forth in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> <span class="SpellE">Dequito</span> case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There are an infinite number of things
which a party may not in strict law do or cause to be done but which may be
permitted by the court in the exercise of its discretion and in the interest of
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Specially</span>
is this true in matters affecting the conduct of the trial and the calling,
recalling and examination of witnesses."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
There is added emphasis as shown by this excerpt:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The judge is not a ministerial officer
reduced to recording what takes place and what witnesses say in the
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Above all, his is the great
responsibility of safeguarding the accused from ground­less or vindictive
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the justice of the peace
is to ascertain, as he must, whether a crime has been committed and, if so,
whether there is probable cause that the accused committed it, his authority
cannot be confined as in a straight jacket to the stiffness of medieval and
outmoded technicalities of practice."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It thus appears clearly that in the exercise of his discretion respondent Judge
could have granted the request and thus avoided the necessity of a petition of
this character having to be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interest of a more
speedy and a more efficient administration of justice would be best served if
there is a greater awareness on the part of judges that in addition to
safeguarding the express rights of an accused person, a matter mandated by the
Constitution or the Rules of Court, they should likewise exercise their
discretion in such a way that the purpose of a preliminary investigation, the
avoidance of groundless or vindictive prosecutions, could be attained in as
fair and objective manner as possible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is counsel for petitioner entirely blameless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the transcript of stenographic notes
submitted by him, there is readily discernible that tone of
"asperity," as noted in the Comment of Solicitor General Mendoza,
when he addressed respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
occupant on the bench, while he should be on guard against undue emotional
reaction, is, after all, not expected to be totally free from such traits as
irritability and exasperation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
he is entitled and should get that proper degree of respect and courtesy from a
lawyer appearing before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is
not only the right of an advocate but his duty to cite all pertinent
authorities, counsel for petitioner could have done so in a less assertive
manner and by way of a submission rather than a lecture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must never be forgotten that a lawyer
pleads; he does not dictate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="">WHEREFORE,</b><span style=""> </span>the writ of <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of respondent Judge
denying bail is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, or
whoever is now the Municipal Judge of Santa Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Marinduque</span>,
must set forthwith the hearing on the appli­cation for bail of petitioner, to
be conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution, the Rules
of Court, and this opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
