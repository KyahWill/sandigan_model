<p class="2Q">"At this juncture, it is opportune to inform you as we had
done so to a number of newly elected local officials the latest of which is
Hon. <span class="SpellE">Gemiliano</span> Lopez of Manila that the
appointment/designation of Building Officials is the sole prerogative of this
Office as a corollary to its power to enforce and administer the National
Building Code (Section 201, P.D. 1096).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Building Officials are the deputies of this Office in the enforcement of
the National Building Code in their respective areas of jurisdiction (Sec. 205,
P.D. 1096).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such capacity, they are
national officials since they exercise a function national in character (OP,
Secretary of Justice No. 44, S. 1979, No. 90, S. 1984).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, designation made by local executive
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>devoid of legal basis.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"We
</span>also wish to inform about the participation of local officials insofar
as the enforcement of the NBC as contained in the Joint Memorandum Circular
dated August 17, 1977, between this Department and the Department of Local
Government, the pertinent part of which reads:</p>

<p class="3Q">'Local executives shall cease to exercise the function of issuing
building permits upon <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the implementing
rules of the Building Code x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q">'They shall assist in the conduct of informational campaign to
secure compliance of the citizens to the code to assure that local building and
structures are maintained in a safe, sanitary and <span class="SpellE">goodworking</span>
condition x <span class="SpellE">x</span> x.'</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the light of the foregoing, it is hoped that you have been
satisfactorily clarified about our request, in view of which, it is
respectfully requested that the subject designation be withdrawn to avoid
confusion and legal complications in the delivery of service on building
matters to your constituents." (pp. 4-5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

positions of Building Officials have not been provided for (Sec. 205, P.D. No. 1096).</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the instant case, the fact that the MMC has provided positions
of Building Officials in its Staffing Pattern with salaries paid out of MMC
funds does not make them <u>local</u> officials because, in the performance of
their functions, they are by specific provision of P.D. No. 1096 <u>subject</u>

<p class="2Q">"In view of the foregoing, we reiterate the view that the

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the Governor of the Metro Manila
Commission, under subparagraph 12 of the LOI, is made responsible for the <u>proper</u>
administration and <u>efficient</u> enforcement of PD 1096 within the Metro
Manila Area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The clear intent is to
deputize the MMC Governor as overall coordinator of the efforts to implement PD
No. 1096 in Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">LOI No. 624 should not be construed as transferring the power of
administration and enforcement of PD No. 1096 within the Metro Manila Area to
the MMC Governor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated previously,
the purpose of said LOI is to implement PD No. 1096 within the Metro Manila
Area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not intended to modify or
supersede certain provisions of said Decree, such as Section 201 thereof which
vests the power of administration and enforcement of the Decree in the Secretary
of Public Works and Highways.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, LOI No. 624 does not have a repealing clause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it expressly acknowledges
the authority of the Secretary of Public Works and Highways under Section 201
by specifically providing in subparagraph 1 thereof that "the Secretary
shall see to it that the PERC be provided with technical supervision and
guidance in the implementation o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">f </span>the
National Building Code in the Metropolitan Manila Area" and that the
Secretary shall "detail with PERC an overall MMA Building Official who
shall be responsible for processing the plans and specifications of building
and structure of metro significance and for the recommending to the Executive
Secretary the issuance of building/structure clearance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall direct the NHA, CAA, MWSS, NPCC and
other agencies under it, as may be necessary to assign required personnel to
coordinate with PERC" (<span class="SpellE">subpar</span>. 1, par. 1; pp.
24-25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a corollary to his power to enforce <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">and </span>administer PD 1096, the power to appoint Building Officials
for the Metro Manila Area must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">also </span>be
vested solely in the Secretary of Public Works and Highways.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the MMC has provided positions
of Building Officials in its Staffing Pattern with salaries paid out of MMC
funds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">does </span>not
make them local officials because in the performance of their functions, they
are by specific provisions of PD 1096 subject to the supervision and control of
the national authority, in this case, the Secretary of Public Works and
Highways.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated in Opinion No. 140, S. 1987 of the Department
of Justice, the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the
National Building Code is the primary concern of the national government, the
said function being vested in the Secretary of Public Works and Highways, (Sec.
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">201, Code), </span>a national
official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since a building official
assigned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to a </span>province, city or
municipality is the deputy of the Secretary of Public Works and Highways in the
enforcement of the provisions of the National Building Code, he is deemed to be
a national official notwithstanding that his salary is paid out of local funds.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, We adopt the opinion of Sec. Ordonez
(earlier quoted) that the authority to administer and enforce the provisions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the
National Building Code, and the power to appoint Building Officials throughout
the country, including Metro Manila, pertain to the Secretary of Public Works
