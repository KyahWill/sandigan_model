Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was docketed as
Criminal Case No. 225.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arraignment
and trial of the case was set for </span><st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, but upon motions of the accused, the same
was reset for several times, the last of which was for </span><st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="9"><span style="">September

his disqualification, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ORDER</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before this Court is a telegraphic motion of the Attorney for
the accused herein, praying for the disqualification of the Presiding Judge of
this Court on the ground that accused <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Lim had
filed a complaint against him with the Department of Justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Presiding Judge of this Court has not, up to the present,
been officially notified of any such complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither had said Attorney apprised him of same previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be safely assumed, therefore, that
said complaint was filed after the institution of the above-entitled case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The filing of a complaint against a judge is not one of the
grounds for disqualification under Section 1 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it could be made a ground under the
second paragraph thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If said complaint had been filed prior to the institution of
the above-entitled case, this Court could, perhaps, inhibit himself from trying
and deciding this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to do so in
a case where same was filed subsequently, would set a dangerous precedent
whereby a litigant could obstruct the administration of justice by filing
complaints, however frivolous, against any judge from whom he could not be
assured of a favorable judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a matter of fact, the filing of complaints of this nature
would rather be regarded as intended to obstruct, impede and degrade the
administration of justice and/or embarrass, harass or intimidate the Presiding
Judge, unless the contrary is proven.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, said telegraphic motion is hereby denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="9"><span style="">September
 7, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Lim filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> a petition for prohibition with preliminary
injunction against Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>, in his official
capacity as Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Balabac</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Palawan</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, praying that the judge be ordered to desist
from trying Criminal Case No. 225.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1966" day="7" month="9"><span style="">September
 7, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> issued a writ of
preliminary injunction after Lim had posted a bond to answer for whatever
damages the judge may sustain by reason of the issuance of said writ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On September 12, 1966,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>, through the Provincial Fiscal, filed a
motion with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>
praying for the dismissal of the petition for prohibition on the grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>(1) that the petition did not state a
sufficient cause of action; (2) that the petition is not the proper remedy; and
(3) that the petition is premature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the scheduled hearing of the motion to dismiss, neither the petitioner nor his
counsel appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1966</st1:date>, the court issued
an order dismissing the petition for prohibition and holding petitioner's cash
bond answerable for whatever damages the respondent may claim, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"ORDER</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finding the motion to dismiss filed by the Provincial Fiscal,
for the reasons stated therein to be meritorious and well-taken, the same is
hereby granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above-entitled case is hereby dismissed, costs against
the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cash bond posted by the

under Official Receipt No. J-9491268 dated <st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1966</st1:date> is hereby held to answer for whatever
damages the respondent may claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED<span class="GramE">. "</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the above-quoted
order, Lim appealed to this Court raising </span>the following issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) whether or not the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Palawan</span></span><span style=""> erred in dismissing the petition for
prohibition; and (2) whether </span>or not said court erred in holding
petitioner's cash bond answerable for <span style="">whatever
damages the respondent judge may claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 2, Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 2.</span> <span class="GramE">PETITION
FOR PROHIBITION.</span> - When the proceedings of any tribunal, corporation,
board, or person, whether exercising functions judicial or ministerial are
without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of
discretion, and there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law, a person aggrieved thereby may file a
verified petition in the proper court alleging the facts with certainty a<span style="">nd praying </span>that judgment be rendered
commanding the defendant to desist from further proceeding in the action or
matter specified therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of
the judgment or order subject thereof, together with copies of all pleadings
and documents relevant and pertinent thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing that two requisites must concur in
order that prohibition may lie to restrain the respondent judge from proceeding
with Criminal Case No. 225, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
that he gravely abused his discretion in denying the telegraphic motion for
disqualification; and (2) that there is no appeal or any other plain, speedy,
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law against said order of
denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of these two requisites
is present in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>
correctly dismissed the petition for prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ground relied upon by petitioner-appellant Lim in seeking the
disqualification of Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> to try the criminal
case <span style="">was </span>the alleged filing by
the former against the latter of an administrative case with the then
Department of Justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that an administrative case had indeed
been filed by Lim against Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>, the same
could not by itself constitute a ground for the disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 1.</span> <span class="GramE">DISQUALIFICATION
OF JUDGES.</span> <span style="">? </span>No
judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which he, or his wife or
child, is <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> interested as heir, legatee,
creditor or otherwise, or in which <span style="">he
is </span>related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or
affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the
rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor, administrator,
guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any inferior court
where his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without the written
consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon the record.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A judge may, in the exercise of his sound discretion,
disqualify himself from sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than
those mentioned above."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first paragraph of the above-quoted provision enumerates the
five grounds which <u>per</u> <u>se</u> disqualify a judge or judicial officer
from sitting in a case, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) when
he or his wife or child is <span class="SpellE">pecuniarily</span> interested as
heir, legatee, creditor or otherwise; (2) when he is related to either party
within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity, computed according to the
rules of civil law; (3) when he is related to counsel within the fourth degree
of consanguinity or affinity, computed according to the rules of civil law; (4)
when he has been executor, administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel; and (5)
when he has presided in any inferior court where his ruling or decision is the
subject of review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Present any of said
grounds, the judge or judicial officer has to disqualify himself from sitting
in the case unless a written consent is signed by all the parties in interest
and entered upon the record.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, the ground relied upon by Lim in seeking the
disqualification of Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>, i.e., the filing
by the former against the latter of an administrative case, is not one of the
five enu­merated grounds which disqualify a judge from sitting in a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>
was under no legal compulsion to disqualify himself from sitting in Criminal
Case No. 225.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the filing by an accused of an administrative
complaint against Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> should be considered
as a "just or valid reason" for him to disqualify himself from trying
and deciding the criminal case under the second paragraph of Sec. 1, Rule 137
of the Rules of Court, would depend on the "exercise of his sound discretion".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his order of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1968</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>
ruled in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lim assails this
ruling as a grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
<span class="GramE">We</span> concur with the following observation of Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> in his assailed order:</p>

<blockquote>"If said complaint had been filed prior to the institution of
the above-entitled case, this Court could, perhaps, inhibit himself from trying
and deciding this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to do so in
a case where same was filed subsequently, <u>would set </u><u><span style="">a </span>dangerous precedent whereby a
litigant could obstruct the administration </u><u><span style="">of justice </span>by filing complaints, however frivolous, against any
judge from whom he could not be assured a favorable judgment</u>"
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Indeed, a contrary ruling would be
fraught with dangerous implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
to grant the same could be taken to mean that the mere filing by a party in a
case of <u>ANY</u> administrative complaint against the judge pre­siding in the
case constitutes "just or valid reason" for said judge to disqualify
himself from trying and deciding the said case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such a case the wheels of justice will come to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the fact that Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span>
did not commit a grave abuse of discretion in refusing to disqualify <span class="GramE">himself</span>, Lim was not entitled to the remedy of prohibition
because of Sec. 2, Rule 137 of the Rules of Court which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 2.</span> OBJECTION THAT JUDGE DISQUALIFIED,
HOW MADE AND EFFECT. - If it be claimed that an official is disqualified from
sitting as <span style="">above </span>pro<span style="">vided, the party objecting to his competency
may, </span>in writing, file with the official his objection, stating the
ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and the official shall thereupon <span style="">proceed with the trial, or withdraw <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, in accordance with his determination of the
question of his disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
decision shall be forthwith made in writing and filed with the other papers in
the case, but <u>no appeal or stay shall be allowed from, or by reason of, his
decision in favor of his own competency, until after final judgment in the
case.”</u> (Underscoring supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the brief filed for
the respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by then Solicitor General and
Assistant Solicitor General, now Associate Justices of this Court, Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> P. de
Castro, respectively, Solicitor Federico V. <span class="SpellE">Sian</span>,
Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alviar</span>
and Atty. Romeo J. <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> (private counsel of
respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>), the case of "<span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party v. Vera" (85 Phil. 126, 128) was
cited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was there ruled that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under this provision, the party seeking the disqualification
of a judge or a judicial officer must, in writing, file with said official his
objection, stating the grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, and if the
objection is denied, the remedy is an appeal to be taken after final judgment
is rendered in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, the petition for prohibition is improper."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In the
more recent case of "<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gopengco</span>" (G. R. No.</span></span><span style=""> L-23710, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1969</span></st1:date><span style="">, 29 SCRA 688), this Court, through Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> Where, however, it is the accused in </span>a
criminal case who seeks the disqualification of the trial judge, the general
restriction provided in the rule against appeal or stay of the proceedings when
the judge denies the motion and rules in favor of his own competency would
apply, as it does in civil cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such case, the accused, in the event of his conviction, could raise the
correctness of the judge's ruling on his non-disqualification with his appeal
from the decision on the merits; and were he to be acquitted, he would have no
cause for complaint against the Judge's acquittal verdict and ruling of
non-disqualification of himself from trying the case and rendering such
verdict."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding no error in the dismissal of the petition for
prohibition, the only issue left for resolution concerns that portion of the
assailed order which held that the cash bond posted by Lim shall be answerable
for whatever damages Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> may claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> was made respondent in
the special civil action for prohibition in his official capacity as judge of
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balabac</span></span><span style=""> and not as a</span> <span style="">private person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
any</span> damage or expense incurred by him in connection with the case <span style="">would </span>be official <span style="">in </span>nature and for <span style="">which </span>no fund of private origin has to
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, such portion of the
appealed <span style="">order </span>which held the
cash bond posted by <span style="">Lim answerable for </span>whatever
damages Judge <span class="SpellE">Callejo</span> <span style="">may claim </span>should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends that the petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from claiming <span style="">not </span>that the
former is not entitled to damages from the bond because the latter had
deposited the same with full knowledge that it would be made to answer for
whatever damages the judge may suffer by reason of a wrongful issuance of the
writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
contention is untenable since the posting of said bond should not have been
ordered <span style="">in </span>the
first place, as no private person would be prejudiced by the preliminary
injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the order appealed from is hereby affirmed
insofar as it dismissed the petition for prohibition but is reversed <span style="">insofar as </span>it held the cash bond
posted by the petitioner answerable for whatever damages the respondent judge
may claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
