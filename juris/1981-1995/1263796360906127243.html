<p class="BODY">The factual and legal background of this case is related most
comprehensively in the Comment filed by the Solicitor General as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Private respondent Airborne Security Service, Inc. is a
security agency, duly licensed and registered under Rep. Act 5487, providing
security guards for fee or compensation to its clientele to protect the
properties and persons of the officials and employees of said clientele.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among its officers are Mr. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Peregrin</span> as director of operations, and Mr. Pedro Solis as
president.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its office is located at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>

<blockquote>Among the employees of the above-named security agency is herein
petitioner Pedro B. <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> of San Andres <span class="SpellE">Bukid</span>, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was employed in the said security agency thrice:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the first in 1973 to 1976; the second in 1977
to 1978; and the third from November 1980 until he received on <st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1982">July 16, 1982</st1:date> the Memorandum from his
employer, which he considered as a letter of his dismissal from
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During his latest period of
employment with the respondent security agency, he was assigned as
security-in-charge detailed at the Union Glass and Container Corporation
(UGCC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His latest position was security
officer and was paid a monthly compensation of P 1,200.00 which included
allowances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1982">July 14, 1982</st1:date>,
respondent security agency received a communication from the personnel manager
of its client, the Union Glass and Container Corporation, asking for the relief
of its security-in-charge <span class="SpellE">Narag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following day, July 15, 1982, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Peregrin</span> of the security agency and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galita</span> of the UGCC came to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">see </span><span class="SpellE">Narag</span> to confront him about the
incident mentioned in the memorandum of relief sent by the personnel manager of
UGCC to the said security agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides giving to the above-named officials his letter of
explanation, <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> narrated the story regarding the
incident, thus --</blockquote>

the name of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span> visited the company, she was
looking for her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because my
guards were busy in their posts, what they did was to call the supervisor of
the husband of <span class="SpellE">Mrs.Edar</span> informing him that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Edar</span>

</span>After a lapse of about thirty (30) minutes my guard by the name of
Alexander <span class="SpellE">Okol</span>, my shift-in-charge, again called the
supervisor of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span> in order that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span> could meet his wife at the gate, then the supervisor
answered my security guard to wait for a few minutes and they will locate for
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After about thirty (30) minutes Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span> went
to the gate and all of a sudden he shouted and accused the security guards why
they did not call him earlier and because I was there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I explained to him that we informed his
supervisor for no less than two (2) times, but Mr. <span class="SpellE">Edar</span>
did not listen to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">my </span>explanation
and what he did was to go to Mr. Pineda and then after a few minutes Mr. Pineda
called me up by phone wanting to talk to me and when I got hold of the phone,
Mr. Pineda shouted at me and was accusing me of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

everything in behalf of the employees there.' <span class="GramE">(pp. 42-43, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 24, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Security Services, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked why,
the two officials did not bother to answer him (p. 44, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

<blockquote>Acting on the request of the personnel manager of the UGCC,
respondent security agency coursed a Memorandum on <st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1982">July 16, 1982</st1:date> to <span class="SpellE">Narag</span>, which
the latter received at its central office on the same day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The entire text of said Memorandum reads as

complainant <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> asked for his salary from the
accounting department of the security agency but the people there informed him that
he has no salary to receive because his services were already terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of this information, complainant <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> approached Mr. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Peregrin</span>,
director of operations of the said security agency, and asked him why he has no
salary for the period from <st1:date month="7" day="16" year="1982">July 16 to

Relations Commission, National Capital Region, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
against his employer, Airborne Security Services, Inc., for illegal dismissal,
non-payment of legal holiday pay, violations of PD Nos. 525, 851 and 1123; and
for reimbursement of cash deposits (see Annex 'A', Petition).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On October 10, 1982, respondent security agency through Mr. Jaime
N. <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>, vice-president for administration and
finance, filed its Position paper, claiming that complainant <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> was duly paid of all his benefits and other
remuneration as provided for under existing laws and regulations, and that it
is not true that said complainant was illegally dismissed but that he 'was
merely requested to be relieved and that he has to wait for a vacancy
responsive (sic) to his rank' (see records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise, complainant <span class="SpellE">Narag</span> through
counsel filed his Position Paper on <st1:date month="10" day="18" year="1982">October
 18, 1982</st1:date>, reiterating that he was 'effectively dismissed without
any cause whatsoever' (see records).</blockquote>

while Messrs. Enrique <span class="SpellE">Peregrin</span> and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span> and Cornelio <span class="SpellE">Alpuerto</span>
testified as witnesses for respondent security agency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1984">April 17, 1984</st1:date>,
Labor Arbiter Valenzuela promulgated the decision in this labor case, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREFORE, we find that complainant Pedro B. <span class="SpellE">Narag</span>
was constructively dismissed without a valid cause for which respondent
Airborne Security Services, Inc., through its responsible officials, should be,
as it is hereby, ordered to reinstate him to his former position, and pay him
one (1) year <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, the least amount amenable to
complainant which he conveyed to respondent's counsel and representative when
undersigned made a last ditch effort to settle the same before promulgation of
this Decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="GramE">complaint
for the payment of legal holiday pay, <span class="SpellE">Ecola</span>, 13th

aforementioned decision of the labor arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And, on May 11, 1984, respondent security agency filed its aforesaid
'Partial Appeal' from the decision of the labor arbiter to the respondent
Commission, claiming in the main that complainant <span class="SpellE">Narag</span>
was only placed under <span class="SpellE">headquarter's</span> disposition on
July 16, 1982; he was never dismissed from the service of respondent security
agency (see records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On December 27, 1984, respondent Commission, Third Division, <u>en</u>

but was merely directed to present himself to the security agency's central
office for instruction and/or assignments, but he opted not to work during the
period from July 16, to 31, 1982; hence, he should be, as it was so ordered, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reinstated </span>to his former position but
without any <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (see Annex 'C', Petition).</blockquote>

this Court categorically held that the shortened period of ten (10) days fixed

that the law has commanded that labor cases be promptly, if not peremptorily

to be done by the contending parties can be taken advantage of more by
management than by labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Most labor
claims are decided in their favor and management is generally the
