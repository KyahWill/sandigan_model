HONORABLE TEODULO C. TANDAYAG, AS JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF LANAO DEL NORTE, BRANCH IV, STATIONED AT ILIGAN CITY, AND CONSOLATRIX KHO SY, IN HER OWN BEHALF AND
IN BEHALF OF HER MINOR SON, EDGARDO SY TIONGSA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This appeal from an order of the lower court poses the question
of whether or not the repatriation of a mother, <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, entitles her minor
son, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiongsa</span>, to a declaration that he is entitled to Philippine
citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an amended petition for
repatriation, the prayer was from an order from the lower court "1 -
authorizing petitioner's son, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiongsa</span>, to take his oath of
allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines, at such time and place as may be
set forth in the judgment; and thereafter 2 - an order issue directing the
Commissioner, Bureau of Immigration, Manila or his representative, to revoke,
cancel or void the Alien Certificate of Registration and Immigration
Certificate of Residence of petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and her minor child, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiongsa</span>,
* * *."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Such prayer was granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was a
motion for reconsideration based on alleged procedural deficiencies arising
from lack of conformity to the then applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the Department of Justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In an order denying such motion, the lower court pointed out that there
was no sufficient basis for the imputation of such procedural flaws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, relying on <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the lower court affirmed its order "declaring <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and her minor son, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiongsa</span>,
citizens of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
by repatriation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the appeal to this Court, it was even pointed out that repatriation, on the
assumption of the mother being a Filipino citizen prior to her marriage, may be
obtained "by the simple expedient of taking the required oath of
allegiance and its filing with the proper civil registry (Sec. 4, Com. Act No.
63, as amended), without need of resorting to judicial proceedings."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Nonetheless, in the five-page brief submitted by the Office of the Solicitor
General, it was alleged that the lower court erred in ruling that the mother
was repatriated and that the minor son by virtue thereof was entitled to
acquire Filipino citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be
noted that less than two pages were devoted to discussing the two assigned
errors. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Nor was any effort made to
refute the doctrine set forth in <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, the case relied upon by the lower court Judge in
granting the petition for repatriation of the mother and the declaration of
citizenship of the minor son.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal
lacks merit.<span style="font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the well-reasoned order denying the motion for reconsideration
by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Tandayag</span>,
the argument that there was "no satisfactory evidence" presented by
the mother to support her claim for citizenship was rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "This contention could not be
sustained because <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> has proven in open Court that she was born in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City on September 7, 1921 of a Filipino father who
is already dead and a Filipino mother who is still alive so that she is a
natural born citizen of the Philip­pines; that she was employed as a public
school teacher in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> before the war and after the
war and her claim for <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> was duly approved and
fully redeemed as shown by <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "J",
"J-1" and "J-2"; that she was a registered voter of Precinct
No. 6, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>, in the 1946 elections as shown by the
certification, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "K" and
"K-11"; that all her sisters and brothers are Filipino citizens as
shown by the fact that her sister, Lourdes E. <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, is
a licensed pharmacist, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "L", and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Kho</span>, also a licensed
pharmacist, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "M".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span>
<span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, has, there­fore,
satisfactorily proven that she was a Filipino citizen by birth and continued to
be such until her marriage to her Chinese husband on November 15, 1947, and
that she has not taken any oath of allegiance to any foreign state, country or
sovereign."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In addition, the City Fiscal, during such hearing, verbally urged respondent
Judge to deny the repatriation on the ground that he should wait until he
became of age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor was such submission
found acceptable in view of the ruling in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> decision
which in the language of the lower court held "that Alejandro D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> became a Filipino citizen at least upon his father's
death."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Here the mother reacquired Filipino citizenship upon the death of her husband.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, the appeal lacks merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reliance on <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
by the lower court is more than justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the election of respondent <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> to
the office of municipal mayor of <span class="SpellE">Manticao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, was challenged in a <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> petition on the ground of lack of
eligibility, he being a Chinese national.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lower court found the petition well-founded but the Supreme Court
reversed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>,
speaking for the Court, first noted that the facts were undisputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was
the son of a Chinese national, <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span class="SpellE">Piangco</span>,
and a Filipino mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was born in <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lanao</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
in 1912.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had never been to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
had voted in previous elections and had held such offices as inspector of the
Bureau of Plant Industry, a public school teacher, a filing clerk, and acting
municipal treasurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as noted
by Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> in his opinion:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"These facts also appear <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> in evidence:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of the respondent's brothers, Pedro D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
before the war and up to this time has been occupying the position of income
tax examiner of the Bureau of Internal Revenue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His other brother, Jose D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, is a practicing
certified public accountant, and before the war was the accountant of the
National Abaca and Fiber Corporation (NAFCO).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His other brother, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, is a <span class="SpellE">practising</span> physician,
and, before the war, <span class="GramE">was</span> charity physician in <span class="SpellE">Initao</span> and later a physician in the provincial
hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the war, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was a captain in the Philippine Army.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His younger brother was a lieutenant in the
120th Infantry Regiment of the guerrillas."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
It would appear, therefore, that the lower court was more than justified in
holding that the mother, <span class="SpellE">Consolatrix</span> <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>, who was born in 1921,
thereafter employed as a public school teacher before and after World War II,
with her claim for <span class="SpellE">backpay</span> duly approved, was a
registered voter and whose brothers and sisters are recognized as Filipino
citizens, is entitled to the same ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence upon the death of her husband, her right to repatriation cannot be
doubted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This portion of the opinion of
Justice <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> is likewise relevant:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Certainly, it would neither be fair nor
good policy to hold the respondent an alien after he had exercise the
privileges of citizenship and the Government had confirmed his Philippine
citizenship on the faith of legal principles that had the force of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions the Secretary of Justice
had declared as Filipino citizens persons similarly circumstanced as the herein
respondent."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Similarly, again as held in <span class="SpellE">Talaroc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tiongsa</span>, her son, who was a minor having born in 1952
and the father having died in 1957, is entitled to Philippine citizenship.</p>
