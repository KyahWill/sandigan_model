<p class="BODY">On 5 May 1976, a criminal complaint was filed by the Station
Commander with the Municipal Court of Magsaysay, Davao del Sur against the
accused Zosimo Crisologo alias "Amang", a deaf-mute, for robbery and
homicide alleged to have been committed on 1 May 1976 between ten to eleven
o'clock in the evening in Calamagoy, Poblacion Magsaysay, Davao del Sur.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 December 1977, arraignment was set.  The accused was allegedly informed of the
charge against him through <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sign

14.0pt">objection of counsel, however, this plea was disregarded and
arraignment was re-scheduled until such time as the Court could avail of the
services of an expert in the sign language from the school of the deaf and
dumb.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">On
26 </span>June 1979 the Court through another presiding judge, upon insistent
plea of defense counsel for a sign language expert to assist the accused, again
reset arraign­ment as no expert in sign language was available.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">School for the Deaf </span>and Dumb in Pasay City
was sent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>copy of the court

to die by electrocution.  Executive
clemency was recommended, however, in view of the accused's infirmity and his
nearly ten-year detention as a suspect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the accused and the Solicitor-General now ask for the
reversal of the judgment of conviction due to the failure of the trial court to
safeguard the accused's right to due process of law and the insufficiency of
the purely circumstantial evidence presented to overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence in favor of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find their position to be well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of an interpreter in sign language who could have
conveyed to the accused, a deaf-mute, the full facts of the offense with which
he was charged and who could <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">also have
communicated the accused's own version of the circumstances which led to his
implication in the crime, deprived the accused of a full and fair trial and a
reasonable opportunity to defend himself.  Not even the accused's final plea of not guilty can excuse these
inherently unjust circumstances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of a qualified interpreter in sign language and of
any other means, whether in writing or otherwise, to inform the accused of the
charges against him denied the accused his fundamental right to due process of

The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accuracy and fairness of the
factual process by which the guilt or innocence of the accused was determined
was not safeguarded.  The accused could
not be said to have enjoyed the right to be heard by himself and counsel, and to
be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in the proceedings where his life and

it needs no discussion in deciding that all this must be done in a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">manner

accused.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Mere </span>confrontation of the witnesses would be useless, bordering
upon the farcical, if the accused could not hear or understand their
testimony.  So, also, as to the nature
and cause of the accusation.  In the
absence of an interpreter it would be a physical impossibility for the accused,
a deaf-mute, to know or to understand the nature and cause of the accusation
against him, and, as here, he could only stand by helplessly, take his
medicine, or whatever may be coming to him, without knowing or understanding, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and all </span>this in the teeth of the

<p class="BODY">The basic constitutional infirmity alone in the conduct of the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Aside from </span>the
unfair setting and circumstance in which the accused was convicted,
insufficiency of evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to warrant </span>a

the conviction.  The following events
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">circumstances </span>are relevant <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>this regard:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 May 1976, at past eight o'clock in the evening, the accused
and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">deceased were </span>last seen
walking away together from a <u>sari-sari</u> store where they had been
drinking <u>tuba</u> steadily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>apparent
harmony.  At around eleven thirty of the
same evening, the, accused suddenly appeared in the house of Wilson
Evangelista, who was then with relatives butchering a pig for the baptism of his
child the following day.  The accused
was panting and trembling, and told Wilson Evangelista in sign language that he
had come from Calamagoy, at the side of the canal, where there were persons
fighting on the road.  Evangelista later
testified that he noticed the accused wearing a fatigue shirt with a blood­stain
on it, and carrying a flashlight.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On 2 May 1976, Patrolman
Reynaldo Pinto, Jr., was told to investigate a case of robbery with homicide
with the de</span>ceased Martin Francisco as victim, and to arrest the accused
on the basis of Wilson Evangelista's statement that he saw the accused with a
bloodstained shirt the previous evening when the crime could conceivably have
occurred.  Patrolman Pinto did so that
very day.  Several days later, he was
also able to recover the deceased's wristwatch and flashlight from the house
the accused's father allegedly through the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">assistance of the accused himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being asked who killed the deceased, the accused allegedly
admitted to Pat. Pinto in sign language that it was he by making gestures which
Pat. Pinto interpreted to mean that the accused had been stoned by the
deceased, thus impelling the accused to stab the latter.  This confession, however, was not included
in Pat. Pinto's affidavit as he allegedly forgot to tell the investigator.  He also acknow­ledge his failure to notify
the accused of his right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">coun</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sel before interrogation and investigation
due to difficulty in conveying the matter by sign language.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Based on the above
circumstances and evidence, the trial court found the accused guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime charged, reasoning as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution proved and which this Court finds that <u>the
accused was the last person to be seen with the deceased</u>, and that he was
drunk when he left the store of prosecution witness Salome del Socorro together
with the deceased.  The Court also finds
that <u>the accused's clothes had blood­stain on it</u> when he went to the
house of prosecu­tion witness Wilson Evangelista at 11:30 in the evening of May
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1, </span>1976, the night when the de­ceased
was robbed and killed.  The seiko 5
actus wrist watch and the flashlight colored red and white both belonging to
the deceased Martin Francisco were recovered from the possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>the accused and which recovery was
done <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">with </span>his help.  The unexplained possession by the accused of
the properties belonging to the deceased <u>proved</u> that he took these
things unlawfully.  The fifteen (15)
stab wounds which were inflicted on the deceased, many of which were fatal
wounds <u>proved that a much younger [man] than the deceased could have
inflicted the same</u>.  In the case at
bar, the accused is very much younger than the deceased who was 63 years old at
the time of his death, xxx frail and without physical attributes, unlike the
accused who looks hastily, robust and young xxx.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that Pat. Pinto and his companion were able to get
a statement from the accused without telling him in advance of his
constitutional rights, due to difficulty in ex­plaining them in sign language,
the accused's statement by sign language was coupled with his voluntary help in
recovering the things belonging to the deceased.  Furthermore, the court consi­dered and took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">note of </span>the plea of guilty <u>which
was entered into by the accused on his first arraignment by sign language
through Mr. Alejandro Munoz who is an associate of the accused in their younger
days.</u>" (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find </span>the trial
court's decision essentially lacking in that degree of certainty in reason and conscience

certainty of guilt.  Absolute certainty

[go] unpunished."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such standards, we believe, have not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">been </span>met in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman Pinto, the interrogator to whom the accused allegedly
confessed the details which led to a presumption that he killed the deceased,
expressly admitted that he could have misinterpreted the gestures made by the
accused as he had only a slight knowledge of sign language.  Further­more, the same witness did not give
fully credible replies when questioned about the possibility that he was
ordered to proceed to the house of accused's father to get the incrimi­nating
watch and flashlight which were delivered there ear­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">lier by </span>a certain Nicolas.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bloodstain on the accused's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">shirt </span>could conceivably have come also from the fighting that the
accused told Wilson Evangelista he had witnessed.  Considering that the deceased sustained fifteen (15) stab wounds,
twelve (12) of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which </span>could have
separately caused death, according to the medical officer who examined the body
of the deceased, the presence of a single bloodstain on the front of accused's
shirt hardly supports the conclusion reached by the trial court, especially,
when related to the high degree of intoxication appreciated against the
accused.  As testified to by the medical
officer who, as stated, examined the body of the deceased, the stab wounds
could also have been inflicted by several assailants using different
weapons.  That the accused looked much
more robust than the deceased and thus could have committed the crime does not
by itself deserve the weight and consideration that the trial court gave to
it.  Furthermore, the rubber slippers
and eyeglasses found near the scene of the crime were never identified or explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's appreciation of the plea of guilty earlier
entered for the accused by Special Policeman Alejandro Munoz, which the first
presiding judge earlier discarded, is regrettable, to say the least, especially
when considered with the admittedly limited knowledge in sign language on the
part of Pat. Munoz and in relation to the investigator's own admission that the
accused was never informed of his right to counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
