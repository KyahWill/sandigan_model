Alfonso, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows that:</p>

in the evening of <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1980</st1:date>,
the accused <span class="SpellE">Cristito</span> <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(appellant herein) was at the guardhouse located inside the compound of the
Magnolia Poultry and Dairy Farm at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Amayong</span>,
Alfonso, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was at that time the Officer-in-Charge of

<blockquote>While the said accused was at the guardhouse, Roberto Miranda, a
driver of the Poultry and Dairy Farm of San Miguel Corporation arrived driving
a company wagon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>, another security guard, <span class="SpellE">openned</span>
the gate and allowed Miranda to enter the company's compound (pp. 9-10, TSN, <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1983</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, accused and Roberto Miranda were
seen exchanging fist blows (p. 36, TSN, January 26, 1982).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Security Guard <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>
and a farm supervisor of the Poultry Farm by the name of Ronnie <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span> tried to pacify and separate the two protagonists
with <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span> holding Miranda while <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>
holding the accused (pp. 38-44, TSN, ibid).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> then brought accused <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to the guardhouse (pp. 45-46, TSN, ibid) while <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span>
brought Miranda down the guardhouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> was getting the trip ticket
of Miranda, accused <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
took a shotgun near the guardhouse (pp. 51, TSN, ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went down the guardhouse where Miranda was
and fired at the latter (pp. 52-53, TSN, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a result, Miranda was fatally hit and died (p. 60, TSN,
ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Japlo</span>
who was very near Miranda ran away towards the grassy portion (p. 62, TSN,
ibid).</blockquote>

shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Policeman <span class="SpellE">Abayante</span>
of Alfonso, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>

testified on what transpired between him and the accused when he arrived at the
scene of the shooting incident.<span style="">&nbsp;

 9, 1981</st1:date>).</blockquote>

accidentally fired while he and the victim were grappling for the possession <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following
in brief is his version:</blockquote>

<blockquote>As OIC of the Sentinel Security Agency assigned at the Poultry and
Dairy Farm of San Miguel Corporation, he was at the guardhouse of the Poultry
and Dairy Farm of San Miguel Corporation when the deceased, as driver of the
said farm, arrived in a company wagon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His co-guard, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>,
opened the gate for the deceased who entered the company's premises and stopped
at the guardhouse where he alighted and went near the accused who was then
situated at the guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Approaching
the accused, Roberto Miranda (now deceased) shouted to him saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Supladong</span>
OIC, <span class="SpellE">bagay</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">iyo</span> <span class="SpellE">patayin</span>," after which
the deceased suddenly grabbed the service shotgun of the accused, and they
grappled for the possession of the firearm for 20 seconds with the deceased
holding the muzzle of the gun and the handle, after which the gun went
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the gun went off, the deceased
fell on the ground, more or less ten meters away from the guardhouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon request of the accused to his supervisor, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tonja</span>, Police Officers <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Mojica</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aviñante</span> came about <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening, and he voluntarily surrendered himself and
his service firearm to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Silvino</span> <span class="SpellE">Aviñante</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused claims that he was not investigated at the Alfonso Police
Headquarters but instead was brought to the 212 PC Company at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tagaytay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was detained and investigated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He presented in evidence a Guard Report prepared by <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> in his own handwriting stating that he saw
the deceased and the accused grappling for the firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw the deceased trying to grapple for the
possession of the gun from the accused and, after a while, the gun fired and he
saw the deceased fell (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 1-B, 1-C).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, the accused presented in evidence a portion of a
written statement of <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> given at about 10:00
o'clock of June 28, 1980 before Investigator Dante Moral wherein he stated,
among others, that he was with the accused at the gate of San Miguel Poultry
Farm when Roberto Miranda arrived and after opening the gate for him and
alighting from the pick-up that he was driving, the accused uttered some words
directed to the deceased, after which they wrestled with each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told them to stop and tried to pacify them
when he heard a gunshot, after which he saw the deceased lying face down. </blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, the accused likewise presented Tito <span class="SpellE">Cedeño</span>,
Operation Officer at Sentinel Watchman and Security Agency who claimed to have
received the Guard Report from the security guard <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> and brought it to the Manila Office so that
their investigator can investigate it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit 1)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The other witness for the accused, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Benbenoto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Emelo</span>, testified that sometime on <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1982</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> called him and requested him to pass the message to
the accused that the latter should not be angry with him for having testified

and subsequently, upon the appointment of Judge <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>,
to her <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner now assails the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> court to try the case and to render judgment
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He insists that upon the
abolition of the Circuit Criminal Courts, jurisdiction should have been assumed
by the Regional Trial Court, sitting in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (<span class="SpellE">Trece</span> <span class="SpellE">Martires</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Tagaytay</span> City, or <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> City),
admittedly, the venue where the crime was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court gave due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court assumes that Judge <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, as
Judge of the Criminal Circuit Court, of the seventh judicial district, in <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, took cognizance of CCC-VII-3207 upon the authority
granted by this Court, per its Resolution of May 16, 1972, empowering that
court to try "cases that may be filed [therein] from the province of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> and its three cities, at <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,

The question, however, is whether or not it should have been referred to the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> RTC upon the phasing out of <span class="SpellE">CCCs</span>,
and whether or not the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> RTC had jurisdiction to
try and entertain the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The transfer of cases from the abolished courts to the proper
tribunals is governed by the following provision:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 44.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transitory
provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>--The provisions of this Act
shall be immediately carried out in accordance with an Executive Order to be
issued by the President/Prime Minister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals, the Court of First Instance, the Circuit Criminal
Courts, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Courts, the Courts of Agrarian
Relations, the City Courts, the Municipal Courts and the Municipal Circuit
Courts shall continue to function as presently constituted and organized, until
the completion of the reorganization provided in this Act as declared by the
President/Prime Minister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such
declaration, the said courts shall be deemed automatically abolished and the
incumbents thereof shall cease to hold office.<span style="">&nbsp;

appropriate Courts constituted pursuant to this Act, together with the
pertinent functions, records, equipment, property and the necessary personnel.</blockquote>

necessary from the funds for organizational changes as provided in Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said funding shall thereafter be included in
the annual General<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>Appropriations Act<span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees that after the <span class="SpellE">CCCs</span>
ceased to function, the case should have been coursed to the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> RTC, the (alleged) crime having been committed in
Alfonso, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court finds, however, circumstances that argue against the setting aside of
the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> RTC proceedings for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Lakandula</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court sustained the jurisdiction of the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, although the offense involved took place in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
over which the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> CCC exercised no jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, speaking through Justice <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., held:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> But,
since this case had been transferred, We can only assume, as the Solicitor
General stated, that, in the absence of any other showing in the records, the
transfer of the case to the Circuit Criminal Court was effected in accordance
with the long standing practice followed by judges of moving cases from one
branch to another branch of the same court, if they are agreed that such a step
would best promote the ends of justice, as in this case, which had been pending
for a long time in the Court of First Instance without being heard although the
accused was detained.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no debate that this case has been pending for the
last nine years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court can not indeed
imagine the unsettling consequences, should the same be tried anew, in terms of
the expeditious administration, especially, of criminal justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds that the ends of speedy trial
will be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span> better if the proceedings before
Judge <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> were left alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the records show that the petitioner had pursued
vigorously the case before the lower court, on the supposition that it had
jurisdiction, and had asked it to render a judgment of acquittal, as he in fact
requests this Court to set aside its decision (as well as the decision of the
respondent Court of Appeals).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a
behavior that forces him to accept the jurisdiction of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> court, because if the latter
lacked jurisdiction, it can not act, much less render a decision, whether of a
conviction or acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, he can
not rightfully maintain an attack on the trial court's competence after having
accepted--and invoked--it.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span> is an impediment against any attack.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding against the petitioner, the respondent Court of
Appeals observed:</p>

<blockquote>The defense is correct in pointing out that the finding of the
lower court that the accused shot the victim ten meters away is not supported
by the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a mere
conclusion drawn from the fact that the deceased fell and was found ten meters
away from the guardhouse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What appeared as improbable to the Court is the version of the
accused that he and the deceased were grappling for the possession of the
firearm at the guardhouse when the gun accidentally fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were so, why then did the victim fall
ten meters away from the guardhouse?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>As observed by the court,
there is no iota of evidence adduced by the defense to show that within the
twenty seconds of the alleged grappling for the possession of the firearm, a
distance was traversed by the protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This does not, however, mean that the deceased was shot by the accused
ten meters away from the guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It simply
lends credence to the evidence of the prosecution that after pacifying the
deceased and the accused who was brought to the guardhouse, the accused got
hold of the shotgun and went towards the victim and shot him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This was the declaration of the prosecution witness Ronnie <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span>, the Farm Superintendent, who testified that after
pacifying the protagonists, he took the victim somewhere at the gate while
accused was brought to the guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then saw the accused holding the shotgun going towards him and the
victim Roberto Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he shouted to
Miranda, "run,” while he ran to a grassy place leaving Miranda behind when
he heard the shot from the direction where he left the victim Roberto
Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> likewise confirmed the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified
that appellant took the shotgun and went to Miranda who was down the guardhouse
and fired the shot there (pp. 52-53, <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="1">Jan.
 26, 1982</st1:date>).<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In short, the petitioner was supposed to have returned to the
guardhouse (after engaging the deceased in a fist fight), waited there for the deceased
with a shotgun, and upon sighting him, gunned him down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This contradicts the version of the accused,
that while he admitted having armed himself with a shotgun, the deceased died
as a result of an accidental firing when the latter attempted to wrest the
firearm away from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In discarding the petitioner's story, the respondent Court relied
foremost, on the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>, a co-security guard of the petitioner at the
compound, and Ronnie <span class="SpellE">Japlo</span>, the farm superintendent,
who both testified that the petitioner did have a shotgun with which he shot
the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Appellate Court was
also perplexed why the latter was found lying ten meters away from the
guardhouse, where the petitioner claimed they grappled for possession of the
shotgun, if truly he (the petitioner) shot him while they fought for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact, finally, that the deceased's wound
was classified by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span>,
a medico-legal officer, as one brought about by "near contact fire",
rather than "contact fire", convinced the Court of <span class="SpellE">Apleals</span> that the petitioner shot him while a considerable
distance separated them, which would not have been possible if the two were
indeed grappling for the rifle.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is not convinced that on the strength of these pieces
of evidence, the petitioner is indeed, guilty, whether of murder, as charged,
or of homicide, as found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
finds shreds of evidence in the records that the respondent Court did overlook,
as the petitioner so insists, that would have indeed exculpated him on account
of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court notes that <span class="SpellE">Nemesio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> had previously entered in the guard book report,

<p class="BODY">The above statement was entered by <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>
himself in compliance with company procedure requiring guards to put down
unusual incidents occurring while on duty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> inscribed that as a result
of what he noted on the night in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above written evidence substantiates the petitioner's claim
that he and the deceased were fighting for possession of the shotgun, and while
this does not per se prove that the shooting was accidental, it casts a shadow
of doubt on the prosecution's version that he had deliberately shot the
deceased after waiting for him at the guardhouse, and that he had killed him in
cold blood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the fact that the
evidence for the defense is itself weak (because the petitioner had not shown
that the shooting was accidental) that can not militate against the petitioner
for the simple reason that the prosecution itself has no evidence, to justify a
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily ???e prosecution can
not rely on the infirmity of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> evidence,
but must depend on the strength of its own.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The existence of <span class="SpellE">Matalog's</span> guard book report
was never denied by the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although the latter sought to repudiate it upon <span class="SpellE">Matalog's</span>
own recantation--a recantation the Court of Appeals accepted--this Court finds
that it is too late for any retraction without necessarily making a liar out of
<span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court does not buy, so to speak purely and simply, <span class="SpellE">Matalog's</span>
excuse why he testified otherwise in court (other than what he claimed in the
guard book report), as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Narrating the circumstances surrounding its execution, witness, <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span> testified that the guard report was prepared by him
at the instance and upon the order of the accused-appellant (p. 48, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September 7, 1984).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The said witness was emphatic in saying that accused was the one who
dictated the entry in the report which were all lies (pp. 44-45, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 2, 1982) and because the latter told him that he
(accused-appellant) already killed eight (8) persons (pp. 49-5-, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 2, 1982) he became afraid and was left with no
choice except to follow him (p. 56, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, March 2,
1982).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he did not submit the
said guard report but instead kept it in a cabinet because its contents were
not true (pp. 57-58, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1984</st1:date>)<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We can not, as we said, accept this explanation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, it rests on <span class="SpellE">Matalog's</span>
barren say--so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, we have
difficulty believing that the petitioner had to resort to subtle threats
("I have killed eight persons already") to make him record the
statement in question because the petitioner could have simply trained his
shotgun on him, and succeed with better facility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say that he, anyway, "become
afraid" is to say that the petitioner's threats, idle as they were, were
truly so overpowering to make him, <span class="SpellE">Matalog</span>, put in
his book report a false entry, one involving the death indeed of a fellow
company employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is plainly
incredulous.</p>

<p class="BODY">A <span class="SpellE">recanter's</span> testimony should be
accepted with caution and weighed carefully against the presumption of
innocence the accused enjoys under the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As we stated, <span class="SpellE">Matalog's</span> on-the-spot report
puts a cloud on the case for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a consequence, we can not accept the farm superintendent's, Ronnie <span class="SpellE">Japlo's</span>, testimony that the petitioner did shoot the
deceased deliberately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arrayed against
his testimony is the very report, sustaining the petitioner's story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between his mere assertions and a forthright
written statement, the latter must be made to prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the deceased's cadaver was found lying ten meters
away from the guardhouse can not point to the petitioner's guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, it would have spoken against the
defense's claim that the accused and the deceased were <span class="SpellE"><b>tete-a-tete</b></span>
in a tug-of-war over a rifle in the vicinity of the guardhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence, however, reveals that the
deceased's remains were ten meters away from the guardhouse because the spot
was sloping and in all probability, the deceased had rolled over after the
shotgun had gone off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
deceased died on sloping terrain is not disputed by the parties, the
prosecution, the trial court, the Court of Appeals, or the Solicitor
General.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also substantiated by
Exhibit "M" a photograph submitted to the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals need not <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> have been puzzled why the deceased lay ten meters
from the guardhouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, as we likewise indicated, was of the
opinion that because the deceased's gunshot wounds were brought about by a
"near contact fire", which implies, in the testimony of the
medico-legal officer, a distance of not more than three inches<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a>
between the wound and the muzzle of the firearm, rather than by "contact
fire", which implies, in his opinion, that the muzzle of the firearm had
been touching<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a>
a part of the victim's body, it means that there was no struggle for the
possession of the rifle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is
not persuaded that just because the deceased's injury was not by "contact
fire" no such a struggle could have possibly occurred as claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, what the deceased's wound suggests
(caused by "near contact fire") that the deceased and the accused
were at any rate close to each other (by not more than three inches), and this
does not, in the court's view, foreclose the possibility of a struggle in fact
going on between the two protagonists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that the deceased was shot at close range (though not
necessarily by contact fire), a fact that can not by itself dissipate all
claims that a grappling for the rifle had preceded the shooting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, the Court of Appeals’ recital leaves a
reasonable doubt on this Court's mind that the petitioner had shot the deceased
deliberately, and other than by accident as the latter suggests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the petitioner's story is as
already noted by itself self-serving, that alone can not overcome the presumption
of innocence with which no less than the fundamental law of the land
consecrates accused persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
significant is that the prosecution has shown no sufficient evidence essential
for conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds no necessity in delving further on the fifth,
sixth, and seventh errors the petitioner assigns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are quite convinced that the respondent
Court or Appeals’ above error is sufficient to justify this reversal.</p>
