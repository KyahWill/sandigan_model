motion; and (2) the decision having became final in 1974 and not having been
enforced for almost eight (8) years due to the fault of the private
respondents, it had already become dormant; hence it can no longer be enforced
by a mere motion but requires an independent action pursuant to section 6, Rule

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We, however, agree with
the petitioner that the procedure undertaken by the private respondents
(plaintiffs) in executing the judgment which was condoned by the lower court is
not sanctioned by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When, on the basis of successive new requirements imposed on
them, the private respondents "lost hope" that the petitioner would
ever pay them, they should have filed a motion to declare the petitioner in
default of payment and asked for an alias writ of execution for the enforcement
of the other alternative found in the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision states that after the failure of the petitioner to pay
within one (1) year from receipt of the decision, <u>the</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioner</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

partitioned among them on the ratio of 2 to 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another option which the private respondents could have taken
when the COA issued another new requirement to take steps in titling the
subject parcel of land in the name of the petitioner was to file a motion to
declare such requirement unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must be noted that the judgment only ordered the respondents to
execute a conveyance in favor of the Province of Sorsogon upon payment of the
value of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the problem of
Sorsogon to have the title registered in its name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever feelings they had against the petitioner in relation to
the shabby treatment accorded them by the COA cannot justify the respondents
taking the law into their hands and taking possession of some portions of the
subject parcel of land, much less allowing third persons to occupy the
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the lower court's questioned Order granting the
restraining motion of the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondents,
the end result of which was the execution of the judgment, appears to be
improper and irregular.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At the same time, we
cannot blame the private respondents for their drastic action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly summarized by the lower court:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x a writ of execution was issued on July 21, 1975, upon
motion of plaintiffs, but said writ was returned unsatisfied, although with the
report that the parties had chosen to await the opinion of the Commission on
Audit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even so, the plaintiffs exerted
efforts to comply with the requirements which were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">allowed by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as
it may, </span>additional requirements were imposed one after the other to the
extent of asking for absurd, (sic) i.e., 'to have the corresponding title
issued in the name of the Municipality, free from all liens and encumbrances.'
This was in the later part of 1980, or more than six (6) years after defendant
province's receipt of the decision by which it was ordered to effect payment
within one (1) year only from said receipt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, we have here an instance of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">suitor who, instead of wooing his heartthrob, would rather dictate his
wish to the latter in pursuing his interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He would rather impose upon the object of his concern </span>such terms
and conditions that would suit him, even if in so doing time inexorably marches
on against his favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this
cannot be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allowed to remain unreined.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It should be noted that the last communication the defendant
province admits to have knowledge of relative to this matter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>an indorsement to the General
Counsel of the Commission on Audit dated October 27, 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, it never bothered to follow this up with
an inquiry as to the action that was taken thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it blames the plaintiffs for
its non-receipt of any reply thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This supine attitude is hardly in keeping with human experience relative
to the exercise of one's duty to protect his interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here the defendant province harps on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">its </span>allegation that the land at issue
involves public interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being so,
it should have helped facilitate the approval of the vouchers, considering that
it has the bounded (sic) duty to uphold and protect public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">inte</span>rest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This the defendant never did, despite the
time element that it had to meet inasmuch as item (b) in the above-qouted
dispositive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">portion </span>of the
decision expressly states that payment was to be made within one (<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">1) year from receipt, in failure of which
said defendant had to vacate </span>and deliver the land to the prevailing
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This alternative should have
alerted the defendant to take the necessary steps to comply with the decision
if only to preserve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">its prior right and
thus uphold public </span>interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
opted, on the other hand, to reverse its side of the coin and place the
obligation on the plaintiffs' shoulders." (Rollo, pp. 66-67).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The complaint in the
instant case was filed on March 30, 1957.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

promulgated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the the private
respondents expected the payment of the value of their land occupied by the
Gubat High School, they still were unable to collect such payment eight years
after the promulgation of the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

additional requirement charging the private respondents with the duty to have
the corresponding title issued in the name of the municipality free from all
liens and encumbrances as a condition before the release of the payment for the
value of the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dispositive

payment </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the value of the
