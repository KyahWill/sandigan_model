Oppositor, (2) the decree of registration issued by the respondent Land
Registration Commissioner in the same case and (3) the Certificate of Title
issued by the respondent Registrar of Deeds of Masbate pursuant to the decree

petitioner's appeal in said LRC Case No. 301-III.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On January 28, 1978,
private respondent Robert Arevalo filed with the Court of First Instance of
Masbate an application for registration of title to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">six (6) parcels of land, designated as Lots
Nos. 1 to 6 in Plan Psu-05-001980. The lots have an aggregate area of 121.5599
hectares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On May 2, 1978, the
Solicitor-General filed by mail his notice of appearance. Said notice of
appearance reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"G r e e t i n g s :</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Please enter the appearance of the Solicitor General as
counsel for the Government in the above-entitled case, <u>and cause all notices
of hearings, orders, resolutions, decisions and other processes to be served
upon him at the Office of the Solicitor General, Department of Justice, Manila</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Provincial Fiscal of Masbate has been authorized to
appear in this case and therefore should also be fur­nished notices of
hearings, orders, reso­lutions, decisions, processes. <u>However, as the
Solicitor General retains super­vision and control of the representation in
this case and has to approve withdrawal of the case, non-appeal, or other
actions which appear to compromise the interests of the Government, only
notices of orders, resolutions, and decisions served on him will bind the party
represented</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Adverse parties are likewise requested to furnish both the
Solicitor General and the Fiscal with copies of their pleadings and
motions." (Original Record, p. 38. Emphasis Supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On July 5, 1978, the
Director of Lands and the Director of the Bureau of Forest Development repre­sented
by the Solicitor General through the office of the Provincial Fiscal of Masbate
filed by mail oppositions to the application for registration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

whole world with the exception of the Director of Lands and the Director of the
Bureau of Forest Development.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On September 4, 1978, the
respondent judge rendered a decision confirming private respondent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Robert </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">Arevalo's imperfect title to the six parcels of land and ordering the
registration thereof. The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, a decision is hereby rendered that the parcels of
land, Lots Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, described, bounded and plotted on Plan
Psu-05-001980 (Exhibit 'F') and its accompanying technical descriptions
(Exhibits 'G', 'G-1', 'G-2', 'G-3', 'G-4' and 'G-5'), respectively, be
REGISTERED and the title CONFIRMED, pursuant to Section 38 of Act No. 496 in
the name of the applicant, Robert <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Arevalo,

Alphine St., Merville Park, Parañaque, Metro Manila, subject to such
encumbrances as are stated under Section 39 of the same Act as maybe subsisting
and that should the need arises, the applicant shall cede in favor of the
government so much portion as may be needed for a road right-of-way
purposes."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On September 8, 1978, the
Provincial Fiscal of Masbate received a copy of the decision but did not
furnish a copy thereof to the Solicitor General. It was only on November 6,
1978 that the Solicitor General received a copy </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On October 13, 1978,
private respondent Robert Arevalo filed a motion for the issuance of a decree
on the ground that the decision had already become final and executory, thirty
(30) days having elapsed from the service of the decision to the parties and no
appeal having been interposed by any one. The motion was granted by the
respondent judge on October 18, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On December 5, 1978,
petitioner Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor General filed by
mail its notice of appeal and record of appeal, setting the latter for hearing
on December 15, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On January 9, 1979,
private respondent Robert Arevalo filed a motion to dismiss appeal on the
ground that the decision in this case has already become final and that said
decision has already been executed with the issuance of the decree in favor of
the applicant. Arevalo added that title was already issued in his name, and
registered with the Registrar of Deeds of Masbate as of November 29, 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On January 17, 1979, the
respondent judge issued an order dismissing the Republic's appeal for having
been filed out of time. The lower court stated that while it is true that the
power and/or right to withdraw opposition, to appeal or not to appeal, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">and other actions which appear to compromise
the interests of the government remained with the Solicitor General, yet the
said right should be exercised within the period prescribed by law from the
time the authorized representative received the order and/or decision being
appealed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The only issue before us
is whether the thirty-day period to appeal should be counted from the service </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the decision upon the fiscal or from the time it was received by the
Solicitor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioner relies on
our ruling in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Republic v.
Hon. </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Wenceslao M. Polo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> (89 SCRA 33), where we held that the
thirty-day appeal period should be counted from the time the Solicitor General
received a copy of the decision because the service of the decision upon the
City Fiscal did not operate as a service upon the Solicitor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondent relies on our ruling in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Republic v. Director of </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">Lands</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> (71 SCRA 426)
where we held that service upon the provincial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the Republic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We agree with the

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Republic v. Polo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> (89 SCRA </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">33) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">states catego­rically
that the thirty-day period should be counted from the date the Solicitor
General received a copy </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the decision because the service of the
decision upon the city fiscal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">did
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not operate as a service upon
the Solicitor General. We stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The issue is whether the thirty-day period should be reckoned
from the service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the decision
upon the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fiscal or from </span>the time
it was served upon the Solicitor General.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We hold that the thirty-day period should be counted from the
date when the Solicitor General received a copy of the decision because the
service of the decision upon the city <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">fiscal
</span>did not operate as a service upon the Solicitor General.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It should be clarified that, although the Solicitor General
requested the city fiscal to represent him in the trial court, he,
nevertheless, made his own separate appearance as counsel for the State. In
that 'notice of appearance', he expressly requested that he should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">be served in Manila with all notices of
hearings, orders, resolutions, decisions </span>and other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">processes' and that such service </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">distinct from </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">service of notices and other papers on the
city fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"The Solicitor General
also indicated in his 'notice of appearance' that he 'retains supervision and
control of the representation in this case and </span>has to approve withdrawal
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the case, </span><u>non-appeal</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or other actions which </span>appear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to compromise the interests </span>of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the Government' and that </span>'<u>only
notices of orders, resolutions and decisions served on him will bind</u>' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the Government.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"The Solicitor General
</span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">requesting the city fiscal to
represent him at the hearings called the attention of that official to Circular
No. 41 of the Secretary of Justice dated November 28, 1973 wherein provincial
and city fiscals were advised that, in cases where they represent the Solicitor
General, </span>'<u>service on the Solicitor General shall be the basis' 'for
the purpose of finality of the decision</u>'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this case, it is obvious that, strictly speaking, the city
fiscal did not directly represent the Government. He was merely a surrogate of
the Solicitor General whose office, 'as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">law </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">office of the Government of the Republic of
the Philippines', is the entity that is empowered </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">'represent the Government in all land registration and related proceedings'
(Sec. 1[e], Presidential Decree No. 478).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The trial court in disallowing the Government's appeal relied
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on </span>the ruling that the service
of the decision in a land registration case on the fiscal is necessarily a
service on the Solicitor General (<u>Republic v. Reyes</u>, L-35545, June 18,
1976, 71 SCRA 426, 436-437).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That ruling is not applicable to this case because in the <u>Reyes</u>
case the fiscal, as representative of the Solicitor General, was authorized not
only to attend hearings but also to file pleadings for the Government. In the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">instant case, the city fiscal's authority was
confined to attending the hearings. The Office of the Solicitor General was the
one that filed the pleadings and motions in the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Solicitor General in his petition herein observed that it
was the ruling in the <u>Reyes</u> case that prompted his office 'to revise
completely the letter of authority to fiscals representing' him by making it
clear that it is the service of the decision on the Solicitor General that
would bind the Government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <u>Reyes</u> case is no longer the law on the issue before us
apart from the fact that it is not appli­cable to the instant petition because
it has a different factual setting. The appeal was perfected on time and should
be given due course.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's order disallowing the
petitioner's appeal is reversed and set aside. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">The respondent court is directed to certify the appeal and transmit the
records to the appellate court (the record on appeal having been eliminated
under Section 18 of the Court's Interim Rules And Guidelines dated January 11,
1983). The decree of registration and the certificate of title issued in this
case are ordered cancelled for having been prematurely issued. No costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
