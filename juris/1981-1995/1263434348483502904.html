D. Simbulan, alias "Nene," and Elvira S. Sugui, alias
"Elvie," as conspirators in the sale and delivery of .17 gram of
methyl amphetamine hydrochloride, "shabu" in common parlance, which

of Republic Act No. 6425.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, both appellants, duly assisted by their
counsel <u>de</u> <u>parte</u>, pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.  Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued
wherein the prosecution presented four (4) witnesses, viz.:  S/Sgt. Rosalinda F. Directo, 1st Lt. Reuben

correctly summarized therein as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the morning of September 14, 1988, at around 9:00 a.m., a
male informant came to the office of the 13th Narcotics Regional Unit of the
NARCOM and relayed to Lt. Reuben Sindac the information that @ NENE and @ ELVIE
were engaged in the selling of shabu or methamphetamine hydrochloride at
Masangkay St., Makati, Metro Manila.  Finding this information to be viable (to use his own word), Lt. Sindac
submitted to Lt. Col. Raval of the NARCOM a pre-operation report.  Lt. Col. Raval approved the said
pre-operation report and directed Lt. Sindac to constitute a team and conduct a
buy-bust operation.  For the purpose, he
gave Lt. Sindac money for gasoline and P500.00 in five P100 bills as buy-money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The five P100 bills bear the serial numbers WF 210212 (Exh.
D), UM 242970 (Exh. G), WP 787691 (Exh. E), SZ 832140 (Exh. C), and UXZ 65475
(Exh. F).  Lt. Sindac marked each of
them by shading the letter 0 in Bangko Sentral, and had them xeroxed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The team constituted by Lt. Sindac was made up of himself, as
the team leader, Sgt. Rosalinda Directo, Sgt. Jaime Sapon, Sgt. Cesar Dalonos
and CIC Carlos Olina.  Lt. Sindac
designated Sgt. Directo as the poseur-buyer and the rest as back­ups.  Thus, he gave to Sgt. Directo the five P100
bills (Exhs. C to G).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the same morning the team of Lt. Sindac, together with the
informant, left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Camp </span>Crame for
Masangkay St., Makati, Metro Manila.  They reached this target area at around 10:30 a.m.  After a short briefing, Sgt. Directo and the
informant proceeded to the house of @ NENE, which is one of two houses located
inside a compound.  At the same
instance, Lt. Sindac and the other members of the team posted themselves at
strategic points from where they could watch Sgt. Directo and the informant
carry out their assigned task.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching the house of @ NENE the informant knocked on
the door and when @ NENE opened the door and came out, he introduced Sgt.
Directo as a person wanting to buy shabu.  Thereupon, @ NENE asked Sgt. Directo how much shabu she wanted to
buy.  When Sgt. Directo replied that she
wanted to buy 1/2 gram of shabu, @ NENE said that the price would be P500.00,
to which Sgt. Directo agreed.  Forthwith, @ NENE went back inside the house.  After a while she emerged from the same door, this time with
another woman.  @ NENE intro­duced this
woman to Sgt. Directo as ELVIE.  Having
done this, @ NENE told Sgt. Directo to give the P500.00 to Elvie, which Sgt.
Directo did.  Almost simultaneously @
NENE handed to Sgt. Directo a transparent plastic bag containing what appeared
to be shabu.  Upon her receipt thereof,
Sgt. Directo raised her right hand which was the pre-arranged signal to her
co-team members that she had already concluded the purchase of shabu.  Immediately, Lt. Sindac and Sgt. Dalonos
approached the four, (@) NENE, ELVIE, Sgt. Directo and the informant, and
introduced themselves as NARCOM agents.  Sgt. Sapon also moved in but he stopped just outside the fence and acted
as back-up to Lt. Sindac, Sgts. Directo and Dalonos.  Sgt. Directo then retrieved the 5 P100 bills she had earlier
given to ELVIE from the right front pocket of the latter's shorts where she saw
ELVIE had placed the money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the target area, Lt. Sindac and his team members brought
@ NENE, who was later identified to be accused Irene Simbulan, and ELVIE, who
turned out to be accused Elvira Sugui, to their headquarters in Camp
Crame.  They also brought there Erlinda
Sugui, the sister of Elvira Sugui, whom they found in possession of shabu.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon reaching their Headquarters, Sgt. Directo marked the
transparent plastic bag earlier given to her by @ NENE, that contained what
appeared to be shabu (Exh. K), with the letter 'A', prepared her 'Affidavit of
Poseur-Buyer' (Exh. A), and thereafter turned over the same to Lt. Sindac.  She also prepared the 'Receipt for Property
Seized" (Exh. L).  On the other
hand, Lt. Sindac and his other team members executed their 'Joint Affidavit of
Arrest' (Exh. B).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"By cover of a letter dated September 15, 1988 (Exh. J), the
NARCOM sent the suspected shabu (Exh. K) that was given by @ NENE to Sgt.
Directo to the PC Crime Laboratory Service for appropriate laboratory
examinations.  As requested in the said
letter (Exh. J), Capt. Lina C. Sarmiento, a forensic chemist, examined the said
specimen and found it positive for 'methamphetamine hydrochloride', a regulated
drug.  (Exhs. H and M)."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Expectedly, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">defense
presented </span>a different version, which we have culled from the decision of
the trial court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant Irene Simbulan testified that in the morning of September 14, 1988,
while she was cooking in the house of appellant Sugui, a certain Angel, whom
she had known for about two (2) years, came and told her "Kung maaari,
ikuha mo ako ng shabu." Angel used to frequent her house but this was the
first time that he asked for "shabu" from her.  She allegedly replied, "Alam mo ng wala
rito bakit dito ka pa pumunta sa amin." Angel, however, insisted on his
request saying that he needed shabu as he was going to a birthday party, hence
she relented and said "Mayroon dito pero hindi sa akin.  Kung gusto mo bayaran mo na lang sa
akin." Angel agreed, so she gave him the shabu and Angel gave her P500.00.  After he had left, she went to the other
house of appellant Sugui, in the same compound and gave the latter the P500.00
she received from Angel as her payment for a wrist watch.  She then went back to her cooking.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, without asking for permission, four (4) or five (5)
persons entered her house and said "Walang tatakbo." They asked her
to bring out the marked money, and she replied that the money was with
appellant Sugui.  She <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>the aforesaid persons then went to
appellant Sugui's house and the latter asked said appellant to bring out the
marked money.  Sugui replied,
"Anong marked money, wala naman akong pera kundi ito lang nasa pitaka
ko." Thereupon, the intruders took the wallet of Sugui and, upon seeing
the money in it, said, "Ito ang pera." The aforesaid persons
thereafter brought her and Sugui to Camp Crame where they were detained,
investigated and made to sign a "Receipt for Property Seized"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which listed the l/2 gram of "shabu" and the serial numbers of the
five (5) P100.00 bills indicated as "marked money."</p>

<p class="BODY">Elvira Sugui, for her part, testified that on September 14, 1988,
at about 10:00 A.M., she was in her house talking to her friend whom she only
knows as "Baby." Baby came to invite her to go with her to Syvel's
and while they were talking, appellant Simbulan came in with the three (3)
arresting officers.  The latter were
looking for the P500.00 which Simbulan had earlier given her as payment for a
wrist watch.  The arresting officers
took her wallet and then told her to go with them to Camp Crame.  Out of fear, she, together with her sister,
Erlinda, and Simbulan, went along with them to Camp Crame.  There, Lt. Sindac and Sgt. Dalonos <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">told </span>them that they could go home if
they could each produce P10,000.00.  As
they were unable to do so, Lt. Sindac and Sgt. Dalonos continued to detain
them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita Castillo, in corroboration of the testimony of appellant
Sugui, testified that she was in the house of the latter at about 10:00 o'clock
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the morning of September 14,
1988.  She went there to deliver a
Syvel's credit card to Sugui.  While she
was there, appellant Simbulan came in, gave some money to Sugui as payment for
a wrist watch and then left.  About
fifteen minutes later, Simbulan came back with three (3) persons, one of them a
female.  They were looking for money and
Simbulan pointed to Sugui.  Sugui told
them that the money that Simbulan had given her was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>her wallet.  The said
persons got the wallet of Sugui and took out from it five (5) P100.00 bills,
after which they brought her to their jeep.</p>

<p class="BODY">After evaluating the contradicting versions, the trial court
rendered judgment finding both appellants guilty of the crime charged, with the
following disposition:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused,
Elvira Sugui y Sunga and Irene Simbulan y Dolor, guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the offense charged in the information, and hereby sentences them to suffer
the penalty of life imprisonment or reclusion perpetua, and each of them to pay
a fine of thirty thousand pesos (P30,000.00).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellants are now before us seeking the reversal of the said
judgment, ascribing the following errors to the court below:  (1) That it erred in not acquitting both
accused-appellants on reasonable doubt; and (2) That it committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>error amounting to grave abuse of
discretion in finding accused-appellant Elvira Sugui, in conspiracy with
accused-appellant Irene Simbulan, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating
Section 15, Article III of Republic Art No. 6425, as amended, in relation to
Section 21, Article IV.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the errors assigned turn on the issue of credibility.  Accordingly, we have perforce to once again
reiterate the entrenched rule that the matter of assigning values to
declarations on the witness stand is best and most competently performed by the
trial judge, who, unlike appellate magistrates, can weigh such testimony in the
light of the declarant's demeanor, conduct and attitude at the trial and is
thereby placed in a more competent position to discriminate between the true
and the false.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellate courts will not disturb the credence, or lack of it, accorded by the
trial court to the testimony of witnesses unless it be clearly shown that the
latter court had overlooked or disregarded arbitrarily the facts and
circumstances of significance in the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> In
the case at bar, we find nothing which would warrant deviation from the general
rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The narration of the incident by the prosecution witnesses are
worthy of credit.  They are police
officers who are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner,
there being no evidence to the contrary,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> and
more so since there is nothing in the record which would indicate that they
were actuated by improper motives.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the testimonies of the apprehending officers were
straightforward and consistent.  As
expressly observed by the trial court in its decision ?</p>

<blockquote>"x x x, in the course of their testimonies, the Court was
intently observing the prosecution witnesses, particularly Sgt. Directo and Lt.
Sindac, and the Court was impressed by their candidness and straightforward
manner of testifying, which in the mind of the Court indicated that they had
testified truthfully.  As a matter of
fact, Lt. Sindac, who is only 27 years (old) had impressed the Court that he is
a professional whose only concern is to do his job and to do it well.  x x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is argued by appellants that the failure of the prosecution to
present the civilian informer was a fatal omission.  We do not agree.  The
poseur-buyer, S/Sgt. Directo, who dealt directly with appellants in the
purchase of the regulated drug was presented in the trial.  Hence, the testimony of the informer, if it
were given, would at best be corroborative or cumulative.  The rule is well settled that each party has
the prerogative to determine which witnesses to present and to dispense with
the testimony of persons <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">who </span>will
only give corroboration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
non-presentation of a mere corroborative witness does not amount to suppression
of evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, if the defense believed that the testimony of the
informer was important to their case, there was nothing to prevent them from
compelling the latter's presence and availing of his testimony in court by
compulsory process.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> The
informer was known to the defense.  It
would have been simple enough to have him produced by a subpoena for
examination as a defense witness.  This,
appellants inexplicably failed or declined to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegation of appellants that the marked money used were not
properly marked in accordance with accepted standard procedures, that is, by application
of fluorescent powder, does not deserve even a passing consideration.  How the buy-bust money should have been
marked was of no significance in establishing the guilt of appellants.  What is material is the proof that the drug
transaction transpired, coupled with the presentation in court of the <u>corpus</u>
<u>delicti</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, even the absence of the marked money or its non-presentation in court
would not create a hiatus in the prosecution's evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants further argue that even assuming that they were truly
engaged in the illicit trade, they would not have sold drugs right on their
doorstep and to a total stranger.  The
said argument cannot be upheld, just as it has been so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">often </span>raised in other cases and just as often struck down by this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Drug pushers have become increasingly casual about isolated
transactions.  They have come to
consider the sale of drugs as ordinary transactions and the buyers as ordinary
users.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Drug pushing when done on a small scale belongs to that class of crimes which
may be committed at any time and at any place.  After the offer to buy is accepted and the exchange is made, the illegal
transaction is completed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>a
few minutes.  The fact that the parties
are in a public place <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>in the
presence of other people may not always discourage them from pursuing their
illegal trade as such factors may even serve to camouflage the same.  Hence, the court has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">sustained the conviction of drug pushers caught selling illegal drugs
in a billiard hall, in front of a store, along </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">street, and in front of
a house.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Even the fact that the buyer is a total
stranger is of no moment.  In real life,
</span>pushers, especially small quantity or retail pushers, sell their
prohibited wares to customers, be they strangers or not, who have the price of
the drug.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The supposed irreconcilable inconsistency pointed out by
appellants regarding the weight of the "shabu" purchased, as
testified to and as submitted in evidence, is too minor to militate against the
credibility of the prosecution witness.  The "shabu" submitted in evidence was properly identified in
court by the examining forensic chemist and by the poseur?buyer to be the
same "shabu" seized from appellants and submitted to the former for
examination in connection with this case.  The discrepancy in weight is explained by the fact that what was
expected and believed to have been purchased by the poseur-buyer was one-half
(l/2) gram of "shabu." The fact that what was delivered is of lesser
weight cannot be taken against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The poseur-buyer was not in a position to determine the actual
weight of the drug delivered by appellants, as can be gleaned from her
testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now you mentioned also earlier Madam witness
that you were shabu (sic) and placed in plastic transparent.  Now also you stated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">you </span>gave P500.00 to Elvie.  Now why P500.00 Madam witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
that is the price that Aling Nene asked for 1/2 gram.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
that point do y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ou </span>know how much
shabu y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ou </span>received from Aling
Nene?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
presumed it was half gram.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Though
you are not sure whether you received also l/2 grams (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even appellant's allegation that the apprehending officers asked
them for money, being an imputation which can be contrived with facility, is
not entitled to credence.  They utterly
failed to substantiate the same.  The
Court has noted that this is the usual defense in the prosecution of drug
cases.  Yet, if indeed there was any
attempted or consummated extortion, appellants could and should have come
forward with the proper charges against the culprits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants further maintain that the trial court's finding of
conspiracy is without basis.  We
disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants Irene Simbulan and Elvira Sugui were obviously
partners in the sale of "shabu." The prosecution was able to
establish that both of them were present at the place and time when the
buy-bust operation took place.  It was
Simbulan who handed the drug to the poseur-buyer while it was Sugui who
accepted the payment.  The
aforementioned acts show concerted action and unity of purpose towards the
attainment of a common criminal objective and which ineluctably signify and
warrant a conclusion on the existence of a conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.2in">Conspiracy may be inferred from the
coordinated movements of the co-conspirators.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The fact of sale of the regulated drug in the morning of
September 14, 1988 was admitted by appellant Simbulan, although she denied
ownership of the same.  As we have
heretofore ruled, ownership and possession are not indispensable elements of
this crime.  The mere act of selling or
even acting as broker in the sale of marijuana and other prohibited drugs
consummates the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to appellant Sugui, it was admitted that the marked
money was found in her possession.  However, she denied that she was present at the time of the sale and
claimed that the marked money was given to her by Simbulan as payment for a
wrist watch and that the same was delivered to her inside her house.  We <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">find
her protestations </span>of innocence unworthy of belief.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, in her testimony, Simbulan unwittingly admitted that
Elvira (or Elvie) Sugui was in the house where she was staying at the time when
the buy-bust operation took place, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:  Do you remember where were you on Sept. 14,
1988 in the morning of that day?<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>  A:<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was at home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp; </span>What were you doing at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was cooking.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">  Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>Do you remember
who were there in your house during that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">  A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">  A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My nieces and my
nephews.  Erlinda Sugui, <u>Elvie</u> <u>Sugui</u>
and Rico Flores." (Emphasis supplied.)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the version <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
defense that the poseur-buyer left after the sale, and then later returned
together <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">with </span>other NARCCOM
agents to make an arrest, is illogical and absurd.  In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>buy-bust
operation, drug dealers are apprehended in <u>flagrante</u> <u>delicto</u>, not
in a disjointed manner or sequence as appellants would portray.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, appellants did not impute, much less prove, any ill
motive on the part of the NARCOM agents that would impel them to involve
appellants in a serious criminal charge.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">There is </span>nothing in the
records of the case suggesting that the testimonies of the NARCOM agents were
motivated by any reason other than their mission to curb drug abuse.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the prosecution's narration of facts and identification of the
accused-appellants should be given weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the foregoing disquisition and considerations, we find that
the trial court acted correctly in finding both appellants guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime charged.  However, the dispositive portion of its decision imposes the penalty of
"life imprisonment or reclusion perpetua." Section 15, Article III of
Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, provides for the penalty of life
imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P20,000.00 to P30,000.00.  We are, therefore, constrained to call
attention once again to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">fact </span>that
life imprisonment and <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> are not the same.  <u>Reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, as
understood in the Revised Penal Code, has its own legal connotation, effects
and accessory penalties which are not applicable to life imprisonment provided
for by the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 which is a special law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
For the imposition of the correct penalty, therefore, the reference to <u>reclusion</u>
<u>perpetua</u> in said judgment of the trial court should be and is hereby
deleted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, subject to the foregoing modification, the
assailed decision is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
