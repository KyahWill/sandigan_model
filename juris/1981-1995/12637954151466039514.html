<p>Application of the established rule in this jurisdiction, that the acquittal 
of an accused on reasonable doubt is not generally an impediment to the 
imposition, in the same criminal action, of civil liability for damages on said 
accused, is what is essentially called into question by the appellant in this 
case.<br><br>The information which initiated the instant criminal proceedings in 
the Court of First Instance of Rizal indicted three (3) persons — Lt. Rizalino 
M. Ubay, Mrs. Milagros Pamintuan, and Mrs. Julia T. Maniego — for the crime of 
MALVERSATION committed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That on or about the period covering the month of May, 1957 up to and 
including the month of August, 1957, in Quezon City, Philippines, the 
above-named accused, conspiring together, confederating with and helping one 
another, with intent of gain and without authority of law, did, then and there, 
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously malverse, misappropriate and misapply 
public funds in the amount of P66,434.50 belonging to the Republic of the 
Philippines, in the following manner, to wit:&nbsp; the accused, Lt. RIZALINO M. 
Ubay, a duly appointed officer in the Armed Forces of the Philippines in active 
duty, who, during the period specified above, was designated as Disbursing 
Officer in the Office of the Chief of Finance, GHQ, Camp Murphy, Quezon City, 
and as such was entrusted with and had under his custody and control public 
funds, conspiring and confederating with his co-accused, MILAGROS T. PAMINTUAN 
and JULIA T. MANIEGO, did then and there, unlawfully, willfully and feloniously, 
with intent of gain and without authority of law, and in pursuance of their 
conspiracy, take, receive, and accept from his said co-accused several personal 
checks drawn against the Philippine National Bank and the Bank of the Philippine 
Islands, of which the accused, MILAGROS T. PAMINTUAN is the drawer and the 
accused, JULIA T. MANIEGO, is the indorser, in the total amount of P66, 434.50, 
cashing said checks and using for this purpose the public funds entrusted to and 
placed under the custody and control of the said Lt.Rizalino M. Ubay, all the 
said accused knowing fully well that the said checks are worthless and are not 
covered by funds in the aforementioned banks, for which reason the same were 
dishonored and rejected by the said banks when presented for encashment, to the 
damage and prejudice of the Republic of the Philippines, in the amount of 
P66,434.50, Philippine currency."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Only Lt. Ubay and Mrs. Maniego were arraigned, Mrs. Pamintuan having 
apparently fled to the United States in August, 1962.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Both Ubay and Maniego entered a plea of 
not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After trial 
judgment was rendered by the Court of First Instance<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>, the dispositive part whereof reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There being sufficient evidence beyond reasonable doubt against the accused, 
Rizalino M. Ubay, the Court hereby convicts him of the crime of malversation and 
sentences him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion temporal</em> of TWELVE 
(12) YEARS, ONE (1) DAY to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS, and a fine of 
P57, 434.50 which is the amount malversed, and to suffer perpetual special 
disqualification.<br><br>"<em>In the absence of evidence against accused Julia 
T. Maniego, the Court hereby acquits her, but both she and Rizal T. Ubay are 
hereby ordered to pay jointly and severally the amount of P57,434.50 to the 
government</em>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Maniego sought reconsideration of the judgment, praying that she be absolved 
from civil liability or, at the very least, that her liability be reduced to 
P46,934.50<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Court declined to 
negate her civil liability, but did reduce the amount thereof&nbsp; to 
P46,934.50.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> She appealed to the Court 
of Appeals<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> as Ubay had earlier 
done.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Ubay's appeal was 
subsequently dismissed by the Appellate Court because of his failure to file 
brief.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> On the other hand, Maniego 
submitted her brief in due course, and ascribed three (3) errors to the Court 
<em>a quo</em>, to wit: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1)&nbsp; The Lower Court erred in holding her civilly liable to indemnify the 
Government for the value of the checks after she had been found not guilty of 
the crime out of which the civil liability arises.<br><br>2)&nbsp; Even assuming 
arguendo that she could properly be held civilly liable after her acquittal, it 
was error for the lower Court to adjudge her liable as an indorser to indemnify 
the government for the amount of the checks.<br><br>3)&nbsp; The Lower Court erred in 
declaring her civilly liable jointly and severally with her co-defendant Ubay, 
instead of absolving her altogether.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Because, in the Appellate Court's view, Maniego's brief raised only questions 
of law, her appeal was later certified to this Court pursuant to Section 17, in 
relation to Section 31, of the Judiciary Act, as amended, and Section 3, Rule 50 
of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>The 
verdict must go against the appellant.<br><br>Well known is the principle that 
"any person criminally liable for felony is also civilly liable"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup>.&nbsp; But a person adjudged not criminally 
responsible may still be held to be civilly liable.&nbsp; A person's acquittal of a 
crime on the ground that his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable 
doubt<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> does not bar a civil action for 
damages founded on the same acts involved in the offense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> "Extinction of the penal action does not 
carry with it extinction of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a 
declaration in a final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise 
did not exist."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rule 111 SEC. 3(b) — Extinction of the penal action does not carry with it 
extinction of the civil, unless the extinction proceeds from a declaration in a 
final judgment that the fact from which the civil might arise did not exist.&nbsp; In 
other cases, the person entitled to the civil action may institute it in the 
jurisdiction and in the manner provided by law against the person who may be 
liable for restitution of the thing and reparation of indemnity for the damage 
suffered." (1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure).</p></blockquote>
<p>Hence, contrary to her submission<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>, 
Maniego's acquittal on reasonable doubt of the crime of Malversation imputed to 
her and her two (2) co-accused did not operate to absolve her from civil 
liability for reimbursement of the amount rightfully due to the Government as 
owner thereof.&nbsp; Her liability therefor could properly be adjudged, as it was so 
adjudged, by the Trial Court on the basis of the evidence before it, which 
adequately establishes that she was an indorser of several checks drawn by her 
sister, which were dishonored after they had been exchanged with cash belonging 
to the Government, then in the official custody of Lt. Ubay.<br><br>Appellant's 
contention that as mere indorser, she may not be made liable on account of the 
dishonor of the checks indorsed by her, is likewise untenable.&nbsp; Under the law, 
the holder or last indorsee of a negotiable instrument has the right to "enforce 
payment of the instrument for the full amount thereof against all parties liable 
thereon."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> Among the "parties liable 
thereon" is an indorser of the instrument <em>i.e.</em>, "a person placing his 
signature upon an instrument otherwise than as maker, drawer, or acceptor ** 
unless he clearly indicates by appropriate words his intention to be bound in 
some other capacity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Such an 
indorser "who indorses without qualification," <em>inter alia</em> "engages that 
on due presentment,** (the instrument) shall be accepted or paid, or both, as 
the case may be, according to its tenor, and that if it be dishonored, and the 
necessary proceedings on dishonor be duly taken, he will pay the amount thereof 
to the holder, or to any subsequent indorser who may be compelled to pay 
it."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Maniego may also be deemed an 
"accomodation party" in the light of the facts, <em>i.e.</em>, a person "who has 
signed the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor, or indorser, without receiving 
value therefor, and for the purpose of lending his name to some other 
person."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> As such, she is under the 
law "liable on the instrument to a holder for value, notwithstanding such holder 
at the time of taking the instrument knew ** (her) to be only an accommodation 
party"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>, although she has the right, 
after paying the holder, to obtain reimbursement from the party accommodated, 
"since the relation between them is in effect that of principal and surety, the 
accommodation party being the surety."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>One last word.&nbsp; The Trial Court 
acted correctly in adjudging Maniego to be civilly liable in the same criminal 
action in which she had been acquitted of the felony of Malversation ascribed to 
her, dispensing with the necessity of having a separate civil action 
subsequently instituted against her for the purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the 
judgment of the Trial Court, being entirely in accord with the facts and the 
law, is hereby affirmed <em>in toto</em>, with costs against the 
appellant.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
