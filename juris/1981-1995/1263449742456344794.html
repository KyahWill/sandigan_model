the reading of the information and entered a plea of NOT GUILTY.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During trial, the
prosecution sought to establish the guilt of the accused by presenting five witnesses,

Villa, the victim who was then 15 to 16 years at the time of the alleged rape,
is summarized by the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On January 13, 1970, at about 2:00 in the morning, she and <span class="SpellE">Shirly</span> de Lara were eating at the <span class="SpellE">Saulog</span>
Canteen located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City, having come from the Jade East Night Club where she worked as an ago-go
dancer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their way <span style="">out of the c</span>anteen, they met the three
accused, one of whom named Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>, who offered
to bring her home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Rosie refused
the offer, the three accused hailed a taxicab and Julius Clark forced her
inside the cab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taxicab was already
occupied by a passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three
accused joined her inside the taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Inside the vehicle, she was boxed on the stomach by Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie asked
the accused to bring her to Reno Hotel where she lived, but upon reaching the
hotel the taxicab did not stop and instead the vehicle speeded away towards the
Tourist Spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie did not shout for
help on the way because her mouth was covered by <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Clark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they reached the Tourist
Spot, Julius Clark dragged her out of the taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other accused also alighted from the
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the driver drove the
vehicle away with the unidentified passenger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the taxicab left <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Clark threw
Rosie down face up on the ground, and despite her screams, he placed himself
horizontally on top of her and succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her
with the assistance of Julius Clark, who held her legs, and of Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>, who held her hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Clark
has finished with her, one of the accused boxed her and then Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> also raped her, aided in the dastardly act by
Julius, who held her hands, and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, who held her
legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>
was through, Julius Clark took his turn and while he was having sexual
intercourse with her, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> held her two legs and <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> took hold of her hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(When Rosie was narrating how she was raped
in succession by the three accused, she was crying.) <span class="GramE">Just
then a man whom she came to know later as Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>,
Jr. arrived at the scene and he fired a shot.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> fired
the shot, Julius Clark and Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> stood up <span style="">and </span>attempted to escape but <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> fired at them, stopping them on their way up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> then turned
his flashlight on the two accused and then on Rosie, who was still lying on the
ground naked from the waist down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie
then stood up to put on her "jean".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Rosie was dressing up, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> noticed <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Clark lying among the grasses on a prone position
and so he ordered <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> to get up and join his
co-accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
ordered the three accused to go to the road where he flagged down a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and he instructed the driver to call for the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few minutes thereafter, a
patrol jeep of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City Police Department
arrived and she and the three accused were directed to ride on the vehicle and
they were brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> police headquarters, where she
filed charges of rape against the three accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival at the police headquarters,
Rosie went to the comfort <span style="">room of the
police headquarters and she washed her vagina because she was afraid she might
get pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After washing her genital
organ, she returned to the office of the Chief of Police to whom she gave an
account of the rapes committed at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Half-Moon</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Beach</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the afternoon Rosie was interrogated by a police investigator to whom she gave
a written statement marked Exhibit "C".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also examined at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Olongapo</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">General</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> by a lady physician and she was furthermore
issued a medical certificate marked Exhibit "E".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the preliminary investigation of the
case, she was threatened with bodily harm by one Luis <span class="SpellE">Midnat</span>,
a companion of the accused, if she testified against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was also maltreated by the other
companions of the accused, and in this connection, she showed to the Court the
black marks below her eyes where she was boxed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> companions also threatened Rosie
with further maltreatment if she continued to prosecute the criminal cases
against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to the
notary public </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">sign an already prepared document which she
did not even read because she was intimidated by the companions of the
accused."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Corroborating the testimony

<blockquote>"His residence at <st1:place><st1:placename>Half-Moon</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place> is just 50 meters below a
place known as Tourist Spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1970</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>,
who was inside his house, heard <span class="GramE">woman's</span> screams coming
from the <span style="">direction </span>of the
Tourist Spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without delay he took his
gun <span style="">and </span>flashlight and went to
the place where the shouts came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> moved cautiously to where the woman was shouting,
and he saw on a small clearing inside the premises of the Tourist Spot a person
who was later identified as Julius Clark having sexual intercourse with a girl
whose name he came to know afterwards as Rosie de Villa, while another named
Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> held her feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Julius Clark was through, Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> raped Rosie de Villa, while Julius Clark held her
feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> fired his gun three times in the air, and then he turned
his flashlight on the two accused and motioned them to move to the left with
his flashlight, as he approached Rosie de Villa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Julius Clark and Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>
complied with <span class="SpellE">Dumlao's</span> signal, and when <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> moved towards Rosie, he saw her half-naked lying on
the ground face upwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie de Villa
had no jean or panty on, and she was wearing only a T-shirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was crying and she tried to cover her
naked body with her hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> instructed Rosie to put on her dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this time, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
saw <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Clark lying prostrate on the ground among
the tall grasses, about 2 meters away from where the girl lay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
was not doing anything to the offended party when <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
told <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> to join the other two accused, and <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> complied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> ordered the three accused to move on to the
road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the road <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
stopped a passing passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and told the
driver thereof to call for the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ayunque</span> and another policeman
arrived riding in an <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City Police patrol
jeep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
delivered custody of the three accused to the policemen and he also informed
the policemen that he is willing to testify in the criminal case which Rosie
may file against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie de Villa
joined the accused inside the police jeep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the afternoon of the same date, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> was
interrogated by Patrolman Roberto Barnes of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
police to whom he gave a statement marked Exhibit "A".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Threats of bodily harm were hurled at <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> should he testify against the accused who are
members of the dreaded <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span> Gang, and so he hid in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and then in San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he gathered enough courage to appear
before the Fiscal during the preliminary investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the investigation before the Fiscal, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> had occasion to talk to Rosie de Villa and she
informed him that she too was threatened by the companions of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> prepared a
sketch marked Exhibit "B" showing the scene of the crime, and he
indicated therein by mark Exhibit "B-1" the spot where Rosie was
raped and by mark Exhibit "B-2" where he was when he witnessed the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Exhibit "B-1" was illuminated by lights of passing vehicles

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Patrolman Roberto Barnes of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City Police Department, desk sergeant on the date
of the incident, disclosed that he took the written statement of prosecution
witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr. as well as the statement of
Rosie de Villa.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Olongapo</span></span><span style=""> City Fiscal Abraham <span class="SpellE">Anonas</span>
declared that he conducted the preliminary investigation of the criminal
complaints for rape filed by Rosie de Villa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span> Beltran, resident physician
of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City General Hospital testified that
together with Dr. <span class="SpellE">Servando</span> Gutierrez (who had already
left the service), she treated Rosie de Villa who complained that she was
raped; that she took her case history; that she conducted physical and internal
examinations on Rosie de Villa by using the cervical smear method; that her
findings negated Rosie's having had a recent sexual contact, although she found
her to have had previous sexual experience; that if a female did vaginal
washing before examination, it is possible that the male sperm cells inside the
vagina would be removed; that even if the sexual intercourse took place ten to
twelve hours before the medical examination, it is possible that male
spermatozoa would still be present inside the vagina; and that the abrasions found
on Rosie's body may have been caused by her stumbling on the ground.</p>

the following exhibits:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evidence for the accused
consisted of their testimonies as well as the statements given at the witness
stand by Drs. <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Lemque</span>,
Ernesto Castillo and Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>, Atty. Leonardo

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lemque</span>, resident physician of the <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City General Hospital and in charge of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department
of the hospital declared that he handled several rape cases and that he was a
witness in two such cases in court; that he did not conduct any examination on
Rosie de Villa; that while there are 150 to 300 million sperm cells per male
ejaculation, it is highly improbable for sperm cells to be removed from the
vagina with soap and water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Dr. Ernesto Castillo, in
charge of the Laboratory Section of the same hospital, testified that he had a
hand in the preparation of Exhibit "E" by releasing the </span>result
of the laboratory examination after his confirmation; that by way of
verification of the results of the examination by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Basilia</span>
Beltran of Rosie de Villa, he examined by means of the direct smear and the
staining methods specimen materials given by Dr. Beltran which she allegedly
took from the vagina of Rosie de Villa, for the purpose of determining the
presence of male sperm cells; that while there are from 40 to 120 sperm cells
in a cubic centimeter of seminal fluid, the normal release of <span style="">a </span>male genital organ being from 2 to 6
cubic meters of seminal fluid per ejaculation, he found no sperm cells in the
material he examined; that while it is possible to remove all sperm cells from
the vagina by washing it with soap and water, it is not conceivable to take out
all sperm cells from the cervical canal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He admitted, however, that he did not conduct vaginal or cervical
examination of Rosie de Villa.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>, rural health physician
of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> City, corroborated the testimony of Dr.
Castillo to the effect that it is difficult to remove all sperm cells from the
vagina by washing after emission because a few may still be hidden in the
crevices of the vaginal canal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Leonardo Gonzales declared that while he prepared an
affidavit of desistance marked Exhibit "1" which was signed by Rosie
de Villa in his law office, he never talked with Rosie before the preparation
of said exhibit; that it was one Rudy Villa (no relation of Rosie) who asked
him to prepare the document; that paragraphs 2 and 3 of Exhibit "1"
are his own words and they were formulated in accordance with certain patterns
of affidavits of desistance in his law office.</p>

Rosie did not sleep at the hotel in the night of January 12, 1970; that Rosie

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants' assertion

<blockquote>"(W<span class="GramE">)hat</span> Rosie de Villa testified
was:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she was with Shirley de Lara

of 13 January 1970; that after a while, she left, and at a distance of 28
meters away from the canteen, she met the appellants ... Then the latter called
for a taxicab and they forced her to ride in it (pp. 2-3, 77 and 82, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., 24 February 1970).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not state that when she was forcibly taken by the appellants,
Shirley de Lara was still with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, she could not and did not cite her as a witness to the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, de Villa
testified that at the time she was forced into the taxicab (p. 74, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>ibid</u>.), there were no longer any customers
at the <span class="SpellE">Saulog</span> Canteen (p. 75, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<u>ibid</u>.), and the vicinity was already deserted (p. 81, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was what she obviously meant <span style="">when
</span>she said she was already alone at that time at the <span class="SpellE">Saulog</span>
Canteen, as was quoted in the appellants' brief (p. 8, Appellants' Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not necessarily admit as appellants
would want to imply, that Shirley de Lara was not after all with her, as she
had testified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that Shirley de Lara and Rosie de Villa had no
quarrel between them, this is no reason why de Lara could not have lied in her
testimony denying that she was with De Villa at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="1">13 January 1970</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been shown during the trial that she
is a member of the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span>-Na-Gang to which the
appellants belong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was proved by
her picture, Exhibit F-1, showing the tattoo marks "BNG" on her right
thigh, Exhibit F-1-B (p. 70, rec. of Criminal Case No. 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore, natural to expect that her
sympathies are with the appellants who are her <span class="SpellE">gangmates</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, she did not wait for a subpoena
to testify in court (p. 19, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., 24 February
1970).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As per her admission, she was requested
by the wife of Julius Clark to testify (p. 20, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<u>ibid</u>.), and she made insinuations about an illicit relation developed
later between Rosie de Villa and Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr. in
an attempt to discredit them (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <u>ibid</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her police record shows that she has been
apprehended and/or convicted in a long line of criminal cases, including two
apprehensions for vagrancy <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">G, p. 71, rec. of Criminal Case No.

as any mercenary motive could be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
influence of the interest of a friend, or of the society of which the witness

that he witnessed Julius followed by Jose having sexual consort with the

and as to who of them held her arms and legs while one of them was raping her
(pp. 8-12, Appellants' Brief), yet we do not agree with the appellants'
contention that these inconsistencies can only mean one thing, and that is,
"that there is no truth to what complainant Rosie de Villa said regarding
the commission of the alleged crime." For such contradictions and
inconsistencies indicate veracity rather than prevarication (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Viñas</span>, 25 SCRA 683, 28 October 1968), and they do not
necessarily affect the credibility of the witnesses (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Hamtig</span>, 29 SCRA 14; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gensola</span>,
29 SCRA 483).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is precisely in such
circumstances as would reveal some little variation in details that testimonies
would deserve weight (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, et al., G.
R. No. L-4801, <st1:date year="1953" day="30" month="6">30 June 1953</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides, the said inconsistencies can be explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has already been pointed out, that morning
of the incident was the first time Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr.
ever set eyes on the <span class="GramE">appellants.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not know them by their names and he
came to know of their identities only later on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same is true with Rosie de Villa, who was not at the time well
familiar with the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she
gave her story to the police, she did not identify the appellants by their
names, as can be shown by her statement, Exhibit C (p. 18, rec. of <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 15).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She only pointed them out to the investigator, as what she did when she
testified in court (pp. 2-3, 62 &amp; 63, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="2">24 February 1970</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, coupled with the fallibility of the
human memory, can very well explain why these two witnesses could not dove-tail
in all the details of their respective narrations, particularly in pointing out
the order in which the three appellants had raped Rosie de Villa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both witnesses, however, were consistent and
corroborative on the main and essential fact:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that Rosie de Villa was raped, and that the appellants herein were the
perpetrators ... (T<span class="GramE">)he</span> mere possibility that there was
variance in the testimonies of De Villa and <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> as
to the order in which the former was raped and as to who was holding her arms
and legs at the time, will not necessarily destroy the established fact that
she was raped in succession by the appellants..."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Our jurisprudence is
replete with cases giving weight and credence to prosecution witnesses'
testimonies, although characterized by minor inconsistencies </span>or
contradictions but absent improper motives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To cite the more recent cases, <span class="GramE">We</span> have <u>People
v. <span class="SpellE">Bagsican</span></u>, L-13486, <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="10">31 October 1962</st1:date>, 6 SCRA 400, where great stress
was laid by the defense upon the differences in narration of details by some of
those who testified for the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, for those contradictions, the rule in <span class="SpellE"><u>falsus</u></span><u>
in <span class="SpellE">uno</span> <span class="SpellE">falsus</span> omnibus was
vehemently</u> invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was ruled
that it would be unreasonable for the Court to sustain appellants' position
with respect to those differences in details into which, truly, on occasions,
some of the prosecution witnesses lapsed … that it is quite obvious that said
contradictions were inconsequential.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They did not touch upon any matter of significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were such minor differences as naturally
were bound to arise from truthful descriptions of things past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had their testimonies been so perfect, so
flawless, so completely accurate in details, would they not only then have
offered themselves to serious suspicion that the testimonies they gave were
fabricated and rehearsed?</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span></u>, L-26867,
June 30, 1970, 33 SCRA 812, where We adjudged as a truism that the most candid
witness oftentimes commits mistakes and incurs inconsistencies in his declarations,
but such honest lapses do not necessarily impair his intrinsic
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Far from being evidence of
falsehood they could justifiably be regarded as a demonstration of good faith
and a confirmation of the fact that the witness was not a rehearsed witness;</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Resayaga</span></u>, L-23234,
December 26, 1973, 54 SCRA 350, which considered that inconsistencies, even
improbabilities, in the testimony of a witness, especially on minor details or
collateral matters is a common phenomenon; that it is not unusual to have
accounts of witnesses regarding the same occurrence as contradictory on certain
details; that there is no perfect or omniscient witness because there is no
person with perfect faculties or senses;</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span></u>, L-26647, August 15, 1974, </span>58 SCRA 370,
where We pointed out the rule that inconsistencies in the testimony of

not affect either the substance of their declaration, their veracity or weight
of their testimony; and</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span></u>, L-32914,
August 30, 1974, 58 SCRA 737, where We <span style="">ruled
</span>that inconsistencies or discrepancies in the declarations of prosecution
witnesses which are not glaring, strengthen their credibility and show that
their testimonies were not coached or rehearsed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discrepancies may be attributed to
deficiencies in observation and recollection, or misapprehension of the
misleading and confusing questions during cross-examination, or to the
defective translation of the questions and answers but they do <span style="">not </span>necessarily indicate a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> attempt to commit falsehood (citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>, 110 Phil. 839).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants likewise point to the improbability of rape having
been committed as complaining witness declared that she did not notice any
ejaculation from any of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
discredit Rosie de Villa's credibility, appellants point to the following
circumstances negating the commission of rape:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) complainant's admission that this occasion is not exactly her first sexual
experience as she came to know of this when she cohabited with a man; and (2)
the medico-legal certificate showed that she is a non-virgin and that despite
the alleged sexual experience, there were no abrasions found around her vaginal
cleft, no congestion, and vaginal mucosa smooth, no abrasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they question why she should wash her
"private part" at the police station to avoid getting pregnant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rosie de Villa, in answer to a question from the court, testified
that she did not notice any ejaculation from the appellants because she was
afraid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, this statement of
Rosie de Villa reveals more than what the defense has bargained for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It bolsters, rather than destroys the theory
that at the time Rosie de Villa was being raped by three men, one after the
other, she was fighting against it with all her might, and that it was very
much against her will; she was not concentrating on the act; that she was being
subjected at the same time to physical violence, such as fist blows on her
stomach; and that she did not give any cooperation at all to the sexual act,
much less derived any enjoyment from it, as the appellants would want to
imply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree, however, that
because she did not notice any ejaculation, she would no longer be in a
position to narrate the circumstances under which she was raped, because there
is no showing that she had lost all consciousness at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is this circumstance inconsistent
with Rosie de Villa's testimony that she washed her private parts at the police
<span style="">station to avoid getting pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She washed as a precautionary measure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if she did not notice any ejaculation,
she could not be sure that the appellants had not in fact ejaculated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no truth to the allegation of the appellants that Rosie
de Villa has admitted that the concept of ejaculation <span style="">is </span>not exactly new to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear from her testimony that the time the multiple rape in
question occurred, she did not yet know what ejaculation means, and it was only
during the trial that she learned about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that she was then only about 15 years of age, just <span style="">a little </span>more than a child, her testimony
on this point can easily be believed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants maintain that rape could not have been committed
considering that the alleged scene of the crime is near the public highway and
at a place where motor vehicles continually passed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution counters by pointing out that
the scene of the occurrence was surrounded by tall grasses such that a person
in prone position could be hidden from view unless one crawled near the place
as witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr. did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from this, one must consider that the
accused who are members of the <span class="SpellE">Bahala</span> Na Gang are
three in number - <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>, Julius and Jose - three
young men at the peak of their vigor and strength, being then 23, 27 and 24
years of age, respectively; three stalwart and energetic young men in their
prime and have been exposed to the rigors and adversities of life being
fishermen by occupation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
surprising, therefore, if they acted with boldness, daring and intrepidity
because they could easily overpower and silence their young victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants would also want to give the impression that because
Rosie de Villa was an ago-go dancer and she admitted having drank liquor before
the <span class="GramE">incident,</span> she might have consented to the rape
committed against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This posture is
highly improbable and utterly incredible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On all fours with the case at bar on this point is the case of <u>People
v. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span></u>, 35 SCRA 633, <st1:date year="1970" day="30" month="10">30 October 1970</st1:date>, wherein <span class="GramE">We</span>
ruled, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, no woman would have consented to have sexual
intercourse with two men - or three - *** in the presence of each other, unless
she were a prostitute or as morally debased as one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the record before us contains no
indication that <span class="SpellE">Formacita</span>, a 14-year old, *** can be
so characterized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>*** In fact,
appellants could not even suggest any reason why <span class="SpellE">Formacita</span>
would falsely impute to them the commission of the crime charged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, there
is not an iota of evidence to show that Rosie de Villa ever sold herself to the
public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that she is an ago-go
dancer in a night club does not militate against her for ago-go dancing is
merely dancing in the modern manner as seen every night in TV shows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that this girl of 15 did not
even dance with customers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, if
she had consented to have sexual intercourse with the accused, then why should
she be shouting "<span class="SpellE">Tulungan</span> <span class="SpellE">n'yo</span>
<span class="SpellE">ako</span>, <span class="SpellE">ayaw</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ko</span></span>," to which cry <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> responded?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The defense never attempted to explain why <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
appeared in the scene and why he apprehended them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their brief, the
appellants quote a portion of the testimony of the complaining witness wherein
she testified that she was not conscious of what was going on at the time the
appellants allegedly committed the alleged sexual intercourse, which testimony
they claim as casting more doubt on her credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to state, however, that in her
answer to the next succeeding question of the defense counsel, the point was
clarified beyond all doubt, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
if you do not know what are those things going on, how come that you testified
before this Honorable Court that the three of them had used you one after the other?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
when they spank my abdomen that was the time I became conscious and I noticed
the removal of my panty." <span style="">(p. </span>63,
<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., 13 April 1970)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellants assail the
testimony of prosecution witness Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr. on
the ground that if it is true that rape was being committed by Julius Clark followed
by Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span>, why did he have to wait until <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> was through before he helped the girl?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>, Jr.
satisfactorily explained this in his testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In answer to questions propounded by the court, he testified:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why
did you have to wait for <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> to have sexual
intercourse with the girl?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did you
not fire your gun after June Clark stood up?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would like to see also what they are doing.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
thought you said <span style="">a </span>while ago
that you responded to the call for help?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
responded but not immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
seeing that they are in the actual performance and I am single, I would like to
see what they are doing." (pp. 28-29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1970" day="23" month="2">23 February 1970</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the above testimony of <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
is honest enough and is at the same time credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is indeed single and it was natural for
him to be curious of what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants' contention that his actuations belie his alleged good
intentions is beside the point, for whatever <span class="SpellE">Dumlao's</span>
motives were, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot see how they would detract
from the fact that he actually saw the two appellants rape the girl.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the appellants' contention that since <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
admitted that he was excited by the scene he saw, "then De Villa must have
been cooperating all the way, otherwise, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot see
why <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> would have to wait and enjoy the
scene." Appellants lose sight of the fact that different individuals react
differently to certain perceptions or even similar situations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To take an extreme example, some people are
repelled by violence while others derive pleasure from it; some persons may
manifest an aggressive or violent attitude while others may stalk away or
cringe in mute fearful attitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any
rate, in the instant case, although <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> testified
that the rape was accompanied by the screams and struggles of the girl, the
mere sight of sex and naked bodies would be sufficient to excite his
sensibilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the sum, appellants seek to impugn the credibility of the
prosecution's witnesses by pointing out inconsistencies in the testimonies of
the two (2) principal witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
settled, long-standing rule where the issues raised hinge on the credibility of
witnesses is for the appellate tribunal to give due respect to the assessment
of facts made by the lower court,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
said court having had the opportunity, not only of receiving the evidence, but
also of observing the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
This rule should not be overturned unless there is a showing that in making the
disputed factual findings, the trial court has overlooked or failed to consider
certain facts of weight and importance that could have materially affected the
conclusion reached in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is no positive reason that would
justify a reversal of the rule, the inconsistencies pointed as such appearing
to be more apparent than real and absent any showing of motive that would have
impelled the prosecution witnesses to testify falsely against appellants who are
being indicted for a very serious and grave offense which might possibly send
them to the execution chamber.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 15pt 0.5in; text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.2in;">II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>On the second assignment of error</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants state that the trial court erred in its findings of
fact of the case, the same being directly and clearly in conflict with the
evidence adduced at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prop
this stance, appellants make an issue of the fact that the medico-legal
certificate showed no findings of abrasions around the vaginal cleft, or
spermatozoa inside the vagina thus negating the lower court's finding that rape
was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants are in error.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Cesario</span> Salazar</u>,
L-37701, October 30, 1979, where the appellant therein likewise emphasized the
impossibility of the commission of the crime of rape because the medical
certificate indicated that the hymen was negative for laceration or tear and
the vaginal smear is negative for <span class="SpellE">spermatocytes</span>, We
ruled that the absence of lacerations, abrasions or rashes in the genital organ
of the victim that would indicate forcible sexual intercourse cannot definitely
be a basis for concluding that a woman did not have sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As We said in the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Canastre</span></u>, 82 Phil. 480, 483, "it is hard to
believe that a young unmarried girl would make such a revelation and allow an
examination of her private parts and thereafter permit herself to be the
subject even of a public trial, if she was not motivated solely by a desire to
have the culprits apprehended and punished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the persuasive weight of this circumstance is such as to negative
the importance of the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Parreñas</span> to
the effect that there were no lacerations, abrasions or rashes in the genital
organ of <span class="SpellE">Benedicta</span> that indicated forcible sexual
intercourse."</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor will the absence of <span class="SpellE">spermatocytes</span>
from the specimen taken from the complainant's vaginal canal disprove the
commission of the crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
important factor is not emission of the semen, but penetration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule in this jurisdiction
that any <span style="">penetration, however slight,
and whether reaching the hymen or not, is sufficient to constitute the crime of
rape.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants also assert
that error was committed by </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">lower court in considering as evidence of the
force committed on the person of complainant the abrasions found on her arms
and waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stress the point that
they found complainant lying on a wooden catwalk dead drunk and the abrasions
on her body could have been caused by her falling on the ground.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants' assertion
finds no factual basis on the records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No evidence whatsoever appears in the records to </span>show <span style="">that Rosie de Villa ever sustained a fall,
apart from the rape incident in question, at any time before she was medically
examined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellants merely infer
the same from their allegation that they found her "lying on a wooden
catwalk" before they boarded her on the taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This allegation not having been proven during
the trial deserves no merit or consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Conversely, Dr. Vicente
C. <span class="SpellE">Bacay</span>, another expert witness presented by the
defense, on cross-examination, testified that the aforementioned abrasions
found on the body of the complaining witness are vital findings which indicate
that rape was committed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you also testify in the examination in
chief that the first thing you do in the examination of the victim after
securing her consent to the examination is to look for certain injury ...
suffered on her person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
particular case wherein the medical certificate issued by the attending
physician there appears to be abrasions ... is that not one of the signs of
rape which you have stated in your examination in chief?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I
said this is a vital finding in cases of rape especially those which are extra genital
injury which an examining physician found is fresh in appearance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is extra
genital?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
we mean <span style="">by </span><span style="">extra genital, </span>it does not mean it is

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, affirm as correct the finding of the trial court
that the complaining witness sustained the aforementioned multiple abrasions on
her arms and on her waist, which took five days to heal <span style="">as </span>per medical certificate, Exhibit "E", by reason of
the force and violence inflicted upon her in the consummation of the multiple

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in considering
against them the aggravating circumstances of "nighttime" and
"uninhabited place".</p>

<p class="BODY">To buttress their particular stance that nighttime should not be
considered against them, appellants maintain that the prosecution has not
adduced evidence to prove that accused had planned to commit the alleged rape
at the date and time of the incident; that no less than the complainant
admitted she just met the accused; that <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> is
not necessarily an aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime; and
where it is not evident that the defendant purposely sought night<span style="">time, such circumstance should not prejudice
the defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The law provides that
there are three (3) elements to be taken into account before the aggravating
circumstance of nighttime and uninhabited place may be considered, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When it facilitated the commission of the
crime; or</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When especially sought for by the offender;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to
nighttime, the evidence adduced in the case at bar does not show that the scene
or place of alleged crime facilitated commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, there were houses within
the 50-meter </span>radius and that there were plenty of cars passing along and
continuously illuminating the scene or place of alleged crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, accused could not have sought nighttime in committing
the alleged crime if their purpose was to avoid being recognized or to save
themselves against detection because it is clear from the evidence that the
place where the alleged rape was committed was only four (4) meters from the
road and there were plenty of cars passing at the time of alleged crime.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants also strongly
vociferate against the trial court's considering "uninhabited place"
as an aggravating circumstance in the commission of the alleged crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend that there is more than
sufficient evidence and based on the testimony itself for the prosecution that
the Tourist Spot or the place where the alleged rape was committed is not
uninhabited because of the following facts established and <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Matbagon</span></u>, 60 Phil.
888, 893, which was decided as early as 12 November 1934, the Supreme Court
laid down the doctrine that <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> should be
considered as an aggravating circumstance only when it appeared that it was
especially sought by the offender or that he had taken advantage thereof in
order to facilitate the commission of the crime or for the purpose of

state that <u>taking advantage of nighttime in order to facilitate the

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the accused neither sought the nighttime
nor took advantage of it to commit the crime with greater facility or to
escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had hidden behind the tree
and attacked the deceased without warning or availed <span class="GramE">himself</span>

circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If the accused in this
case did not take advantage of the nighttime to commit the crime or to escape,
then the darkness did not facilitate the commission of the offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To take advantage of a fact or circumstance
in committing a crime clearly implies an intention to do so, and one does not
avail himself of the darkness unless one intended to do so</u>." (Italics
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Of equal relevance is the

<blockquote>"The lower court appreciated <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>
against the appellants solely on the basis of the fact on record that the crime
was committed at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular finding
can stand correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By and of itself,
nighttime is not an aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It becomes so only when it is especially sought by the offender and
taken advantage of by him to facilitate the commission of the crime to insure
his immunity from capture (People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span>, 46 Phil.
739; People v. <span class="SpellE">Matbagon</span>, 60 Phil. 887; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>, 79 Phil. 658).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated differently, in default of any showing or evidence that the
peculiar advantages of nighttime was purposely and deliberately sought by the
accused, the fact that the offense was committed at night will not suffice to
sustain <span class="SpellE"><u>nocturnidad</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must concur with the intent or design of
the offender to capitalize on the intrinsic impunity afforded by the darkness
of night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case presently on appeal, <span class="GramE">We</span> note
that other than the time of the crime, nothing else whatsoever suggests the
aggravating circumstance of nighttime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not one of the prosecution evidence, oral or documentary, makes the
slightest indication that the protection of night's darkness was deliberately
availed of by the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of
this deficiency in the case for the Government, We are constrained to disallow
the said circumstance even as technically, it may have been accepted by them
when they pleaded guilty on arraignment."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above ruling that <span class="SpellE"><u>nocturnidad</u></span> (to be appreciated as an aggravating
circumstance) "must concur with the intent or design of the offender to

<p class="BODY">It is thus succinctly clear that absent any showing that the
accused in the case at bar took advantage of nighttime in order to facilitate the
commission of the crime of rape and failure of the prosecution to demonstrate
that the accused intended to capitalize on the intrinsic impunity afforded by
the darkness of the night, the appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of
nighttime against the three accused must necessarily fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Uninhabited place is aggravating when the crime is committed in a
solitary place, where help to the victim is difficult and escape of the accused
is easy, provided that solitude was purposely sought or taken advantage of to
facilitate the commission of the felony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Laoto</span></u>,
52 Phil. 402, the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place which the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> appreciated against the accused was rejected by Us <span style="">for </span>the reason that from the house of
the deceased, "the place where the boat was could be seen, and his voice
could be heard therein."</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place was
not accepted in the case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span></u>,
55 Phil. 610, as there was lack of evidence to show that the appellant sought
the solitude of the place in order to better attain his purpose and that the
place where the crime was committed was about 1 kilometer away from the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Deguia</span></u>, 88
Phil. 520 also repudiated the appreciation of uninhabited place against the
accused even when the nearest house to that of the offended party was 1 kilometer
away because the appellants did not select the place where to better attain
their objective without interference, or to secure themselves against detection
and punishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing decisions and in the presence of <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> evidence that the alleged scene of the
offense is not uninhabited, there rises the inevitable conclusion that the
aggravating circumstance of uninhabited place cannot be considered against the
three accused-appellants in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants contend that the trial court erred in convicting them of
rape as charged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, the evidence on
record not being sufficient to prove <span style="">the
essential elements of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
contend that, upon the evidence presented, the element of carnal knowledge has
not been established so as to support a conviction beyond any reasonable doubt
for not only were the testimonies of the principal prosecution witnesses
contradictory and improbable but </span><span style="">that
</span><span style="">complainant herself admits (a)
she was not conscious of what was going on at the time of the alleged rape; (b)
she did not notice any ejaculation; and (c) she was drunk at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, appellants assert that while it is
true that in cases of rape rupturing of the hymen is not indispensable for
conviction, it is, however, essential that there must be proof of some degree
of entrance of the male organ within the labia of the pudendum and this, the
prosecution clearly failed to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants maintain that the prosecution should establish the essential
requisites of rape by clear and positive evidence not on inferences or dubious
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Refuting the assertion of appellants, the Solicitor General
emphatically states that all the elements of the crime of multiple <span class="GramE">rape</span> have been proved beyond reasonable doubt against the
appellants, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">That the three appellants, <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Clark, Julius Clark, and Jose <span class="SpellE">Coderes</span> had carnal
knowledge of Rosie de Villa, in succession and helping one another, employing
force and intimidation, and against the consent of the complaining
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid repetitious arguments,
they adopt their refutations to the first and second assignments of error in
support of their stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the number of crimes committed by the appellants, each and <span class="GramE">everyone</span> of them committed, and are guilty of three crimes
of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each of them is responsible,
not only for the act of rape committed by the others, because each one of them
cooperated in the consummation <span style="">of the
rape committed by the others, by acts without which it could not have been
accomplished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regards to the participation of <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Clark, the complaining witness testified that he was the first one who raped
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>
testified that he did <span style="">not see him do
anything to the girl means that he did not see him rape her because at that
time, </span><span style="">he </span>was still on <span style="">his </span><span style="">way up to the Tourist Spot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, it took him around 30 minutes to reach the place
because he was afraid, and he took precautionary measures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not <span class="GramE">true,</span>
however, that <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> stated that <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
was not around while Julius and Jose were having intercourse with the girl, as
appellants stated in their brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> stated that he did not see <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span>
Clark because of the tall grasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
only saw him when the two other appellants moved and he went closer to the
girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the contention of the
Solicitor General, therefore, and to this <span class="GramE">We</span> give our
stamp of approval, that <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> Clark is as guilty as
his co-appellants herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General points to the existence of the generic
aggravating circumstance of use of a motor vehicle which although not stated in
the information was not objected to by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that the accused brought the
complaining witness to Tourist Spot in a taxicab.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was established by their declarations in
court and also in their own admissions (pp. 94-98, 126-128, 147-149, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="3">4 March
 1971</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of the motor
vehicle facilitated the taking of the victim and her subsequent rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the said aggravating circumstance
should and must be considered and appreciated against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, 60 Phil. 610; People vs. Cruz, 85 Phil. 577;

find that the generic aggravating circumstance of use of motor vehicle is
present in the case and may be taken into account in the imposition of the
penalty to the maximum period, absent any mitigating circumstance to offset the
same.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resume, We fully agree and, therefore, affirm the guilt and <span style="">conviction </span>beyond reasonable doubt of

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of record, to my mind, has not established the guilt
of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony of the main eyewitness, Jose <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>,
Jr. who took his time witnessing the two rapes allegedly committed by the
roadside one after the other (and whose sensibilities were excited "by the
<span style="">mere </span>sight of <span style="">sex </span>and naked bodies")<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
before dramatically charging down the scene firing his gun three times in the
air to apprehend the protagonists, is undeserving of credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant in turn was admittedly in an
intoxicated state and not conscious of what was going on at the time of the
alleged triple rape<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,
while her physical examination by the attending physician after the incident
was <u>negative</u> of her having had "recent sexual contact"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and of any abrasions or evidence of force as claimed by her.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
All this, plus evidence of some collusion and "intimate relations"
between the complainant and her eyewitness to the rapes, <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
entitle the accused to the benefit of the doubt and to an acquittal.</p>
