				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for </span><span style="">"<i>certiorari</i> </span><span style="">and </span><i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style="">" </span><span style="">filed on 3 September 1992 urging us to render
judgment:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(1)  Declaring the 1st Indorsement dated 14
December 1990 of the respondent Secretary of Science and Technology, (Annex
"E" hereof), and Resolution No. 91-1036 of the respondent Civil
Service Commission, (Annex "G" hereof) null and void;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (2)  Ordering the respondent Secretary of Science and Technology to pay the
back wages of the petitioner for the period from April 16, 1988, the date she
was illegally dismissed, to June 14, 1989, the date she was reinstated; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>  (3)  Ordering the respondent Secretary of Science and Technology to pay the
petitioner the salary equivalent to the salary of a Planning Assistant from the
time of her reinstatement and thenceforward."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In their comment filed by the Office of the Solicitor General for
the respondents on 2 December 1992, the respondents claim that the petitioner
received a copy of respondent Civil Service Commission's (CSC) Resolution No.
91-1036 of 29 August 1991 on 5 September 1991 and pray that the petition be
dismissed because, on procedural grounds, it was filed out of time and the
petitioner violated paragraph 4 of Revised Circular No. 1-88 and Circular No. 28-91;
and, on substantive grounds, the decision in G.R. No. 81495 of 4 June 1990<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot apply to her since she is not a party therein.  Moreover, her position was legally abolished, she did not appeal
from the abolition, and instead of joining her other co-employees in assailing
the legality of their separation from the service, she requested appointment to
<span style="">a </span>position comparable to her
former position.  Thus, she was
appointed to the position of Clerk II on 15 May 1989, which she accepted
without reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the petitioner failed to comply with the aforesaid
Circulars.  She does not also deny that
she received a copy of the challenged Resolution No. 91-1036 on 5 September
1991.  Pursuant to Section 7,
subdivision A (Common Provisions), Article IX of the Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner had only thirty days from 5 September 1991 within which to bring
the said resolution to this Court via a petition for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>under
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
instant petition was filed only on 3 September 1992 or eleven months and
twenty-eight days after her receipt of a copy of the challenged resolution,
indisputably beyond the constitutionally mandated period.  On this score alone, the petition must be
dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even on its merits, the petition must likewise fail.  The uncontroverted facts culled from the
pleadings’ of the parties, as well as from our decision of 4 June 1990 in <i><span style="">Mendoza vs. Quisumbing</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and companion cases, render this
conclusion inevitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before 16 April 1988, the petitioner held the position of
Planning Assistant in the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI), an
agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), with an annual
salary of P26,250.40.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 January 1987, the President of the Philippines issued E.O.
No. 128 reorganizing the <span style="">DOST.  </span>Section 21 thereof provides for the
reorganization of the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and the
PNRI.  Conformably therewith, PNRI was
reorganized and a new staffing pattern or position structure, which abolished
certain positions, was adopted.  A list
of employees who would be retained under the new position structure was posted
in the PNRI premises.  Those excluded
were placed in a manpower pool for possible placements in other DOST
agencies.  Appointments under the new
position structure were thereafter issued to the retained employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the abolished positions was that of the petitioner.  The petitioner, however, "made an
appeal with the DOST/RAB to place her to any comparable position to which her
qualification would fit,"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> which
was favorably <span style="">acted upon </span>by her
appointment to the new position of Clerk II with an annual salary of P17,640.00
on 15 May 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
She accepted her appointment as Clerk II, a position she presently holds.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of our Decision of 4 June 1990 in <i><span style="">Mendoza vs. Quisumbing</span></i><span style=""> </span>and more particularly of the
companion case, G.R. No. 81495 <span style="">(<i>Arizabal
vs. Leviste</i>), </span>wherein we held:</p>

<blockquote>"4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 81495, the petition is
DISMISSED.  Except in the cases of those
who have retired or opted to be phased out and who have received their
separation and retirement benefits, the petitioners are ordered to retain the
private respondents-employees in the reorganized department under the new
staffing pattern with positions and salaries comparable or equivalent to their
former positions but not lower than their former ranks and salaries."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the petitioner (who was neither a party
in G.R. No. 81495 nor <span style="">in </span>the
case before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City subject thereof) sent a
letter to the Director of the PNRI, dated 3 September 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
requesting the payment of back salaries for the period commencing from the
abolition of her office until she was appointed as Clerk II and the payment of
salary "comparable or equivalent to her former position as Planning
Assistant from the time she was phased out up to the present." The PNRI
referred this request to the DOST on 12 November 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In a 1st Indorsement dated 14 December 1990,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the DOST denied the request because she was not a party in G.R. No. 81495 and
because there was no finding under Section 9 of R.A. No. 6656 (Reorganization
Law) that the petitioner was illegally terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 March 1991, the petitioner, through counsel, sent a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
to the public respondent CSC requesting that in view of the DOST denial of her
request, the CSC should "order the PNRI to pay Ms. Manalo back wages
during the period she was phased out up to her reinstatement to the lower
position of Clerk II, and, in addition that she be paid the difference between
the salary of a Planning Assistant and that of a Clerk II."</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Resolution No. 91-1036 of 29 August 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the CSC denied the request because the petitioner was not a party in G.R. No.
81495, and although the position of Clerk II is admittedly lower in rank and
salary than her previous position of Planning Assistant, upon her request after
she had been phased out, she assumed the duties of Clerk II without
reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">From these facts, it is clear that both the indorsement and the
resolution were not issued with abuse, much less grave, of discretion.  The petitioner was not compelled to accept
the new position.  Instead of
questioning the new position structure or taking the other alternatives of
either accepting separation pay or retiring from the service, she expressed
preference for appointment to the new position, voluntarily accepted the
appointment thereto, and assumed the new position without reservation.  Reluctance or involuntariness in relation
thereto is not asserted in her petition and in her letters of 3 September 1990
and 4 March 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>aspect of this case refers to the
payment of the petitioner's (a) "back wages ... for the period from April
16, 1988, the date she was illegally dismissed, to June 14, 1989, the date she
was reinstated," and (b) "salary equivalent to the salary of a
Planning Assistant from the time of her reinstatement and thenceforward."</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><span style="">Mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
is a special civil action available to an aggrieved party when any tribunal,
corporation, board, or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act
which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust,
or station, or unlawfully excludes a person from the use and enjoyment of a
right or office to which that person is entitled, and there is no other plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.  The petitioner's claim for "back
wages" could be the appropriate subject of an ordinary civil action and
there is absolutely no showing that the said remedy is not plain, speedy and
adequate.  It does not even seem that
the petitioner has given some priority to her claim.  She did not claim for it in her 3 September 1990 letter to the
PNRI.  The first time she mentioned it
was in her 4 March 1991 letter to the CSC.  Thereafter, and before she filed this petition, she did nothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the payment of salary equivalent to that of a Planning
Assistant, it is clear that the petitioner does not seek reinstatement to the
position of Planning Assistant.  Since
she <span style="">had in fact asked for her retention
in the PNRI and for her appointment to a new position and was accordingly
appointed as Clerk II, a position which she voluntarily accepted and which she
continues to hold until now, estoppel, which is clearly present, bars her
obtainment of the desired relief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">are not persuaded by the suggestion that the
petitioner is only seeking execution of the decision in </span><i><span style="">Arizabal vs. Leviste</span></i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">The petitioner is not a party therein and is
not, therefore, entitled to its execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nor do we agree with the plea
in the dissenting opinion that we take this case as one for </span><i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">in the light of our
decision in </span><i><span style="">Cristobal vs.
Melchor</span></i><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The
factual milieu therein does not obtain in this case.  Unlike Cristobal who was never reinstated despite his persistent pleas,
the herein petitioner asked for and was appointed to the new position of Clerk
II, which she accepted without reservation.  In </span><i><span style="">Cristobal</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">this Court considered the viability of an action for </span><i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">and the grant of
favorable relief thereunder even if the said action was filed after one year
from the accrual of the cause of action, because it was the "act of the
government through its responsible officials more particularly then Executive
Secretary Amelito Mutuc and his successors which contributed to the alleged
delay </span><span style="">in the filing </span><span style="">of Cristobal's … complaint for
reinstatement."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">It
</span><span style="">appeared therein that Cristobal
and the other dismissed employees were assured by Executive Secretary Mutuc
that he would work for their reinstatement; however, Mr. Mutuc was replaced by
other Executive Secretaries to whom Cristobal "over and over again
presented his request for reinstatement and who gave the same assurance that
Cristobal would be recalled and re-employed at the 'opportune time.'" This
"continued promise of government officials concerned led Cristobal to bide
his time and wait for the Office of the President to comply with its
commitment."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Even granting that the
petitioner can avail herself of the writ of </span><i>mandamus</i>, we <span style="">find no special or cogent reason to justify
acceptance of this petition as an exception to this Court's policy concerning
the hierarchy of courts in relation to cases where it has concurrent
jurisdiction with the Regional Trial Court and the Court of Appeals.  In </span><i>People vs. Cuaresma</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">this Court stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A last word.  This court's original jurisdiction to issue
writs of <i>certiorari</i> (as well as prohibition, <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style="">, <i>quo
warranto, habeas corpus</i> </span>and injunction) is not exclusive.  It is shared by this Court with Regional
Trial Courts (formerly Courts of First Instance), which may issue the writ,
enforceable in any part of their respective regions.  It is also shared by this court, and by the Regional Trial Court,
with the Court of Appeals (formerly, Intermediate Appellate Court), although
prior to the effectivity of <i><span style="">Batas
Pambansa Bilang 129</span></i><span style=""> on </span>August
14, 1981, the latter's competence to issue the extraordinary writs was
restricted by those ‘in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.' This concurrence of
jurisdiction is not, however, to be taken as according to parties seeking any
of the writs an absolute, unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to which
application therefor will be directed.  There is after all a hierarchy of courts.  That hierarchy is determinative of the venue of appeals, and
should also serve as a general determinant of the appropriate forum for
petitions for the extraordinary writs.  A becoming regard for that judicial hierarchy most certainly indicates
that petitions for the issuance of extraordinary writs against first level ('inferior')
courts should be filed with the Regional Trial Court, and those against the
latter, with the Court of Appeals.  A
direct invocation of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue these
writs should be allowed only when there are special and important reasons
therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition.  This is established policy.  It is a policy that is necessary to prevent
inordinate demands upon the Court's time and attention which are better devoted
to those matters within its exclusive jurisdiction, and to prevent further
over-crowding of the Court's docket.  Indeed, the removal of the restriction of the jurisdiction of the Court
of Appeals in this regard, <i>supra</i> -- resulting from the deletion of the
qualifying phrase, 'in aid of its appellate jurisdiction' -- was evidently
intended precisely to relieve this Court <i>pro tanto</i> of the burden of
dealing with applications for extraordinary writs which, but for the expansion
of the Appellate Court's corresponding jurisdiction, would have had to be filed
with it." (citations omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">And in <i>Defensor-Santiago vs. Vasquez</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"One final observation.  We discern in the proceedings <span style="">in
</span>this case a propensity on the part of petitioner, and, for that matter,
the same may be said of a number of litigants who initiate recourses before us,
to disregard the hierarchy of courts in our judicial system by seeking relief
directly from this Court despite the fact that the same is available in the
lower courts in the exercise of their original or concurrent jurisdiction, or
is even mandated by law to be sought therein.  This practice must be stopped, not only because of the imposition upon
the precious time of this Court but also because of the inevitable and
resultant delay, intended or otherwise, in the adjudication of the case which
often has to be remanded or referred to the lower court as the proper forum
under the rules of procedure, or as better equipped to resolve the issues since
this Court is not a trier of facts.  We,
therefore, reiterate the judicial policy that this Court will not entertain
direct resort to it unless the redress desired cannot be obtained in the
appropriate courts or where exceptional and compelling circumstances justify
availment of a remedy within and calling for the exercise of our primary
jurisdiction."</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BELLOSILLO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur subject to my <i><span style="">ponencia
</span></i>in <i><span style="">Aldovino v. ALunan</span></i><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>I will explain.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the dissent of Mr. Justice Kapunan that the
declaration of nullity of the assailed reorganizations in <i>Arizabal v.
Leviste</i><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
nullified also <span style="">in </span>effect the
separation of petitioner from the service; hence, theoretically, she could not
be deemed to have been terminated.  However, her act of signing up for another position, albeit lower,
within the same office amounted to an abdication of her right to hold her
former position.  In other words,
despite her separation, petitioner remained, in legal contemplation, as
incumbent Planning Assistant of DOST.  But the effect of her unqualified assumption as Clerk II is resignation
from her former office as she cannot be holding both offices at the same time.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, it appears from the statement of facts of the
majority opinion that after the reorganization, petitioner never questioned her
removal until the decision in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style="">.  </span>She
seemed contended with what fate befell her.  Before then, there was no indication whatsoever that she resented her
separation.  She assumed the position of
Clerk II without any condition or qualification; neither did she express
interest in her reinstatement as Planning Assistant.  Her actuation is indicum that she "opted to be phased
out," to use the language of <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style="">.  </span>Consequently,
she is not entitled to reinstatement to her former position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her situation is far different from that of most petitioners and
intervenors in <i><span style="">Aldovino </span></i>who,
from the start of their separation, unceasingly fought for their positions and
demanding reinstatement, although in different fora - some administratively,
others judicially and extra-judicially.  The ruling in <i><span style="">Cristobal v.
Melchor</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>cannot save her as it should only be
applied sparingly and only in extreme cases of injustice.  Her case is not one of them.  She does not appear to be a victim of
injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY">I also vote for the denial of the petition.</p>

<blockquote>4)  In G.R. No. 81495, the petition is
DISMISSED.  Except in the cases of those
who have retired or opted to be phased out and who have received their
separation and retirement benefits, the petitioners are ordered to retain the
private respondents-employees in the reorganized department under the new
staffing pattern with positions and salaries comparable or equivalent to their
former positions but not lower than their former ranks and salaries.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The clear import of our decisions in these consolidated cases was
that <u>without exception</u> 1) <i><span style="">all</span></i><span style=""> </span>the reorganizations embodied in the
consolidated cases were set aside, and; 2) in cases where it was plainly
impossible and impracticable to comply with our holding in <i>Mendoza</i>, we
allowed a modification of our holding, provided those affected were restored <i>to
</i><i><span style="">positions of similar rank and
salary, if said employees </span>did </i><i><span style="">not opt for retirement or separation</span></i><span style="">.  </span>Even assuming that petitioner
allowed to have her name placed in a manpower pool for purposes of being
assigned to another job, consistent with this Court's holding in Arizabal vs
Leviste, equity demands that she should have been automatically reassigned to a
position both of comparable rank <u>and</u> salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">A lot has been said about the fact that herein petitioner was not
among the original private respondents in G.R. No. 81495.  Considering our decision in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>and the subsequent case, <i><span style="">De Guzman v. CSC, infra, </span></i>her failure to join the petitioners
in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>was not fatal to her petition for
reinstatement and back salaries.  In <i><span style="">Cristobal vs. Melchor</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the doctrine of laches was
invoked to defeat the petitioner's demand for reinstatement to his former
position with the Office of the President, this Court held the statute of
limitations (provided for in Section 16, Rule 66, of the Rules of Court)
inapplicable because there was no acquiescence or inaction on the part of
Cristobal which would amount to an abandonment of his right to
reinstatement.  Addressing the
contention that he was not one of the parties to the civil case and could not
benefit from the lower court's decision in the said civil case, we held that:</p>

<blockquote><u>Cristobal was not one of the plaintiffs in the civil case, it is
true, but his non-participation is not fatal to his cause of action</u>
(Emphasis ours).  During the pendency of
the civil case Cristobal continued to press his request for reinstatement
together with the other employees who had filed the complaint and was in fact
promised reinstatement as will be shown more in detail later.</blockquote>

<blockquote>More importantly, Cristobal could be expected - without necessarily
spending time and money by going to court - to rely upon the outcome <span style="">of </span>the case filed by his co-employees
to protect his interests considering the similarity of his situation to that of
the plaintiffs therein and the identical relief being sought.  On this point, We find a statement of
Justice Louis Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court in <i>Southern
Pacific vs. Bogert</i>, relevant and persuasive, and We quote:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The essence of laches is not merely lapse of time.  It is essential that there be also
acquiescence in the alleged wrong or lack of diligence in seeking a
remedy.  Here plaintiffs, or others

ever since they have <span style="">x x x </span>persisted
in the diligent pursuit of <span style="">a remedy </span><i>x

is of such a nature that a suit to enforce it would be brought on behalf, not
only of the plaintiff, but of all persons similarly situated, it is not

order that he be deemed thereafter free from the laches which bars those who
sleep on their rights</i>.  <span style="">(250 U.S. 483, 39 S. Ct. 536, 63 L. Ed. 1099,

<p class="BODY">Significantly, <span style="">in <i>Cristobal</i>,
</span>the plaintiff filed his complaint for reinstatement on August 10, 1971
or more than nine (9) years after his services as private secretary in the
President's Private Office were terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The similarity in the circumstances of the petitioner and the
private respondents in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>and our ruling in <i><span style="">Cristobal</span></i><span style=""> militates </span>against public respondents' assertion that petitioner
herein could not benefit from our decision in the former case.  Furthermore, we did not limit our holding in
the <i><span style="">Mendoza </span></i><i><span style="">and Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>cases only to the petitioners <span style="">therein.  </span><i>The decision was obviously broad enough </i><i><span style="">to </span>include all of those employees affected
by the reorganizations we set aside in those consolidated </i><i><span style="">cases</span></i><span style=""> </span>such that 1) reinstatement should have been automatic, and; 2)
it was not essential that petitioner should have intervened in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>or joined the other PNRI employees in assailing the legality of
their separation, for her to benefit from our holding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's demotion to a mere Clerk II position with a salary
of P17,640.00 from that of Planning Assistant II with compensation of
P26,250.00 and the respondents' failure to rectify this situation were clearly
in blatant contravention of both the letter and spirit of our orders in <i><span style="">Mendoza </span></i><i><span style="">and Arizabal.</span></i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With due respect, I cannot simply reconcile myself with the
majority's rationalization that <span style="">petitioner
was not </span>compelled to accept the new position, that instead of
questioning the new position structure or taking the alternative of separation
or retirement, she expressed preference for the new position and voluntarily
accepted appointment thereto.  On April
16, 1988 petitioner was removed from her earlier job as a result of the PNRI
reorganization.  She was unemployed for
fourteen months.  On June 15, 1989, she
accepted a Clerk II position with a salary considerably less than the one which
was abolished as result of the new staffing structure.  From these circumstances, one <span style="">can </span>hardly assume that she accepted
the unconscionable demotion "voluntarily." She did not have much
choice.  It was an option between the
degradation of having to accept a lowly position with a salary reduced by more than
one third and the pangs of hunger out of joblessness, at a time when heads of
government departments and agencies were engaged in their orgy of throwing out
from office hordes of government workers in the guise of reorganization,
running roughshod on their rights of due process and security of tenure.  In her unfortunate plight, petitioner, like
the dismissed clerk in <i><span style="">Cristobal</span></i><span style=""> </span>who did not have the luxury, time and
money to go to court to protect his rights, must also have relied on the
outcome of the case filed by her co-employees, given the similarity of her
situation to that of theirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">As I see it, the majority opinion assumes that this case merely
involves the validity of final orders of the Civil Service Commission on the
separation, removal or termination of a public officer.  I beg to disagree.  The issue brought before us affects the extent to which DOST has
complied with our decision (in <i>Mendoza</i>) setting aside the
reorganizations involving these government agencies and our holding (in <i>Arizabal</i>)
directing petitioners in G.R. No. 81495 to reinstate their employees to
positions of similar rank and salary.  Such being the case, it would be inappropriate, in my mind, to misdirect
our attention to petitioner's failure to comply with procedural steps relating
to the the CSC's order, rather than on the results of the abolition of the
office itself.  That would be mistaking
the trees for the forest.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no disagreement on the proposition that a valid
abolition of an office is neither a separation nor a removal.  Where, however, the abolition is void, the
incumbent is deemed never to have ceased to hold office.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> In <i><span style="">Cruz vs. Primicias</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the validity of the
reorganization of provincial departments in the Province of Pangasinan was
assailed by government employees terminated as a result of abolition of their
offices, the Court, said:</p>

<blockquote>No removal or separation of petitioners from service is here
involved, but the validity of the abolition of their offices.  This is a legal question that is for the
Courts to decide.  It is a well-known
rule also that a valid abolition of offices is neither removal or separation of
the <span style="">incumbents.  </span><i>And of course, if the abolition is
void the incumbent is deemed never </i><i><span style="">to
</span>have ceased </i><i><span style="">to </span>hold
office</i>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>As well settled is the rule that the abolition of an office does
not amount to an illegal removal of its incumbent is the principle that, in
order to be valid, the abolition must be made in good faith.  Where the abolition is made in bad faith,
for political and personal reasons, or in order to circumvent the
constitutional security of tenure of civil service employees, it is null and
void.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">One of the points raised by the respondents in <i><span style="">Primicias</span></i><span style=""> </span>to defeat the petitioners' challenge against the validity of
the abolition of their offices was precisely a procedural point:  their failure to exhaust administrative
remedies.  In laying the question to
rest, the Court emphasized that the petitioners therein never actually ceased
to hold office if the abolition was null and void.  Being null and void, their failure to exhaust available
administrative remedies was clearly beside the point.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As recently as March 11,

<blockquote>An abolition which is not <u>bona fide</u> but is merely a device
to circumvent the constitutional security of tenure of the civil service

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, therefore, the effect of our decision in
the above-cited consolidated cases and in <i><span style="">De Guzman</span></i><span style=""> </span>was
to bring back those employees adversely affected by these reorganizations as
far as practicable to the <i><span style="">status quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>on the day their positions were
abolished.  Consequently, as petitioner
is deemed never to have ceased to hold office, it follows that the appealed
decisions of the DOST and the Civil Service Commission have no practical force
and effect, to begin with.  By operation
of law, she was entitled to all the rights and privileges which accrued to her
by virtue of the office she held.  Her
failure to appeal the respondent Commission's decision within the thirty-day
period required by the Constitution was, therefore, immaterial because in the
eyes of the law, her entitlement to the position of Planning Assistant (or to
an equivalent one) and to the emoluments and privileges attached to the same
had never actually ceased.  From a practical
point of view, her initial request for reinstatement to the position of
Planning Assistant II, <u>was in effect a request for compliance with our
earlier orders in the </u><i><u><span style="">Mendoza
</span></u></i><u>and </u><i><u><span style="">Arizabal</span></u></i><u><span style=""> </span>cases</u>.  The DOST's refusal to comply with the said orders, its failure to
restore petitioner to the <i><span style="">status quo</span></i><span style="">, </span>and the CSC's Resolution of 29 August
1991 were therefore made in excess of respondents' jurisdiction.  <u>Compliance with our decision ordering the
public officials concerned to restore employees affected by the reorganization
of the PNRI to the</u> <i><span style="">status quo</span></i><span style=""> </span><u>as far as practicable in </u><i><u><span style="">Arizabal vs. Leviste</span></u></i><u><span style=""> </span>was not discretionary</u>, but made
obligatory by our orders in the <i><span style="">Mendoza</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion has made much out of the petitioner's
failure to comply with Article IX of the Constitution requiring that such
petitions be filed within thirty days from receipt of the assailed resolutions,
and Circular I-88 which requires a verified statement of material dates in
these petitions.  As we had already made
a clear and unequivocal pronouncement in <i><span style="">Arizabal</span></i><span style=""> </span>to
restore the illegally dismissed employees to positions comparable or equivalent
to those they formerly held, "but not lower than their former ranks and
salaries" (except in the cases of those who have retired or opted to be
phased out and who have received their separation and retirement benefits), the
only thing left to do for DOST was to implement or execute the directive.  Petitioner's recourse to CSC from the
adverse ruling of DOST was a superfluity as petitioner could have come to this
Court to execute or implement its final orders.  Hence, the prescriptive period mandated by Article IX of the 1987
Constitution could not have run.  Moreover, the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure mandates
that, as in <i><span style="">Mendoza vs. Quisumbing</span></i>
and the <i><span style="">Dario vs. Mison</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>cases, we disregard the procedural
roadblocks erected by the public respondent in order to defeat what is
otherwise a valid claim.  A much more
equitable result would have followed had we proceeded to treat the case at
bench essentially on its own merits, particularly when we consider that the
questioned delay in this case <b><span style="">was
even far less</span></b><span style=""> </span>than the
assailed delays in <i><span style="">Dario vs. Mison</span></i><span style=""> </span>and in the earlier case of <i><span style="">Cristobal vs. Melchor.</span></i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i><span style="">Dario</span></i><span style="">, </span>which <span style="">we </span>cited with favor in <i><span style="">Mendoza
vs. Quisumbing</span></i><span style="">, we </span>stated
that:</p>

<blockquote>The Court disregards the questions raised as to procedure... and
other technical objections, for two reasons, “[b]ecause of the demands of
public interest, including the need for stability in the public service... and
because of the serious implications of these cases on the administration of the
Philippine civil service and the rights of public servants.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Constitution, no less, demands a
similar treatment of the procedural roadblocks that stand in the way of petitioner's
valid claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to grant due course to the petition and to enter judgment
as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
