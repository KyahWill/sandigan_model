				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Evelyn Garcia <i>y </i>Delima was charged before the Regional
Trial Court of Cebu City in Criminal Case No. CBU-21653 with the violation of
Section 4, Article II of R.A. No. 6425 (the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972), as
amended, in an information<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> dated
16 April 1991, the accusatory portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 12th day of April, 1991, at about 12:30
P.M., in the City of Cebu, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the said accused, with deliberate intent, did then and there
sell and deliver, without authority of law, fifteen (15) sticks of marijuana
cigarettes, a prohibited drug, to a person who posted himself as buyer after
having received buy bust money in the amount of P20.00 bearing serial No.
KL518411.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was raffled off to Branch 5.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the requisite proceedings, the trial court promulgated on
24 January 1992 its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
finding the accused guilty as charged and sentencing her to suffer the penalty
of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P20,000.00<span style="">.  </span>It further ordered the
burning of the fifteen sticks of marijuana cigarettes in the presence of the
representatives of the Narcotics Command (NARCOM), the prosecution, and the
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced by the prosecution established that sometime
before 5 April 1991, the office of the NARCOM based in Cebu City received a
report from an informer that the accused, a resident of Lorega St., <span style="">Cebu </span>City, was engaged in the sale of
marijuana.  Acting upon this
information, Maj. Esa Hassan, commanding officer of the said office, instructed
Sgt. Basilio Sarong to conduct a surveillance on her.  On 5 April 1991, Sgt. Sarong, accompanied by the informer,
proceeded to the slum area of Lorega and upon arrival thereat, positioned
himself at the house of the informer's friend from where he had a clear view of
her hangout.  Peeping through a window,
Sgt. Sarong saw her selling marijuana to certain persons.  He then reported to Maj. Hassan her illegal
activity.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 April 1991, Sgt. Sarong conducted another surveillance on
the accused for the purpose of preparing for a buy-bust operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">His </span>surveillance yielded a
positive result, which he immediately reported to Maj. Hassan who then formed a
buy-bust team composed of Sgt. Sarong as the poseur buyer and Sgt. Eduardo
Misa, Sgt. Hermes Recla, and other NARCOM officers as members of the back-up
team.  Sgt. Sarong was provided with a
P20.00 marked bill (Exhibit "D") bearing serial number KL518411
(Exhibit "D-1") and containing the initials of Maj. Hassan (Exhibit
"D-2").<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 April 1991 at around 12:30 p.m., the members of the team
proceeded to Lorega Street.  Sgt. Sarong
went directly to the hangout of the accused while his companions strategically
posted themselves in a place where they could monitor Sgt. Sarong's movements.  When he entered the hangout, the accused
approached and asked him if he wanted to buy marijuana to which he answered
yes.  He gave her the marked P20.00
bill.  She told him to wait for a while
and then left.  When she came back, she
delivered to him fifteen sticks of marijuana cigarettes.  He opened one handrolled cigarette and
smelled it.  After ascertaining that it
was indeed marijuana, he gave the pre-­arranged signal (by scratching his head)
to his companions who immediately closed in and arrested her.  The team recovered from her the P20.00
marked bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was brought to their office for investigation.  The fifteen sticks of marijuana were given
to C1C Ceballos, the evidence custodian, who marked each cigarette and
conducted a field test which yielded a positive result for marijuana (Exhibit
"E").<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The fifteen sticks of marijuana were later sent to the <span style="">PNP </span>Crime Laboratory for examination (Exhibit "A") and
submitted to Lt. Myrna Areola, Chief Chemist, who examined the specimens and
found the same positive for marijuana (Exhibit "C").<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused denied the prosecution's story and
claimed that at about 12:30 p.m. of 12 April 1991, she was in her house playing
bingo with her mother, Teresita, and her neighbors.  A man approached her, suddenly placed his arms around her
shoulders, and led her to a road forty meters away from her house.  She did not hesitate to go with him because
she thought that the man was her friend or relative.  While on the road, another man alighted from the service vehicle
of the NARCOM and showed her some marijuana leaves wrapped in a piece of
paper.  When asked by the man if she had
marijuana, she replied in the negative and asserted that she had never seen a
marijuana in her life.  The man then
frisked her and took P55.00 from her pocket.  She was told to board the vehicle and was brought to the office of the
NARCOM.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Sgt. Hermes Recla declared that he was one of the
NARCOM officers who arrested the accused whom they caught selling fifteen
sticks of marijuana cigarettes to Sgt. Sarong.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> On
sur-rebuttal, the accused claimed that she had not seen Sgt. Hermes Recla at
the time she was arrested by the NARCOM officers but admitted that she does not
know of any reason why he would falsely charge her of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Insisting on her innocence, the accused appealed and in her
Appellant's Brief<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
imputes upon the trial court the commission of the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  IN FAILING TO NOTE THAT THE OBJECTS IN

<p class="BODY">The issue of the credibility of the witnesses confronted the
trial court.  It found "reasons to
believe and g[a]ve more credence to the categorical and clear testimonies of
the prosecution witnesses" because there was no iota of evidence that the
prosecution witnesses who are police officers were actuated by any improper
motive in charging the accused of a serious crime and testifying against her in
court.  It noted that she even admitted
that she had no misunderstanding with the NARCOM agents and could not think of
any possible motive why they would charge her with selling marijuana
cigarettes.  It ruled that the bare
denials she put up in her defense cannot prevail over the positive
identification made by the NARCOM agents and their affirmative testimonies, and
that her claim in her Memorandum that her arrest and search were illegal is
baseless for she was caught <i><span style="">in
flagrante</span></i><span style=""> </span>in a
buy-bust operation; hence, the law enforcers were not only authorized but were
under obligation to apprehend her even without a warrant of arrest and to
search her for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the
commission of the offense without a search warrant.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records and the evidence, we are
convinced that the trial court committed no error in its challenged decision.  We accept its assessment of the credibility
of the witnesses, an issue which is primarily addressed to it because it is in
a better position to resolve it, having heard the witnesses and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.  This assessment will not be disturbed on appeal unless there is a
showing (of which there is none here) that the trial court had overlooked,
misunderstood, or misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance
which would have affected the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence established with moral certainty that
the accused was caught <i><span style="">in flagrante</span></i><span style=""> </span>during a buy-bust operation.  She sold the marijuana cigarettes to the
poseur-buyer and accepted the consideration therefor -- the P20.00 marked bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment.  In entrapment, ways and means are resorted
to for the purpose of trapping and capturing law breakers in the execution of
their criminal plan.  It is a procedure
or operation sanctioned by law and which has consistently proved itself to be
an effective method of apprehending drug peddlers.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the members of the buy-bust
team were inspired by any improper motive or were not properly performing their
duty, their testimony on the operation deserves full faith and credit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused miserably failed to prove or even suggest, so as to
cast doubt on the credibility of the members of the buy-bust team, that any of them
had ulterior or sinister motives against her.  The conclusion then is inevitable that they performed their official
duty to eradicate, or at least diminish, the drug menace and arrest drug
pushers who have already wrought immeasurable destruction to society and to the
lives of many.  No improper motive
impelled their conduct of action.  The
law disputably presumes that official duty has been regularly performed.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In several drugs cases, this Court has repeatedly held that absent any proof to
the contrary, law enforcers are presumed to have regularly performed their
duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It is also settled that where there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that
a witness was actuated by improper motive, the presumption is that he was not
so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused's conviction then merits affirmance.  Nonetheless, for her satisfaction, we shall
take up <i><span style="">seriatim</span></i><span style=""> </span>her assignment of errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the first assigned error, she contends that:  (1) the fifteen sticks of marijuana
cigarettes and the marked P20.00 bill offered as exhibits have the
"earmarks of planted evidence" because the appearance of the
cigarettes presented during the trial is different from those allegedly
recovered by Sgt. Sarong:  the cigarettes
had no markings<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and "were not glued during the buy-bust operation and somewhat torn when
presented in evidence"; (2) as regards the marked bill, assuming that it
was actually retrieved from her possession, the NARCOM officers should have
issued a receipt to her and its recovery should have been reported in the
"records of the NARCOM"; and (3) Sgt. Sarong took out the marked bill
from his pocket while he was testifying, which is not proper considering that
it was presented in evidence in the preliminary investigation and made a part
of the records forwarded to the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.  In
the first place, she is not even certain if the exhibits were planted -- she
only claims that they have the "earmarks of planted evidence." In the
second place, as correctly pointed out by the appellee, the so-called
"earmarks" are merely the result of the normal handling of the
evidence.  After the buy-bust operation,
Sgt. Sarong handed the handrolled cigarettes to C1C Ceballos who marked the
cigarettes with the initials of the accused and conducted a field test.  C1C Ceballos then made a Certification of
Field Test.  Thereafter, they were sent
to the PNP Crime Laboratory for laboratory examination.  They were subsequently subjected to
extensive laboratory examination by Lt. Myrna Areola.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The non-issuance of a receipt for the marked P20.00 bill does not
affect the prosecution's case.  Nor does
Sgt. Sarong's taking out from his pocket the marked bill while testifying
affect its integrity as a piece of evidence.  As a matter of fact, since the sale of the marijuana was already
established by other evidence, the presentation of the buy-bust money is not
indispensable.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, the transcripts of the proceedings in the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>do not show that the counsel for the accused objected to the
presentation of these exhibits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her contentions in her second assigned error that Sgt. Sarong
could not identify or single out the stick which was the basis of his
conclusion that the other fourteen sticks contained marijuana and that the
marijuana cigarettes offered as evidence were not the same cigarettes allegedly
taken from her<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
deserve scant consideration because it was clearly established by the
prosecution that all the marijuana cigarettes she sold to him were found
positive for marijuana and that these were the same articles which were offered
in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there merit in her claim in the third assigned error that
the marijuana cigarettes and the P20.00<span style="">
</span>marked bill are inadmissible against her for having been obtained without
a search warrant in violation of her constitutional right against unreasonable
search and seizure.  She was caught <i><span style="">in flagrante</span></i><span style=""> </span>in a buy-bust operation selling
marijuana to the poseur-buyer, Sgt. Sarong.  Pursuant then to Section 5(a), Rule 113 and Section 12, Rule 126 of the
Rules of Court, she could be lawfully arrested without a warrant and searched
for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the commission
of the offense.  In <i>People </i><i><span style="">vs. Paco,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court explained the consequences
of a valid warrantless arrest:</p>

<blockquote>"Having caught the appellant in
flagrante as a result of the buy-bust operation, the policemen were not only
authorized but were also under obligation to apprehend the drug pusher even
without a warrant of arrest.  And since
appellant's arrest was lawful, it follows that the search made incidental to
the arrest was also valid (Rule 126, Sec. 12; Alvero vs. Dizon, 76 Phil. 637
(1946); People vs. Claudio, G.R. No. 72564, April 15, 1988)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the instant case, since the
warrantless search was an incident to a lawful arrest, the marijuana sticks and
the marked bill are admissible in evidence.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The last assigned error is baseless.  The prosecution witnesses identified the accused in court as the
seller of the marijuana sticks who had received the marked P20.00 bill.  In his direct testimony, Sgt. Sarong even
pointed to her.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL SANTIAGO:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Sgt. Recla also testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL SANTIAGO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">More than anything else, she never
asserted that she is not the Evelyn Garcia referred to by the said witnesses as
the one arrested on 12 April 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we affirm the conviction of the accused, the penalty
imposed <span style="">upon </span>her must, however,
be modified in view of the <span style="">new </span>amendments
introduced by R.A. No. 7659<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> to
Section 4, Article II, and Section 20, Article IV of R.A. No 6425, as
amended.  R.A. No. 7659 was approved on
13 December 1993 and took effect on 31 December 1993.  As thus further amended, the penalty prescribed in Section 4 was
changed from "life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty
thousand to thirty thousand pesos" to <i><span style="">"reclusion perpetua </span></i>to death and a fine ranging from
five hundred thousand pesos to ten million pesos." However, pursuant to
Section 17 of R.A. No. 7659, which amends Section 20 of R.A. No. 6425, the new
penalty shall be applied if the quantity of the dangerous drugs involved falls
within the first paragraph of the amended Section 20, and if the quantity is
lower <span style="">than </span>those specified in
said first paragraph, the penalty shall be from <span style="">"<i>prision correccional</i> </span>to <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua.</span></i><span style="">"<i>
</i></span>The pertinent portion of the amended Section 20 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. </span>20.  <i>Application of Penalties, Confiscation
and Forfeiture of the Proceeds or Instrument of the Crime. -- </i>The penalties
for offenses under Section 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 of Article II and Sections 14,
14-A, 15 and 16 of Article III of this Act shall be applied if the dangerous
drugs involved is in any of the following quantities:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">5. 750 grams or more of Indian hemp or marijuana;</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Otherwise, if the quantity involved is less than the foregoing
quantities, the penalty shall range from <i>prision correccional</i> to <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> depending upon the quantity."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The penalty then in Section 4 is now
based on the quantity of the prohibited drugs involved, except where the victim
is a minor or where the prohibited drug involved in any offense under Section 4
is the proximate cause of the death of the victim, in which case the maximum
penalty prescribed in Section 4 shall be imposed regardless of the quantity of
the prohibited drugs involved.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

the penalty to be imposed shall range from <i>prision correccional </i>to <i>reclusion

through oversight in the drafting, in the provisions on the penalty of <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> as shown by its dual imposition, <i>i.e</i>., as the minimum of
the penalty where the quantity of the dangerous drugs involved is more than
those specified in the first paragraph of the amended Section 20 and also as
the maximum of the penalty where the quantity of the dangerous drugs involved
is less than those so specified in the first paragraph.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(3)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Considering that the aforesaid penalty of <i>prision
correccional </i>to <i>reclusion temporal </i>shall depend upon the quantity of
the dangerous drugs involved, each of the component penalties thereof -- <i>prision
correccional, prision mayor, </i>and <i>reclusion temporal -- </i>shall be
considered as a principal imposable penalty depending on the quantity, such
that the quantity of the drugs enumerated in the second paragraph should then
be divided into three, with the resulting quotient, and double or treble the
same, as the bases for determining the appropriate component penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(4)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">
</span><!--[endif]-->  The modifying
circumstances in the Revised Penal Code may be appreciated to determine the
proper period of the corresponding imposable penalty or even to effect its
reduction by one or more degrees; provided, however, that in no case should
such graduation of penalties reduce the imposable penalty lower than <i>prision
correccional.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(5)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">
</span><!--[endif]-->  In appropriate
instances, the Indeterminate Sentence Law shall be applied and considering that
R.A. No. 7659 has unqualifiedly adopted the penalties under the Revised Penal
Code with their technical signification and effects, then the crimes under the
Dangerous Drugs Act shall now be considered as crimes punished by the Revised
Penal Code; hence, pursuant to Section 1 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
indeterminate penalty which may be imposed shall be one whose maximum shall be
within the range of the imposable penalty and whose minimum shall be within the
range of the penalty next lower in degree to the imposable penalty.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing as our touchstones, and it appearing that the
accused sold only fifteen (15) sticks of marijuana cigarettes, the second
paragraph of Section 20 of R.A. No. 6425, as further amended by Section 17 of
R.A. No. 7659, is applicable and considering such quantity, the proper
imposable penalty should be <i>prision correccional.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the accused may then be
sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) months of <i>arresto
