				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks the reversal of the decision of then Deputy
Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
which affirmed the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC
Case No. <span class="GramE">LR-4320.</span><span style="">&nbsp;

Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>, Jr., which ordered the reinstatement
of complainants (herein petitioners) to their former positions without loss of
seniority and other personnel privileges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as succinctly stated by the Solicitor
General, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The 136 petitioners herein are former employees of private
respondent Atlantic Container Corporation (hereinafter called <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place>
for brevity).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners organized
themselves into the Atlantic Container Employees Organization and affiliated

<blockquote>“On <st1:date year="1964" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1964</st1:date>,
<st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place> and FEDLU executed a Collective Bargaining
Agreement which was amended on <st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1964</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claiming that <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place>

implement the Collective Bargaining, Agreement and its amendment, petitioners
and FEDLU struck on <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Atlantic Container Employees
Organization and FEDLU filed Case No. 5195-ULP in the Court of Industrial
Relations (hereinafter called CIR for brevity) charging <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place>,
Roberto Jacinto and one <span class="SpellE">Hedy</span> F. Jacinto as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-top: 12pt;">‘Through the verified complaint filed by
the Prosecutor of the Court, complainants charge the respondents of unfair
labor practice within the meaning of Section 4(a), subsections 1, 2, and 6 in
relation to Section 13 of Republic Act No. 875.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is specifically alleged that on February 11, 1964 and August 31,
1964, the company and complainants entered into a collective bargaining agreement
and a supple­mental agreement respectively, which provide, among others, for
union shop, grievance procedure, check-off of union dues and increase of
salary; that respondents, in bad faith refused to implement said provisions of
the agreements notwithstanding complainants’ repeated demands; that soon
thereafter, respondents rotated the permanent employees who are active members
of the union; that on account of said acts of respondents, the union filed a
notice of strike on February 9, 1966 and on February 16, 1966 it actually
declared a strike; and that during the strike, respondents told Benito <span class="SpellE">Dolosa</span> that he would be reinstated if he resigned as
president of the union and dissolved the same.’ (Petition, ANNEX A, pp. 1-2)</p>

<blockquote>“On <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1972</st1:date>,
a Decision was rendered by the CIR in Case No. 5195-ULP (Petition, ANNEX “A”),

Roberto Jacinto, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

Cornelio Aguilar, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Hausan</span> and Mauro <span class="SpellE">Wagan</span>, with back wages from February 16, 1966 up to a
period of three years, without loss of seniority and to make good the benefits
herein found to have been denied them.’</p>

and <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1972</st1:date>, the
Atlantic Container Employees Organization and FEDLU filed motions to reconsider
aforesaid Decision, presumably for the reinstatement of all the petitioners
herein, but the CIR denied the motions for being <u>pro</u> <u>forma</u> and
for having been filed out of time (Petition, ANNEX “B”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Because Atlantic allegedly stopped operating prior to the
rendition of the Decision in Case No. 5195-ULP, which stoppage of operation
petitioners claim they actually learned in 1973 after an investigation, the 136
petitioners herein filed Charge No. 5701-ULP (Petition, ANNEX “C”) in the CIR

<p class="BODY">Respondents, Inland Industries, Inc., <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>

their Comment on August 30, 1979 (p. 120-131, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
raising the same arguments raised before the Labor Arbiter, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) that the charge subject of the petition is
barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>;
2) that petitioners’ cause of action had prescribed and that the same is now barred
by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>; and 3) that the corporate and distinct
personality of respondent Inland was not successfully pierced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents Atlantic Container Corporation and Roberto Jacinto
filed their Comments (pp. 136-141, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) on <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1979</st1:date> raising the same
arguments as <span class="GramE">respondents</span> Inland, et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, on the other hand, filed his Comment (pp.
148-161, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) dated <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His stand was different from that taken by
public respondents NLRC and Deputy Minister <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,
and he joined the petitioners in their arguments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that public respondents NLRC and then Deputy
Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>
committed grave abuse of discretion when it ordered the dismissal of their
complaint on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) their
cause of action is barred by the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>; b) their cause of action is barred
by prescription; and c) private respondents Atlantic Container Corporation and
Inland Industries, Inc. were separate and distinct entities.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioners, Case No. 5195 (hereinafter referred
to as the first case), brought before the Court of Industrial Relations was
singularly initiated and prosecuted by FEDLU, the labor union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not enumerate any one of the 136
strikers who were the complainants in the second case, subject of this
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further contend
that the respondents in the first case were <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place>,
Roberto Jacinto and <span class="SpellE">Hedy</span> F. Jacinto while in the
second <span class="GramE">case,</span> the respondents were Atlantic, Roberto
Jacinto, Inland Industries, Inc., <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Arriola</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Katalbas</span>, Paz <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Goshi</span> de <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span> and Aurora <span class="SpellE">Jereza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the petitioners, adopting the view of the Solicitor General in his Comment,
contend that the second case is based on two causes of action namely, (1) one
predicated on fraud x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
and (2) the other based on private respondent’s violation of the CBA which
culminated in a strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
case, however, the cause of action is violation of the CBA only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the second case is not barred by the prior
judgment in the first complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of this petition rests primarily on the issue of
whether or not the second case (Case No. LR-4320) is barred by the prior
judgment in the first case (Case No. 5195) and if not, whether or not
petitioners’ cause of action had prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">For a prior judgment to constitute a bar to a subsequent case,
the following requisites must concur:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a)
it must be a final judgment or order; (b) the court rendering the same must
have jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties; (c) it must be
a judgment or order on the merits, and (d) there must be between the two cases
identity of parties, subject matter and cause of action (<span class="SpellE">Ibabao</span>
v. IAC, <b>No. 74848</b>, May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 76).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the first three (3) requisites are
present in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, the
decision in the first complaint had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
motion for reconsideration filed by the union in that case was denied by the
CIR and no petition questioning the denial was brought to this court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact of its finality was admitted by the
petitioners in their second complaint [Par. 3, Charge (Complaint), ULP-5701,
pp. 42-46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Second, the Court of Industrial Relations (CIR) which rendered the
decision had jurisdiction over the subject matter and over the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, the judgment rendered therein was a
judgment on the merits of the case after the parties presented their evidence,
oral and <b>documentary</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going now to the fourth requisite, private respondents NLRC and
then Deputy Minister <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> did not commit any grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction when they ruled that
there is, between the first and the second complaints, identity of causes of
action, subject matter and parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, contends that there are two (2) causes of
action in the charge subject of this petition, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the unfair labor practices committed by
Atlantic; and 2) the alleged fraudulent closure of Atlantic and the birth of
inland which were actually one and the same corporation, with the purpose of <span class="SpellE">avading</span> its obligations to Atlantic’s employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an identity of cause of action in
the two cases, that is, the unfair labor practices committed by <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place>
against its employees during its existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The obligations of Atlantic arising from the acts of unfair labor
practices committed against its employees during the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span>
existence were already settled in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that whatever cause of action
individual petitioners had against <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place> for
violations of the CBA constituting an unfair labor practice act had already
been heard in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union
presented its evidence, oral and documentary although only those who testified
were ordered reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation
regarding the fraudulent closure of <st1:place>Atlantic</st1:place> and the
establishment of Inland for the purpose of evading its obligations to the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span> employees for unfair labor practice comes to play
only in the execution or enforcement of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision in the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot,
when joined with the unfair labor charges already settled in the first case,
make out a different cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the <span class="GramE">complainants in the
first charge was</span> the union, in reality it had no material interest in
the outcome of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real party
who stands to be benefited or defeated by a case brought in the name of the
union <span class="GramE">are</span> the union members themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the judgment therein had become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the subsequent filing of another ULP
charge against Atlantic for the same violations committed during its <span class="GramE">existence,</span> is barred <u>by</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bringing of the same action in the name of the individual members of
the union will not take out the case from the ambit of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither will the bringing in of new
respondents in the name of the new corporation Inland, its incorporators and
private respondent Roberto Jacinto, who is also its General Manager, help
petitioners’ cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that in the decision of the first complaint,
only seven (7) of the members of the union were ordered reinstated “inasmuch as
complainants and/or their witnesses failed to present any evidence, oral or
documentary, as to who were those other union members who joined the strike.”
In the second complaint, Labor Arbiter Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>
ordered the reinstatement of only eight-six (86) of the 136 petitioners-members
of the union “considering, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
that not all complainants evinced their desire to prosecute the case, and “the
award (was) extended only to those who testified and/or presented their
respective manifestation of prosecuting their causes of action x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.” If We were to allow the
second complaint to prosper for the eighty-six (86) (out of 136)
petitioners-members union after only seven (7) were ordered reinstated in the
first complaints, nothing would deter the other members of the union who were
not yet ordered to be reinstated from bringing a third complaint and there
would be no end to the litigation until all of the members of the union are
ordered reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have already held that when a labor union accuses an employer
of acts of unfair labor practice allegedly committed during a given period of
time, the charges should include all acts of unfair labor practice committed
against any and all members of the union during that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The union should not, upon dismissal of the
charges first preferred, be allowed to split its cause of action and harass the

CIR, No. <span class="GramE">L-19334, August 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 832 at 837).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The underlying philosophy of the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> is
that parties ought not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than
once; that when a right or fact has been <span class="SpellE">juducially</span>
tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, <u>or</u> <u>an</u> <u>opportunity</u>
<u>for</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>trial</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>given</u>,
the judgment of the court, so long as it remains <span class="SpellE">unreversed</span>,
should be conclusive upon the parties and those in <span class="SpellE">privity</span>
with them in law or estate, (<span class="SpellE">Marabao</span> v. Mendoza, 119
SCRA 97 <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Cao</span> v. CA, 132

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether or not the second ULP charge had prescribed
need not be resolved by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in view of Our finding that
<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
had set in.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree however, with the Labor Arbiter’s finding that the
closure of Atlantic and the establishment of Inland for the purpose of avoiding
any obligation which may be adjudged against the former in favor of its
employees was substantially proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
observed by Labor Arbiter Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Collado</span>:</p>

<blockquote>“On the connection of Inland Industries, Inc. to Atlantic Container
Corporation, neither respondents presented evidence to negate complainants’
exhibits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inland merely submitted a
supposed mortgage executed by Roberto A. Jacinto and his wife of Atlantics
machineries/assets to the Development Bank of the Philippines and its
incorporation papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, it
should be noted that the respondents did not question the validity of Atlantic
Container Corporation and Roberto A. <span class="SpellE">Jacinto’s</span>
culpability for unfair labor practices having adopted as evidence, as
heretofore stated, the CIR judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Also, <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> are the documental
proofs that <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Arriola</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Katalbas</span>
were co-employees of the complainants (reflected in the SSS records); Roberto
A. Jacinto, Atlantic Container Corporation’s General manager, who wrote the SSS
on August 9, 1967 informing it of Atlantic’s closure ‘as of May, 1966’ due to
labor strike since February, 1966.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
“D”), reappeared later as <span class="SpellE">Inland’s</span> General Manager in
his letter to the SSS (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “F”), and <span class="SpellE">Inland’s</span> official birth on July 29, 1966 immediately after
Roberto A. Jacinto declared Atlantic as non-existent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the basis of the foregoing, it can be safely concluded that
Inland Industries, was conceived with the specific end of rendering moot and
academic any relief emanating, from Atlantic Container Corporation’s unfair labor
practices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is very apparent from
the records of this case as a whole.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Under the circumstances, piercing the corporate veil is
permissible, especially so when a second entity is born and generated to
subvert the law and the purpose of its creation and Inland Industries, Inc. was
precisely registered by Roberto A. Jacinto to defeat the legitimate claims and
aspirations of the herein complainants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that act, Roberto A. Jacinto, clearly the owner of Atlantic Container
Corporation and Inland Industries, Inc., resorted to the corporate of <span class="SpellE">Inland’s</span> distinctness of personality to defeat public
convenience, justify wrongdoing, protect fraud and perpetrate deception, and
primordial of them all, to escape liability for his unfair labor practice
acts.” (pp. 52-53, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is a sufficient reason, for the purpose of enforcing the
judgment in the first case, for applying the rule that when a second entity is
born or generated to subvert the law, resort to corporate fiction of
distinctness of personality is prevented.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is hereby rendered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a) AFFIRMING the dismissal of the complaint
in NLRC Case No. LR-4320; and b) REVERSING the findings of public respondents with
regard to distinctness of personality of Atlantic and Inland for purposes of
compliance with their obligations to the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span>
employees as adjudged in Case No. 5195-ULP.</p>
