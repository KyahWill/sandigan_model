A Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari </em>assailing the Decision, 
dated October 6, 1980, and the Resolution on the Motion for 
Reconsideration, dated November 27, 1980, of the then Court of First 
Instance of Pangasinan, Branch I, in Civil Case No. 15620 entitled 
"Corazon DAGUINES <em>vs</em>. MERCEDES Calimlim-Canullas", upholding 
the sale of a parcel of land in favor of DAGUINES but not of the 
conjugal house thereon.
<p>
The background facts may be summarized as follows: Petitioner MERCEDES 
Calimlim-Canullas and FERNANDO Canullas were married on December 19, 
1962. They begot five children. They lived in a small house on the 
residential land in ques­tion with an area of approximately 891 square 
meters, located at Bacabac, Bugallon, Pangasinan. After FERNANDO's 
father died in 1965, FERNANDO inherited the land.
</p><p>
In 1978, FERNANDO abandoned his family and was living with private 
respondent Corazon DAGUINES. During the pendency of this appeal, they 
were convicted of concubinage in a judgment rendered on October 27, 1981
 by the then Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch II, which 
judgment has become final.
</p><p>
On April 15, 1980, FERNANDO sold the subject property with the house 
thereon to DAGUINES for the sum of P2,000.00. In the document of sale, 
FERNANDO described the house as "also inherited by me from my deceased 
parents".
</p><p>
Unable to take possession of the lot and house, DAGUINES initiated a 
complaint on June 19, 1980 for quieting of title and damages against 
MERCEDES. The latter resisted and claimed that the house in dispute 
where she and her children were residing, including the coconut trees on
 the land, were built and planted with conjugal funds and through her 
industry; that the sale of the land together with the house and 
improvements to DAGUINES was null and void because they are conjugal 
properties, and she had not given her consent to the sale.
</p><p>
In its original judgment, respondent Court principally declared DAGUINES
 "as the lawful owner of the land in question as well as the one-half 
(½) of the house erected on said land." Upon reconsideration prayed for 
by MERCEDES, however, respondent Court resolved:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the dispositive portion of the Decision of this Court,
 promulgated on October 6, 1980, is hereby amended to read as follows: </p>
  <p> "(1)         Declaring plaintiff as the true and lawful owner of the land in question and the 10 coconut trees; </p>
  <p> "(2)         Declaring as null and void the sale of the conjugal 
house to plaintiff on April 15, 1980 (Exhibit A) including the 3 coconut
 trees and other crops planted during the conjugal relation between 
Fernando Canullas (vendor) and his legiti­mate wife, herein defendant 
Mercedes Calimlim­-Canullas; </p>
  <p> x x x "
  </p>
  <p> The issues posed for resolution are (1) whether or not the 
construction of a conjugal house on the exclusive property of the 
husband ipso facto gave the land the cha­racter of conjugal property; 
and (2) whether or not the sale of the lot together with the house and 
improvements thereon was valid under the circumstances surrounding the 
transaction. </p>
  <p>
    The determination of the first issue revolves around the 
interpretation to be given to the second paragraph of Article 158 of the
 Civil Code, which reads:
  </p>
  <p> "x x x </p>
  <p> "Buildings constructed at the expense of the part­nership during 
the marriage on land belonging to one of the spouses also pertain to the
 partnership, but the value of the land shall be reimbursed to the 
spouse who owns the same."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We hold that pursuant to the foregoing provision both the land and the 
building belong to the conjugal partnership but the conjugal partnership
 is indebted to the husband for the value of the land. The spouse owning
 the lot becomes a creditor of the conjugal partnership for the value of
 the lot<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> , which value would be reimbursed at the liquid­ation of the conjugal partnership.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
In his commentary on the corresponding provision in the Spanish Civil Code (Art. 1404), Manresa stated:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "El articulo cambia la doctrina; los edificios construidos durante
 el matrimonio en suelo propio de uno de los conjuges son gananciales, 
abonandose el valor del suelo al conjuge a quien pertenezca."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is true that in the case of Maramba <em>vs</em>. Lozano,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  relied upon by respondent Judge, it was held that land be­longing to 
one of the spouses, upon which the spouses have built a house, becomes 
conjugal property only when the conjugal partnership is liquidated and 
indemnity paid to the owner of the land. We believe that the better rule
 is that enunciated by Mr. Justice JBL Reyes in Padilla <em>vs</em>. Paterno, 3 SCRA 678, 691 (1961), where the following was explained:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As to the above properties, their conversion from paraphernal to 
conjugal assets should be deemed to retroact to the time the conjugal 
buildings were first constructed thereon or at the very latest, to the 
tine immediately before the death of Narciso A. Padilla that ended the 
conjugal partnership. They can not be considered to have become conjugal
 property only as of the tine their values were paid to the estate of 
the widow Concepcion Paterno because by that time the conjugal 
partnership no longer existed and it could not acquire the ownership of 
said properties. The acquisition by the partnership of these properties 
was, under the 1943 decision, subject to the suspensive condition that 
their values would be reimbursed to the widow at the liquidation of the 
conjugal partnership; once paid, the effects of the fulfillment of the 
condition should be deemed to retroact to the date the obligation was 
constituted (Art. 1187, New Civil Code). x x x "
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing premises considered, it follows that FERNANDO could not 
have alienated the house and lot to DAGUINES since MERCEDES had not 
given her consent to said sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Anent the second issue, we find that the contract of sale was null and 
void for being contrary to morals and public policy. The sale was made 
by a husband in favor of a concubine after he had abandoned his family 
and left the conjugal home where his wife and children lived and from 
whence they derived their support. That sale was subversive of the 
stability of the family, a basic social institution which public policy 
cherishes and protects.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
Article 1409 of the Civil Code states <em>inter alia </em>that: contracts whose cause, object, or purpose is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy are <em>void </em>and <em>inexistent</em> from the very beginning.
</p><p>
Article 1352 also provides that: "Contracts without cause, or with <em>unlawful cause, produce no effect whatsoever</em>. The cause is unlawful if it is contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy."
</p><p>
Additionally, the law emphatically prohibits the spouses from selling property to each other subject to certain exceptions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  Similarly, donations between spouses during marriage are prohibited.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  And this is so because if transfers or conveyances between spouses 
were allowed during marriage, that would destroy the system of conjugal 
partnership, a basic policy in civil law. It was also de­signed to 
prevent the exercise of undue influence by one spouse over the other<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 , as well as to protect the institution of marriage, which is the 
cornerstone of family law. The prohibitions apply to a couple living as 
husband and wife without benefit of marriage, otherwise, "the condi­tion
 of those who incurred guilt would turn out to be better than those in 
legal union." Those provisions are dictated by public interest and their
 criterion must be imposed upon the will of the parties. That was the 
ruling in Buenaventura <em>vs</em>. Bautista, also penned by Justice JBL Reyes (CA) 50 O.G. 3679, and cited in Matabuena <em>vs</em>. Cervantes.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  We quote hereunder the pertinent dissertation on this point:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We reach a different conclusion. While Art. 133 of the Civil Code
 considers as void a donation between the spouses during the marriage, <em>policy considerations</em> of the most exigent character as well as the dictates of <em>morality</em> require that the <em>same prohibition should apply</em> to a <em>common-law relationship</em>. </p>
  <p> "As announced in the outset of this opinion, a 1954 Court of Appeals decision, Buenaventura <em>vs</em>.
 Bautista, 50 OG 3679, interpreting a similar provision of the old Civil
 Code speaks unequivocally. If the policy of the law is, in the language
 of the opinion of the then Justice J.B.L. Reyes of that Court, 'to 
prohibit donations in favor of the other consort and his descendants 
because of fear of <em>undue influence and improper pressure</em> upon the donor, a prejudice deeply rooted in our ancient law, x x x, then <em>there
 is every reason to apply the same prohibitive policy to persons living 
together as husband and wife without benefit of nuptials</em>. For it is
 not to be doubted that assent to such irregular connection for thirty 
years be­speaks greater influence of one party over the other, so that 
the danger that the law seeks to avoid is corres­pondingly increased'. 
Moreover, as pointed out by Ulpian (in his lib 32 ad Sabinum, fr.1), 'It
 would not be just that such donations should subsist, lest the 
conditions of those who incurred guilt should turn out to be better.' So
 long as marriage remains the cornerstone of our family law, reason and 
morality alike demand that the disabilities attached to marriage should 
likewise attach to <em>concubinage</em>" (Italics supplied). </p>

<p>
WHEREFORE, the Decision of respondent Judge, dated October 6, 1980, and 
his Resolution of November 27, 1980 on petitioner's Motion for 
Reconsideration, are hereby set aside and the sale of the lot, house and
 improvements in question, is hereby declared null and void. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
