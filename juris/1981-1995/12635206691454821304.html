on January 14, 1934, the cadastral court acquired original and exclusive

et al., Vol. 48, Phil. p. 973, We held that land granted by the Government to a
private individual who applied for it as a homestead, is considered no longer <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> within the meaning of the Land Registration
Act after the issuance of the homestead patent and the original certificate of
title issued in accordance therewith.</blockquote>

al., 43 Phil. 558, as well as in El <span class="SpellE">Hogar</span> Filipino v.
<span class="SpellE">Olviga</span>, 60 Phil., p. 17, We likewise held that in a
cadastral proceeding the Court has no jurisdiction to decree again the
registration of land already decreed and registered in an earlier registration
case, and that the second decree entered for the same land is null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, considering that the petitioners in both cases
before Us and their predecessors had been in possession of the land, first as
homesteaders and later, as absolute owners, for more than ten years before
respondent <span class="SpellE">Reaño</span> filed his application for
registration; that, as a result of the proceedings had in connection with their
Homestead application, the homestead patents and original certificates of title
mentioned heretofore were issued in their names, no further argument is needed
to show that said petitioners and their predecessors had acquired title to the
land by prescript<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt">i</span>on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It being clear from the foregoing that the registration decreed
in the name of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> of Lots 1896,
1914, 1913 and 1863 of the Cadastral Survey of Sta. Rosa, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> is null and void, the certificates of title
covering the same issued in his name must also be deemed null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From this the inevitable conclusion is that
he had no right to the issuance of the writs of possession complained of."</blockquote>

proper notice was served, the required investigation was conducted by the

of Lots 1896, 1940 (should be 1914) and 1913; secondly, on May 16, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Reano</span> filed in Cadastral Case No. 67, a 'Petition for
Continuation of Cadastral Proceedings' and for the setting aside of the order
