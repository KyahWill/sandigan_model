				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>the Employees' Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. 0509
which affirmed the decision of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)
and denied the claim for death benefits filed by Carolina Clemente, widow of
the late Pedro Clemente.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are summarized in the memorandum
for the respondent Government Service Insurance System, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's husband, the late Pedro Clemente, was for ten
(10) years a janitor in the Department of Health (Dagupan City), assigned at
the Ilocos Norte Skin Clinic, Laoag City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was hospitalized from November 3 to 14, 1976 at the Central Luzon
Sanitarium, Tala Sanitarium, Tala, Caloocan City, due to his ailment of
'nephritis', as per medical certification of his attending physician, Dr.
Winifredo Samson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also found to
be suffering from such ailments as portal cirrhosis and leprosy, otherwise
known as Hansen's Disease.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 14, 1976, Pedro Clemente died of uremia due to
nephritis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, petitioner filed
with the GSIS a claim for employees’ compensation under the Labor Code, as
amended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On February 4, 1977, the GSIS denied the claim of the
petitioner because the ailments of her husband are not occupational diseases
taking into consideration the nature of his work and/or (sic) or were not in
the least causally related to his duties and conditions of work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 9, 1977, petitioner requested for reconsideration of
the GSIS' denial of her claim, stating that the ailments of her husband were
contracted in the course of employment and were aggravated by the nature of his
work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleged that her
husband, as janitor of the Ilocos Norte Skin Clinic (Laoag City), worked in
direct contact with persons suffering from different skin diseases and was
exposed to obnoxious dusts and other dirt which contributed to his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ailment of Hansen's disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Citing further the cases of </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Seven-Up</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

to his direct contact with persons suffering from this ailment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Acting upon petitioner's request for reconsideration, the GSIS, on
April 11, 1977, reiterated its previous denial of her claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 14, 1977, treating the request for reconsideration
as an appeal, the GSIS forwarded the records of the petitioner’ claim for
review by the ECC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On October 26, 1977, respondent ECC affirmed the GSIS’ action
of denial and rendered its own decision dismissing petitioner's claim (ECC Case
No. 0509).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent ECC'S decision was anchored upon the findings that
the ailments are not listed as occupational diseases; that there was no
substantial evidence of causal connection; and that, in fact, the evidence was
that the deceased had already contracted the Hansen's disease before his
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the exact words of the
ECC:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">" 'In the case at bar, since the deceased's ailments are not
listed as occupational diseases, appellant herein must prove that such ailments
were caused by deceased's employment and that the risk of contracting the same
was increased by his working conditions in order to be compensable.</p>

<p class="2Q">"'A mere cursory reading of the evidences on record, however,
will disclose that appellant failed to submit the required proof of
causation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no substantial proof
in the record from which we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">could draw
the conclusion that indeed the nature of deceased's </span>employment as
Janitor of Ilocos Norte Skin Clinic could be traced as the direct cause of his
ailment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in the absence of such
evidence, we are not disposed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">disturb
on appeal the findings of the respondent System.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"'On the contrary, we find the records that the deceased,
prior to his employment in this office, was already suffering from his ailment
of Hansen's disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This proves that
his working conditions did not increase the risk of his contracting the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If at all, his employment merely aggravated
his ailments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, however,
aggravation of a pre-existing illness, a rule under the old law, is not anymore
a ground for compensation under the new law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the cases cited by the appellant cannot be raised as authorities to
support her claim."</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner now seeks a review of the ECC decision." (pp.
76-78, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There is no question that
the claim falls under the provisions of the Labor Code, as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Article </span>167(L) of the Labor Code
and Section 1(b) Rule III of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation, for
the sickness and the resulting disability or death to be compensable, the
sickness must be the result of an occupational disease listed under Annex
"A" of the Rules with the conditions therein satisfied; otherwise,
proof must be shown that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by
the working conditions (De Jesus v. Employees' Compensation Commission, 142
SCRA 92, 96).</p>

<p class="BODY">As the illnesses of the deceased are admittedly, not listed under
Annex "A" of the Rules as occupational diseases, the petitioner bases
her claim under the theory of increased risk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She alleges that the deceased, as janitor of the Ilocos Norte Skin
Clinic, was exposed to patients suffering from various kinds of skin diseases,
including Hansen's disease or leprosy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She avers that for ten years, the deceased had to clean the clinic and
its surroundings and to freely mix with its patients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She claims that it was during this time that
he was attacked by other dreadful diseases such as uremia, cancer of the liver,
and nephritis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondent Employees' Compensation
Commission contends that the petitioner failed to prove by substantial evidence
that the deceased's ailments were indeed caused by his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It maintains that the deceased merely had a
recurrence of a pre-existing illness aggravated possibly by the nature of his
employment and that there is no evidence on record showing that the nature of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deceased's employment was the
direct cause of any of his illnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The respondent Government
Service Insurance System concurs with the views of the respondent
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, however, argues that it
should be dropped as a party respondent in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It claims that the petitioner has no cause of
action against it, the subject of judicial review being the adverse decision of
the respondent Commission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Acosta v. Employees' Compensation Commission, 109 SCRA 209).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claimant must show, at least, by
substantial evidence that the development of the disease is brought largely by
the conditions present in the nature of the job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the law requires is a reasonable

sufficient evidence on record to sustain the petitioner's view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records disclose that in resisting the

deceased, i.e. nephritis, leprosy, etc., could be traced from bacterial and
viral infections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
leprosy, it is known that the source of infection is the discharge from lesions
of persons with active cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
believed that the bacillus enters the body through the skin or through the

was the employee most exposed to the dangerous concentration of infected
materials, and not being a medical practitioner, least likely to know how to
avoid infection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, not unreasonable
to conclude that Mr. Clemente's working conditions definitely increased the
risk of his contracting the aforementioned ailments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court has held in appropriate cases that
the conservative posture of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">respondents
is not consistent with the liberal interpretation of the Labor Code and the
social justice guarantee embodied in the Constitution in favor of the workers

1982; and Cristobal v. Employees' Compensation Commission, et al., <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It clashes with the injunction in the Labor
Code (Article 4, New Labor Code) that, as a rule, doubts should be resolved in

Commission, 139 SCRA 270, 277).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

contend that the compensable factor of increased risks of contracting the
disease is not present in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fallacy in this theory lies in the failure to explain how a
sick person was able to enter the government service more than ten years before
he became too ill to work and at a time when aggravation of a disease was compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidencee to show that Mr.
Clemente was hired inspite of having an existing disease liable to become
worse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's arguments of recurrence of an already cured

plausible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
