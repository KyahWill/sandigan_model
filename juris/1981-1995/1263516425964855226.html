				<BR><STRONG>FRANCISCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Complainant Cynthia B. Rosacia, president of Tacma, Phils., Inc., a duly registered corporation, filed a complaint for disbarment dated October 25, 1991, against herein respondent Atty. Benjamin B. Bulalacao.&nbsp; Acting on the complaint, the Court in a resolution dated February 24, 1992, resolved to refer the case to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.&nbsp; Commissioner Victor C. Fernandez, the IBP investigating commissioner, found that respondent breached his oath of office and accordingly recommended respondent's suspension from the practice of law for three (3) months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> In a resolution dated July 30, 1994, the IBP Board of Governors resolved to adopt and approve the commissioner's report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>As found by the IBP, the undisputed facts are as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"On June 1, 1990, by virtue of a written Agreement (Exh. "3-a"), respondent Atty. Benjamin B. Bulalacao was hired as retained counsel of a corporation by the name of Tacma Phils., Inc.<br><br>"On October 31, 1990, the lawyer-client relationship between the respondent and Tacma Phils., Inc. was severed as shown by another agreement of even date (Exh. "3-b").<br><br>"On July, 1991, or after almost nine (9) months from the date respondent's retainer agreement with Tacma, Phils., Inc. was terminated, several employees of the corporation consulted the respondent for the purpose of filing an action for illegal dismissal. Thereafter, he agreed to handle the case for the said employees as against Tacma, Phils., Inc. by filing a complaint before the National Labor Relations Commission, and appearing in their behalf."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>The sole issue to be addressed is whether or not respondent breached his oath of office for representing the employees of his former client, Tacma, Phils., Inc., after the termination of their attorney-client relationship.&nbsp; We agree with the findings of the IBP that respondent breached his oath of office.&nbsp; Respondent does not now dispute this.&nbsp; In fact, in his motion for reconsideration, respondent admitted that he "did commit an act bordering on grave misconduct, if not outright violation of his attorney's oath".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> However, respondent is pleading for the Court's compassion and leniency to reduce the IBP recommended three months suspension to either fine or admonition with the following proffered grounds: that he is relatively new in the profession having been admitted to the Philippine Bar on April 10, 1990 at the age of 46 when the complained conduct was committed on August 1991; that he is of humble beginnings and his suspension will deprive his family of its only source of livelihood he being the sole bread winner in the family; that he has fully realized his mistake and the gravity of his offense for which he is fully repentant; that he has severed his attorney-client relationship with the employees of Tacma, Phils., Inc. by inhibiting himself and withdrawing his appearance as counsel in the labor case against Tacma, Phils., Inc.; and that he pledges not to commit the same mistake and to henceforth strictly adhere to the professional standards set forth by the Code of Professional Responsibility.<br><br>The Court reiterates that an attorney owes loyalty to his client not only in the case in which he has represented him but also after the relation of attorney and client has terminated as it is not good practice to permit him afterwards to defend in another case other person against his former client under the pretext that the case is distinct from, and independent of the former case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> It behooves respondent not only to keep inviolate the client's confidence, but also to avoid the appearance of treachery and double dealing for only then can litigants be encouraged to entrust their secrets to their attorneys which is of paramount importance in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The relation of attorney and client is one of confidence and trust in the highest degree.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> A lawyer owes fidelity to the cause of his client and he ought to be mindful of the trust and confidence reposed in him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> An attorney not only becomes familiar with all the facts connected with his client's cause, but also learns from his client the weak and strong points of the case. No opportunity must be given attorneys to take advantage of the secrets of clients obtained while the confidential relation of attorney and client exists.&nbsp; Otherwise, the legal profession will suffer by the loss of the confidence of the people.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Respondent's plea for leniency cannot be granted.&nbsp; We note that respondent is new in the profession as he was just admitted to the Philippine Bar on April 10, 1990, when the breach of his oath of office occurred more than a year after.&nbsp; Having just hurdled the bar examinations which included an examination in legal ethics, surely the precepts of the Code of Professional Responsibility to keep inviolate the client's trust and confidence even after the attorney-client relation is terminated<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> must have been still fresh in his mind. A lawyer starting to establish his stature in the legal profession must start right and dutifully abide by the norms of conduct of the profession.&nbsp; This will ineluctably redound to his benefit and to the upliftment of the legal profession as well.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, respondent is hereby SUSPENDED from the practice of law for three months.&nbsp; Let this resolution be attached to respondent's record in the Office of the Bar Confidant and copies thereof furnished to all courts and to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines.<br><br><i>Regalado, Puno,</i> and <i>Mendoza, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman),</i> on official leave.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Report and Recommendation, April 29, 1994.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Resolution No. XI-94-146.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Report, <i>supra</i>, pp.1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Motion for Reconsideration, October 10, 1994, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Sumangil v.
