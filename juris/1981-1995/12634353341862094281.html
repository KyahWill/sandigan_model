				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition for Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i> filed by
petitioner Senator Jose D. Lina, Jr., principally as taxpayer, against
respondent Isidro D. Carino, in the latter's capacity as the then Secretary of
the Department of Education, Culture &amp; Sports ("DECS").  Petitioner disputes the legal authority of
respondent Carino to issue DECS Order No. 30, series of 1991, dated 11 March

the regions for guidelines responsive to the needs and conditions peculiar to
these areas, and in consideration of the regional wage orders, schools may
increase their tuition fees as approved by the State Assistance Council (SAC)
in accordance with the following guidelines:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.  <u>Entering Freshmen</u>.  The tuition fee rates for entering freshmen
in all levels may be determined by the school itself, subject to
consultation.  However, no consultation
is required when the amount of increase will raise the tuition fee level to not
more than <s>P</s>80.00 per unit for the tertiary schools and to not more than <s>P</s>1,500.00
per year for the elementary and secondary schools.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.  <u>Upper Year Students</u>.  Schools may increase their tuition fees for
the upper year students in accordance with the following prescribed rates:</blockquote>

parties and the intervenors.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in">1.  <u>Petitioner</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner basically denies the legal authority of respondent
Secretary to issue DECS Order No. 30.  It is the contention of petitioner that respondent Secretary at the time
of issuing DECS Order No. 30, no longer possessed legal authority to do so,
considering that authority to promulgate rules and regulations relating to the
imposition of school fees had been transferred to the State Assistance Council
("SAC") by Republic Act No. 6728.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, i.e. in 1987, the DECS Secretary issued an Order
authorizing private schools to increase their school fees by as much as 10% to
15% of the preceding year's rates.  The
Philippine Consumers Foundation, Inc. initiated an action questioning the legal
authority of the DECS Secretary to issue such Order on the ground that the
power of the DECS Secretary to regulate school fees did not include the power
to authorize an increase in school fees.  In <u>Philippine Consumers Foundation, Inc. v. Secretary of Education,
Culture &amp; Sports</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court rejected the argument of Philippine Consumers Foundation, Inc.
("Phil. Consumers") and held that since no other government agency
was vested with the authority to fix maximum school fees, that power should be
considered lodged with the DECS Secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is claimed by petitioner, however, that the ruling in <u>Phil.
Consumers</u> was superseded by R.A. No. 6728 which expressly conferred
authority to promulgate rules and regulations upon the SAC.  Petitioner here relies on Section 14 of R.A.
No. 6728 to sustain his position --</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 14.  <u>Program
Administration-Rules and Regulations</u>.  -- <u>The State Assistance Council shall be responsible for</u> policy
guidance and direction, monitoring and evaluation of new and existing programs,
and <u>the promulgation of rules and regulations</u>, while the Department of
Education, Culture &amp; Sports shall be responsible for the day to day
administration and program implementation.  Likewise, it may engage the services and support of any qualified
government or private entity for its implementation.</blockquote>

margin-left:22.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:0in">(Underscoring
supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also contends that DECS Order No. 30 is inconsistent
with Section 10 of R.A. No. 6728. In DECS Order No. 30 (Section 1 [d] <u>supra</u>),
respondent Secretary exempted increases in school fees other than tuition fee
(or "other school fees" as distinguished from "tuition
fee") from application of the consultation requirement.  Upon the other hand, Section 10 of R.A. No.
6728 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 10. <u>Consultation</u>. -- In any proposed increase <u>in
the rate of tuition fee</u>, there shall be appropriate consultations conducted
by the school administration with the duly organized parents and teachers
associations and faculty associations with respect to secondary schools, and
with student governments or councils, alumni and faculty associations with
respect to colleges.  For this purpose,
audited financial statements shall be made available to authorized
representatives of these sectors.  Every
effort shall be exerted to reconcile possible differences.  In case of disagreement, the alumni
association of the school or any other impartial body of their choosing shall
act as arbitrator." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">According to petitioner, Section 10 above
notwithstanding its wording, covers increases in <u>all types of school fees</u>,
which increases must first comply with the requirement of consultation before
promulgation in order that prohibitive and burdensome fees (of any type) may be
avoided.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, petitioner asks us to declare DECS Order No. 30 null and
void on two (2) grounds:  (1) that
respondent Secretary does not have the legal authority to issue that Order, and
(2) that DECS Order No. 30 violates Section 10 of R.A. No. 6728 which
established a comprehensive requirement of consultation.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in">2.  <u>Respondent Secretary</u></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, representing respondent Secretary, maintains
that the power to prescribe maximum tuition and other school fees granted under
B.P. Blg. 232 was not withdrawn by R.A. No. 6728 and remains vested in the DECS
Secretary.  The Solicitor General rests
his position here on the decision of this Court in the <u>Phil</u>. <u>Consumers</u>
case.  The Solicitor General concedes
that R.A. No. 6728 granted unto the SAC the power to promulgate rules and
regulations, but argues that only rules and regulations relevant to the purpose
of that law, i.e. government assistance and subsidy to students and teachers in
private schools, may be promulgated by the SAC.  In essence, the rules which may be promulgated by the SAC are
those involving a determination of the maximum rates of tuition fee in private
schools payment of which would not disqualify students thereof from availing
themselves of government assistance in the form of tuition fee supplements, and
from access to the high school textbook assistance fund and to tuition fee
waiver programs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General further contends that DECS Order No. 30
conforms substantially with the consultation requirement of R.A. No. 6728, <u>except</u>
item 1 (a) of DECS Order No. 30 which unqualifiedly allows private colleges and
universities to raise the tuition fee in the tertiary level to not more than <s>P</s>80.00
per unit without prior consultation.  He
therefore urges that DECS Order No. 30 be upheld, save only paragraph 1(a)
thereof which he considers to be inconsistent with the consultation
requirement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Comment in Intervention, claiming that it would be affected by the outcome of
the petition at bar. </p>

<p class="BODY">Intervenor PACU does not deny the authority of the DECS Secretary
to promulgate rules and regulations with respect to the collection, application
and use of tuition fee increases as provided in B.P. Blg. 232.  Like respondent Secretary, intervenor PACU
asks us to affirm the ruling of the Court in <u>Phil</u>. <u>Consumers</u> (<u>supra</u>).  Intervenor PACU does not believe that R.A.
No. 6728 could have repealed B.P. Blg. 232 because these two (2) statutes deal
with separate and independent subjects and were enacted for different purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Intervenor PACU questions DECS Order No. 30 only with respect to
paragraph 1 (a) which it perceives does not conform with the consultation
requirement.  Upon the other hand,
intervenor PACU, traversing the position of petitioner, asserts that Section 10
of R.A. No. 6728 refers only to increases in <u>tuition fees</u>, and that
accordingly, consultation does not apply to increases in <u>other school fees</u>,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">intervenor CEAP maintains that neither
the DECS Secretary nor the SAC may fix maximum tuition and other school fees
which private schools may lawfully charge.  In the view of intervenor CEAP, the fixing of such fees is the exclusive

and void in its entirety.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:22.5pt">Intervenor CEAP, however, adheres to
the view of intervenor PACU on consultation, that is, that the imposition of <u>other

No. 180.  Republic Act No. 6139, enacted
on August 31, 1970, provided for the regulation of tuition and other fees
charged by private schools in order to discourage the collection of exorbitant
and unreasonable fees.  In an effort to
simplify the ‘cumbersome and time consuming’ procedure prescribed under Rep.
Act No. 6139 and ‘to alleviate the sad plight of private schools,’ Pres. Dec.
No. 451 was enacted on May 11, 1974.  While this later statute was being implemented, the legislative body

same upon us -- that under Section 42 of B.P. Blg. 232, private schools are
authorized to fix and collect tuition and other school fees free from
intervention by the DECS Secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">After careful examination of the provisions of both P.D. No. 451
and B.P. Blg. 232, and the opinions of the Court in the <u>Phil</u>. <u>Consumer</u>
case and the <u>Cebu Institute</u> case, as well the lengthy pleadings filed by
the parties and the intervenors, the Court considers that the legal authority
of respondent DECS Secretary to set maximum permissible rates or levels of
tuition and other school fees, and to issue guidelines for the imposition and
collection thereof, like DECS Order No. 30, must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, we are unable to agree with intervenor CEAP that <u>Cebu
Institute</u> had the effect of withdrawing from respondent DECS Secretary the
power to regulate, and to promulgate rules and regulations relating to the
imposition and collection of tuition and other school fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">A close reading of the opinion of this Court in the <u>Cebu
Institute</u> case shows that the Court did <u>not</u> rule that the power
granted to the DECS Secretary to fix maximum permissible tuition and other
school fees by Section 1 of P.D. No. 451 had been eliminated by Section 42 of
B.P. Blg. 232.  What the Court dealt
with in the <u>Cebu Institute</u> case was the matter of the detailed
allocation of the proceeds of increases in tuition and other school fees.  In respect of <u>this specific question</u>,
there is no dispute that Section 42 of B.P. Blg. 232 <u>did</u> modify P.D. No.
451 by authorizing the DECS Secretary to issue rules and regulations relating
to the detailed allocation of funds raised by tuition and other fee increases
to various categories of uses and expenditures.  What the Court, through Cortes, <u>J</u>., did say in the <u>Cebu
Institute</u> case was the following:<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x What then was the effect of B.P. Blg. 232 on Pres. Dec.
No. 451?</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court after comparing section 42 of B.P. Blg. 232 and Pres.
Dec. No. 451, particularly section 3(a) thereof, finds evident irreconcilable
differences.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under Pres. Dec. No. 451, the authority to regulate the imposition
of tuition and other school fees or charges by private schools is lodged with
the Secretary of Education and Culture (Sec. 1), where <u>section 42 of B.P.
Blg. 232 liberalized private school to determine its rate of tuition and  other school fees or charges</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Pres. Dec. No. 451 provides that 60%
of the incremental proceeds of tuition fee increases shall be applied or used
to augment the salaries and wages</u> of members of the faculty and other
employees of the school, while <u>B.P. Blg. 232 provides that the increment
shall be applied or used in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the
MECS</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>A closer look at these differences leads the Court to resolve the
question in favor of repeal.  As pointed
out by the Solicitor General, three aspects of the disputes provisions of law
support the above conclusion.  <u>First</u>,
the legislative authority under Pres. Dec. No. 451 retained the power to
apportion the incremental proceeds of the tuition fee increases; such power is
delegated to the Ministry of Education and Culture under B.P. Blg. 232.  <u>Second</u>, Pres. Dec. No. 451 limits the
application or use of the increment to salary or wage increase, institutional
development, student assistance and extension services and return on
investment, whereas B.P. Blg. 232 gives the MECS discretion to determine the
application or use of the increments.  <u>Third</u>,
the extent of the application or use of the increment under Pres. Dec. 451 is
fixed at the pre-determined percentage allocations:  60% for wage and salary increases, 12% for return in investment
and the balance of 28% to institutional development, student assistance and
extension services while under B.P. Blg. 232, the extent of the allocation or
use of increment is likewise left to the discretion of the MECS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The legislative intent to depart from the statutory limitations
under Pres. Dec. No. 451 is apparent in the second sentence of section 42 of
B.P. Blg. 232  <u>Pres. Dec. No. 451 and
section 42 of B.P. Blg. 232</u> which cover the same subject matter <u>are so
clearly inconsistent and incompatible with each other that there is no other
conclusion but that the latter repeals the former</u> in accordance with
section 72 of B.P. Blg. 232 to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:
3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having concluded that <u>under B.P. Blg. 232 the Collection and
application or use of tuition and other school fees are subject only to the
limitations under the rules and regulations issued by the Ministry</u>, the
crucial point now shifts to the said implementing rules."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, an examination of the precise language or Section 42 of
B.P. Blg. 232 shows that there is really nothing in Section 42 which must be
read as eliminating the power of the DECS Secretary in respect of the fixing of
maximum tuition and other school fees vested in him by P.D. No. 451. Under
Section 42, a private school may determine for itself <u>in the first instance</u>
the rate of tuition and other school fees or charges that it deems
appropriate.  Such determination by the
private school is not, however, binding and conclusive as against the Secretary
of Education, Culture and Sports.  The
rates and charges adopted by such private school "shall be collectible,
and their application or use authorized" <u>provided</u> that such rates
and charges are in accord with rules and regulations promulgated by the DECS.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is convenient to quote Section 42 again:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 42.  <u>Tuition
and Other School Fees</u>.  -­-<u>Each
private school shall determine its rate of tuition and other school fees or
charges.  The rates and charges adopted</u>
by schools pursuant to this provision shall be <u>collectible</u>, and their
application or use authorized, <u>subject to rules and regulations promulgated
by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports</u>." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">We do <u>not</u> read the first sentence
of Section 42 as granting an <u>unlimited</u> power to private schools to
establish any rate of tuition and other school fees and charges that it may
desire and to enforce collection of such fees or charges from students.  We think it entirely clear that the second
sentence of Section 42 is a <u>limiting</u> provision, that is, a provision
which, far from authorizing a private school to adopt any level of tuition and
other school fees or charges no matter how exorbitant, <u>subjects the schedule
of rates and charges adopted by a particular school to the rules and
regulations promulgated by the DECS</u>.  Thus, the rates and charges adopted by any given private school shall be
"collectible", i.e., enforceable against the students and their
parents to the extent that they are consistent with DECS rules and
regulations.  Put a little differently,
the second sentence of Section 42 deals with two (2) distinguishable
subjects:  (a) the enforceability of
rates of fees and charges adopted by private schools; and (b) the
enforceability of proposed applications or uses of the proceeds of such school
fees or charges -- and <u>both</u> are declared subject to rules and
regulations promulgated by the DECS.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the argument of petitioner Lina that the DECS
Secretary was divested of his authority to promulgate rules and regulations
relating to the fixing of tuition and other school fees, by R.A. No. 6728, and
that such authority has been transferred instead to the SAC.  The Court is unable to agree with this
contention.  We do not see how R.A. No.
6728 could be regarded as vesting upon the SAC the legal authority to establish
maximum permissible tuition and other school fees for private schools.  As earlier noted, R.A. No. 6728 deals with
government assistance to students and teachers in private schools; it does not,
in other words, purport to deal at with the question of authority to fix
maximum collectible tuition and other school fees.  R.A. No. 6728 did authorize the SAC to issue rules and
regulations; but the rules and regulations which may be promulgated by the SAC
must relate to the authority granted by R.A. No. 6728 to the SAC.  It is axiomatic that a rule or regulation
must bear upon, and be consistent with, the provisions of the enabling statute
if such rule or regulation is to be valid.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The SAC was authorized to define the classes of students who may be entitled to
claim government financial assistance.  Under the statute, students of schools charging tuition and other school
fees in excess of certain identified rates or levels thereof shall not be entitled
to claim government assistance or subsidies.  The specification of such levels of tuition and other school fees for
purposes of qualifying (or disqualifying) the students in such schools for
government financial assistance is one thing:  this is the task SAC was authorized to carry out though the promulgation
of rules and regulations.  The
determination of the levels of tuition and other school fees which may lawfully
be charged by any private school, is clearly another matter; this task is
vested in respondent Secretary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is hardly necessary to add that the Court, in reaching the
above conclusion is not saying that every paragraph add sub-paragraph of DECS
Order No. 30 is necessarily valid and consistent with the provisions of the
enabling statute(s).  We do not
understand the parties to be asking us to validate or strike down every such
paragraph and sub-paragraph.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the second principal issue, petitioner Lina
contends that section 1(d) of DECS Order No. 30 is inconsistent with Section 10
of R.A. No. 6728.  We have earlier
pointed out that petitioner's stand is inconsistent with the very language used
in Section 10 of R.A. No. 6728 which states in relevant part that: "in any
proposed increase <u>in the rate of tuition fees</u>, there shall be appropriate
consultations ---." Petitioner Lina's argument here is, however,
essentially an invocation of "justice and equity." Petitioner argues
that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x [T]here is no basis, legal or otherwise, for the
respondent Secretary to view 'other fees' as separate and distinct from
'tuition fee rate' for purposes of the consultation requirement of the
law.  To exclude the imposition of
'other fees' from the consultation process would result in an anomalous
situation whereby so-called 'other fees' may become so burdensome that the
students and parents concerned may be deprived of the right of being heard or
consulted on matter directly affecting their interest.  <u>Justice and equity demand that any
increase in the tuition fee, tuition fee assessment or 'other fees' which in
its totality increases the cost of education, should and must be subjected to
consultation</u>, as required in Section 10, R.A. No. 6728."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">14</span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court believes that petitioner's argument -- cogent though it
may be as a social and economic comment -- is most appropriately addressed, not
to a court which must take the law as it is actually written, but rather to the
legislative authority which can, if it wishes, change the language and content
of the law.  As Section 10 of R.A. No.
6728 now stands, we have no authority to strike down paragraph 1 (d) of DECS
Order No. 30 as inconsistent with the requirements of Section 10.</p>

<p class="BODY">Summarizing, the first issue we must answer in the
affirmative.  To the second issue, we
must give a negative answer.</p>

The Secretary of Justice has rendered an opinion (Opinion No. 156, Series of
1989) dealing with the inter­relations of the various provisions of R.A. No.
6728 and suggesting that Section 10 of R.A. No. 6728 does not apply to
situations contemplated in Sections 5(1) (a) and 9 (a) of that law, but that
Section 10 should apply only to Sections 5(1) (b), 9 (b), and 9 (c).  Paragraph 1 (a) of DECS Order No. 30
allegedly falls under Section 9 (c) of R.A. No. 6728.</p>
