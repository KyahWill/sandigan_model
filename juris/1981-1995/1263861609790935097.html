				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before the Court is a motion filed by the respondent seeking a
reconsideration of the decision of this Court dated <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1988</st1:date> suspending respondent indefinitely
from the practice of law until such time when he can demonstrate that he has

UNTIMELY DEATH AS A MEMBER OF THE BAR, AS PROVINCIAL FISCAL AND AS A
CITIZEN."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the said decision, the Court found respondent guilty of
unethical practices in:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) causing his
client to perjure himself; (2) that he lacks candor and respect towards his
adversary and the courts; and (3) that he had been abusive of his right of
recourse to the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first charge, the Court found that respondent filed a
verified complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> docketed as Civil
Case No. 192 in the Municipal Court of Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>,
Laguna wherein it is alleged that in the early part of <u>1960</u> defendant
Julian <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> dispossessed plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of a portion of
the property in question, while in an amended complaint it is alleged that <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> deprived <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> of a
portion of said property in the early part of <u>1973</u> to enable the
inferior court to acquire jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent now argues that he filed the said pleadings in good
faith and that he had no intention to cause his client to commit perjury.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stressed that <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
had been a <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> occupant of the property in question even
before 1958 and that his right was recognized by the Director of Lands in a
decision dated August 13, 1962; that said property is an alienable portion of
public land known as Camp Eldridge at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Bambang</span>, Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>, Laguna which
is disposable under Republic Acts No. 274 and 730, with preferential right
expressly given to actual occupants as <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>; and
that all he did was to exert his utmost and relentless time and effort in
defending the cause of his poor, oppressed and unlettered landless client.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second and third charges for lacking candor towards his
adversary and the courts and for abusing his right of recourse to the courts,
respondent asserts that he only did his duty to protect the interests of his
client.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedents are the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case in
the Municipal Court of Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>, Laguna against <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> on <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="4">April
 13, 1974</st1:date>, docketed as Civil Case No. 192.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A writ of preliminary mandatory injunction
was issued by the trial court on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="5">May
 21, 1974</st1:date> restoring <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> in the
possession of the property upon his filing a bond.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:315.0pt">On May 15, 1974, respondent as counsel
of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, filed in the Court of First Instance (CFI)
of Laguna an action for the annulment of the title of <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>
docketed as Civil Case No. 179-C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
denied on <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1976</st1:date>
for lack of cause of action and lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1974</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> filed an action for
recovery of possession of the property against <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
also in the CFI of Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. 183.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case was resolved in favor of <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> and was appealed by <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
to the Court of Appeals where it is still pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1977</st1:date>,
the Municipal Court dismissed Civil Case No. 192 for lack of jurisdiction and
the writ issued was dissolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
judgment was not executed as <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> appealed to the
CFI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the appeal was
dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the judgment had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>
filed an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for the
execution of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent filed
an opposition stating that he filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the CFI
of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In deference to the same, the
Municipal Court held in abeyance further action on the <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>
motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 1, 1977, respondent filed in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> an action against the Director of Lands and <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> in the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) in San
Pablo, Laguna for a determination of the preferential acquisitive rights and/or
security of tenure of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> under Republic Acts No.
274 and 730 and Presidential Decrees No. 27 and 152 and Land Administrative
Order No. 29.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
CAR Case No. 7043.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion of respondent, the CAR issued a
restraining order on July 2, 1977 enjoining the Director of Lands and <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> from enforcing an earlier decision of the Director
of Lands dated May 27, 1964 recognizing the prior right of <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>
to the questioned property and reversing his decision dated August 13, 1962
awarding to <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> the preferential right to the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this case was also
dismissed on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1979</st1:date>
for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal,
said decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent argues that in all these cases that he filed in court
his primary interest was to defend what he believes is the lawful cause of his
client <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that he filed the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Aquino's</span>
possession and preferential right to the property had been upheld in the
decision of the Director of Lands dated <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="8">August
 13, 1962</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the
Director of Lands, in a subsequent decision dated May 27, 1964, reversed
himself and sustained the claim of <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> over the
property, respondent alleges that said decision is null and void on the ground
that the same is against public policy and that it was procured through deceit,
fraud, corruption and undue influence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also refers to Resolution No. 9, S-72 dated <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1972</st1:date> of the Presidential Action
Committee on Justice and Agrarian Reform which in effect set aside said
decision as it ordered a relocation survey of the property to determine once
and for all the conflicting claims of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:310.5pt">Respondent explains that these are the
reasons why he filed the action for annulment of the title of <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He states
that he filed the complaint in the agrarian court also to enforce the right of <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> as a tenant tilling the land who is given
preferential right to the property under the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He emphasizes that he did not deceive the CAR
when he sought the issuance of a restraining order against the enforcement of
the decision of the Director of Lands inasmuch as the parties had submitted
their controversy to arbitration by then Secretary <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
Zamora, Presidential Assistant on Legal Affairs,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
but <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> reneged on this agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent concludes that <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span>
and his counsel are responsible for the protracted litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In March, 1988, an order of execution was issued by the trial
court pending appeal of Civil Case 183-C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was effectively dispossessed of
the property in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The filing of this administrative complaint on <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date>, notwithstanding,
respondent went on with his practice of law for several years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Most of his clients were poor/landless and
indigent tenant-farmers from Laguna and <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and from <span class="SpellE">Parañaque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bayumbong</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Jala-Jala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1987</st1:date>,
he represented the Laguna chapter of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines
(IBP) in the Government/NPC, Laguna Committee on Reconciliation and Ceasefire.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> appointed him Municipal
Councilor of Sta. Cruz, Laguna.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon recommendation of the then Minister of Justice and the
officials and members of the Laguna chapter of the IBP attesting to his
probity, integrity, trustworthiness, exemplary life and character,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> appointed him Provincial Fiscal of
Laguna<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which position he assumed on February 9, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon his suspension from the practice of law by this Court, he took an
indefinite leave of absence effective <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="8">August
 11, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent points out that except for this administrative case,
no complaint, whether civil or criminal, had ever been filed against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also points out that he performed his duty
as government prosecutor with dedication so much so that he received an award
of appreciation from the PC/INP Command of Laguna.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent adds that since 1978, he joined the <span class="SpellE">Cursillo</span>
movement, the Christian charismatic movement and the Christian Family
Movement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also appears that he is a
YMCA director and life member.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Respondent also contends
that when he handled the case of <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, his only motivation was to defend him from
oppression and to protect him against a rich landowner, and that he received no
monetary remuneration for his long and dedicated service except some tokens in
the form of vegetable crops as <span class="SpellE">camotes</span>, guavas,
mangos, star apples, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He maintains
that all his actuations were predicated on good faith and the honest belief
that they were proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation, the Office of the Solicitor General
recommended a suspension of six (6) months from the practice of law as
penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent has been suspended
since <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1988</st1:date>, or
for a period of about ten (10) months to date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is due to retire as Provincial Fiscal of Laguna in July, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful reexamination of the records of the case shows that the
acts of respondent may be attributed to his extreme zeal and enthusiasm in
prosecuting the cause of his client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no proof of any dishonest motive or fraud, much less of any
contemptuous act committed by him towards the courts or towards the adverse
party or counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the courses of
action he took tended to delay the disposition of the controversy and were
redundant, his suspension from the practice of law is sufficient disciplinary
action against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is
proof that the fault cannot be attributed entirely to the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant and his counsel also contributed
to the delay in filing Civil Case No. 183 for recovery of possession, which is
still pending appeal, and in failing to comply with the agreement to settle the
dispute by arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent and
his client <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> were willing to settle the problem
but <span class="SpellE">Estolano</span> and his counsel did not care to pursue
this course of action which could have terminated the matter once and for all.</p>

<p class="BODY">The attestations of responsible persons in the public and private
sector as to the integrity and good moral character of respondent show that he
has rehabilitated himself as to deserve another chance to resume the practice
of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is GRANTED in
that the suspension of respondent from the practice of law is hereby
lifted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This resolution is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FELICIANO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I am compelled to dissent from the majority opinion basically for
the reason that, in my view, the Resolution on the Motion for Reconsideration
has reversed the unanimous decision of this Court dated July 29, 1988 which
"suspended indefinitely [the respondent] from the practice of law from
date of notice until such time that he can demonstrate to the Court that he has
rehabilitated himself and deserves to resume the practice of law." This
Court may, of course, reverse itself on a motion for reconsideration where it
finds that indeed it had committed serious error in rendering its original
decision or resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
Court must, I respectfully submit, specify the <u>basis</u> which it has found
sufficient for reversing its earlier unanimous decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant administrative case, the majority resolution on
respondent's Motion for Reconsideration omits any indication of any adequate
legal or factual basis for reversing itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its original Decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1988</st1:date>, the Court found respondent Atty. Villanueva
guilty of the following unethical practices with which he had been charged:</p>

<blockquote>"[1] that respondent had caused his client to perjure himself;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>[2<span class="GramE">]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that</span> he lacks candor and respect
toward his adversary and the courts; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>[3<span class="GramE">]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that</span> he had been abusive of the right
of recourse to the courts." (Decision, pp. 5-6)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The original decision
found that:</p>

<blockquote>"Anent the first charge, the complaint and amended complaint
for forcible entry in Civil Case No. 192 filed by respondent's client are <u>clear
proofs that respondent had indeed caused his client <span class="SpellE">Glicerio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> to perjure himself as to the date he lost
possession of the subject property so as to place the case within the
jurisdiction of the court.”</u> (Decision, p. 6; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court went on to say that:</p>

<blockquote>"Such action of respondent counsel is <u>a clear violation of
his oath</u> that ‘he will do no falsehood nor consent to the doing of any in
court.’ A <span class="GramE">legal</span> counsel is of course expected to
defend his client's cause with zeal <u>but not at the disregard of truth</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>He violated his oath <span class="GramE">of<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>office</span> when he resorted to deception</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Instead of safeguarding the interests of his client as
his responsibility dictates, he did exactly the opposite by <u>causing his
client to commit a felony</u>." (Decision, pp. 7-8; underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. In respect of the second charge against respondent, the Court
in its original decision made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, the manner in which respondent counsel handled the
forcible entry case filed against the client of complainant shows his <u>total
lack of candor and respect for the courts and the rights of his adversary</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had employed every step necessary to
forestall complainant's client from taking rightful possession of subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has <u>shown utter disregard of the proper
rules of procedure to suit his purpose</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While he filed his urgent <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>
motion for clarification, he chose not to wait for its resolution and instead
perfected his appeal to the Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When finally the decision became <span class="SpellE">executory</span> because of his failure to appeal to the Court of
Appeals, he filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> against the decision of the
CFI <u>which petition is obviously frivolous and a mere tactic to delay
enforcement of the court's decision</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the meantime, the clients of respondent refused to obey the order of
execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A lawyer should obey all lawful orders and rulings of the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <u>should have counseled his
clients to submit to the order of the court instead of encouraging them to
resist such order</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">actuations of respondent of employing dilatory tactics by <u>filing
a clearly frivolous case amounts</u></span><u> to obstruction of the
administration of justice</u> which constitutes <u>misconduct</u> and justifies
disciplinary action against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent counsel <u>further demonstrated his questionable motive
by filing another case</u>, this time for annulment of the title of
complainant's client to the other 2-1/2 hectares of subject land with the Court
of First Instance of Laguna, Branch VI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This case was dismissed on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> and prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent appealed this ruling to the Court
of Appeals where it was pending resolution at the time the instant complaint
for disbarment was filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision
of the trial court was affirmed and remanded to the lower court for execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Not satisfied with the above-mentioned appeal, <u>respondent
counsel brought another case against complainant's client this time before the
Court of Agrarian Relations</u> (CAR Case No. 7043) for determination allegedly
of who had a better right over the subject property <u>when he was well aware
of the absence of any tenancy relationship between the parties</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An examination of the records shows that <u>respondent did not
disclose before the Court of Agrarian Relations (CAR) prior lawsuits and
decisions rendered relative to the subject land</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Decision, pp. 9-11; underscoring supplied;
citations omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3. In respect of the third charge against him, the findings of the
Court in its original decision were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The cause of respondent's clients is obviously bereft of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent was aware of this fact</u>
so he resorted to <u>forum shopping</u>, continuously seeking the court where
he may possibly obtain favorable judgment, thereby adding to the already clogged
dockets of the courts with the <u>unmeritorious cases he filed</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <u>grossly abused his right of recourse to
the courts</u> by <u>filing multiple petitions</u> or complaints for a cause
that had been previously rejected in the false hope of getting some favorable
action, somehow, thus, <u>obstructing the administration of justice</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>He was derelict in his duty</u> as counsel
<u>to maintain such actions or proceedings only as appears to him to be just</u>,
and such defenses only as he believes to be honestly debatable under the
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had thus <u>prostituted his
office at the expense of justice</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The practice of law is a privilege accorded only to those who
measure up to certain standards of mental and moral fitness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For a counsel who has been sworn to assist in
the administration of justice and to uphold the rule of law, <u>respondent has
miserably failed to live up to the standards expected of a member of the Bar</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of assisting in the speedy
disposition of cases, he made a mockery of our system of justice, thus
deserving to be censured and penalized by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, respondent is guilty of <u>gross
misconduct in office</u>." (Decision, pp. 12-13, underscoring supplied;
citations omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its present Resolution on the Motion for Reconsideration, the
majority's findings are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"A careful re-examination of the records of the case shows
that the acts of respondent may be attributed to <u>his extreme zeal and
enthusiasm in prosecuting the cause of his client</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is <u>no proof of any dishonest motive
or fraud</u>, much less of <u>any contemptuous act</u> committed by him <u>towards
the courts or towards the adverse party or counsel</u>." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully submit that the above subsequent findings are
quite inconsistent with the findings set out in the original unanimous decision
of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is very difficult to
understand how "a <u>clear violation of [the lawyer's] oath</u>",
"<u>deception</u>", "<u>lack of candor and honesty</u> [towards]
the courts and his adversary", "<u>utter disregard of the proper
rules on procedure</u> to suit his purpose", "<u>obstruction of the
administration of justice</u>", "questionable motive", knowingly
filing suits which are "<u>obviously bereft of merit</u>", "<u>forum
shopping</u>", "<span class="SpellE"><u>prostitut</u></span><u>[<span class="SpellE">ing</span>] his office at the expense of justice</u>" and
"miserably <u>fail[<span class="SpellE">ing</span>] to live up to the standards
expected of the member of the Bar</u>" can be reasonably attributed to
respondent's "<u>extreme zeal</u> and <u>enthusiasm</u> in prosecuting the
cause of his client." Moreover, I am unable to understand what proof of
"dishonest motive or fraud" or "contemptuous act" the
majority is looking for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>nature
and character of the acts</u> of which respondent attorney was found guilty by
the Court in its original decision is such that they only could have been
committed with "dishonest motive[s]." At the very least, it was incumbent
upon respondent to prove that notwithstanding the obvious nature of those acts,
he in fact acted from some pure and commendable internal motive visible only to
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent attorney has not,
however, submitted any such proof other than his own assertion that he had
acted "in good faith and fidelity" for "his poor and unlettered
client.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The present majority resolution refers to a number of
circumstances relating to respondent attorney, such as:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>his having represented tenant-farmers from
Laguna, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; his appointment as Provincial Fiscal of
Laguna on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="2">9 February 1987</st1:date>;
his having joined the <span class="SpellE">Cursillo</span>, Christian Charismatic
and Christian Family Movements; and his being a YMCA Director and life
member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without detracting from whatever
merit one may find in these circumstances, it should be pointed out that none
of the circumstances appear to have materialized <u>after </u><st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="7"><u>July 29, 1988</u></st1:date>, the date of the
promul­gation of the original decision of this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, they do not appear to be proof that
respondent attorney has "<u>rehabilitated</u> himself." Finally,
assuming that the above circumstances materialized after <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1988</st1:date>, I do not believe that such, by
themselves and without more, would constitute adequate proof that respondent
attorney has indeed <u>rehabilitated himself.</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, I vote for DENYING the Motion for Reconsideration.</p>
