<p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition 
<span>W</span>ith Preliminary Injunction seeking to annul the Order<span> of 
respondent Court dated August 13, 1971 and to prohibit respondent Court from 
proceeding in any manner with Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) for alleged lack of 
jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the 
questioned Order (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 57) reads as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, let a restraining order be issued directing the 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> and Company, Limited Partnership, 
not to fence the land in question or continue with the fencing thereof or, from 
threatening and actually obstructing, molesting and/or preventing by force the 
entry to, and/or exit from, the said land the plaintiffs and their families, or 
from constructing network of roads, streets and canals thereon, or from 
introducing any other improvements thereon, or otherwise exercising rights of 
possession and dominion thereon until further orders from this 
Court.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"In the meantime, let the petition for issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction <span class="GramE">be</span> set for hearing on <st1:date month="8" day="28" year="1971">August 28, 1971</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00 a.m.</st1:time>"</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The facts of the case are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner is the duly registered owner of several adjacent 
parcels of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Ugong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, bounded by <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> Ave., E. 
Rodriguez, Jr. Ave. and Escarpment Road, containing an area of 162 hectares, 
more or less, consolidated into one parcel, under TCT-No. <span class="GramE">227758 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Said parcel is a portion of the 
<span class="SpellE">Mandaluyon</span> Estate (also sometimes known as 
"<em>Hacienda de Mandaloya</em>", "<em>Hacienda de Mandaloyen</em>", 
"<em>Hacienda de Mandaloyoa", etc</em>.) over which Petitioner, thru its 
predecessor-in-interest, the “<span class="SpellE"><em>Provincia</em></span><em> 
del Santisima</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Nombre</em></span><em> de Jesus de 
Agustinos</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Calzados</em></span>," has been in 
continuous possession since 1862 or 125 years </span>ago, as confirmed by the 
Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Compañia</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Agricola</em></span><em> de Ultramar v. Marcos Domingo, et 
al.</em>, 6 Phil. 246 (1906), when it affirmed the decision of the Court of Land 
Registration declaring the <span class="SpellE">Compañia</span> <span class="SpellE">Agricola</span> de Ultramar, also one of petitioner's 
predecessors-in-interest, owner of the lands in question to the exclusion of the 
claims of contestants or any persons holding under them.</p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1967, Civil Case No. 7-M (10339) was filed against 
petitioner by a certain Pedro del Rosario and three others, in their own behalf 
and in behalf of 104 others, as a class suit, in the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, seeking, among other things, the declaration of 
petitioner's titles null and void, allegedly for lack of publication in the land 
registration proceeding from which they were derived and for alleged fraud 
employed in registering under Act No. 496 certain parcels of agricultural land 
in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
63) which form part of the <span class="SpellE">Mandaloyon</span> Estate (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 9) and the declaration of plaintiffs 
thereon as lawful owners and possessors of their respective landholdings.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In this case, respondent Court issued a restraining order 
<em>ex-parte</em>, still in force and effect when the instant petition was 
filed.</p>
<p class="BODY">In view of the adverse decision rendered by respondent Court, 
petitioner filed a motion for new trial within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period on the ground of newly discovered 
evidence (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 9) which motion was 
denied by respondent Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>As a result, petitioner was 
cons<span>trained to go up on <i><em>certiorari</em></i> to the Court of 
Appeals, </span>which enjoined respondent Court from taking any further action 
in Civil Case No. 7-M (10339) (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
76).<span>&nbsp; </span>As of the filing of this petition here in the Supreme Court, 
the case was still pending decision with the Court of Appeals, as to whether 
respondent Court should be ordered to grant a new trial for the reception of new 
evidence (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 10).</p>
<p class="BODY">On August 10, 1971, Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) was filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Bernardo and five others for and in their 
own behalf and in behalf of 37 others against petitioner, filed as a class suit 
concerning another portion of the <span class="SpellE">Mandaloyon</span> Estate, 
containing an aggregate area of 1,923,454 sq. meters.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
complaint is generally identical to that of Civil Case No. 7-M (10339), and 
seeks, as in the aforementioned case, that the original certificates of title 
nos. 13, 33, 336, 337 and 344 be declared null and void for lack of publication 
in the land registration proceeding and certain transfer certificates of title 
of petitioner derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, more specifically TCT 
Nos. 227758, 35749, 35750 and 100110, and for alleged fraud in registering the 
parcels of land being claimed by plaintiffs therein; and that the plaintiffs be 
declared as lawful owners and possessors of their respective landholdings (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 48).</p>
<p class="BODY">An urgent <em>ex-parte</em> motion of private respondents 
(plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 678-M [15043]), opposing among others, 
petitioner's construction of fences and high walls, roads, streets and canals on 
the land in dispute, having been filed (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 60), respondent <span>Court issued the 
afore-quoted questioned Order of August 13, 1971.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>Hence, this 
petition.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

motion to dismiss the petition on <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1971">August 24, 1971</st1:date> for being premature and for lack of merit 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 110) which motion was opposed by 
petitioner by motion filed on <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1971">August 
24, 1971</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 120).</p>
<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, petitioner as defendant in Civil Case No. 678-M 
(15043), filed with respondent Court their Answer with Counterclaim dated August 
24, 1971 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 174) and an Opposition to 
plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction with counter-motion for issuance 
of preliminary injunction and/or restraining order against plaintiffs dated 
August 26, 1971.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the same date, petitioner filed with the lower 
court an omnibus motion praying for the Court to order the dropping of persons 
as plaintiffs, except <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> Bernardo for improper 
class suit pursuant to Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, and the payment 
by plaintiff of the correct amount of filing fees based on the assessed value of 
the property involved which is P2<span class="GramE">,242,150.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioner also filed in the lower court a motion to lift restraining 
order of <st1:date month="8" day="13" year="1971">August 13, 1971</st1:date>, 
dated <st1:date month="8" day="26" year="1971">August 26, 1971</st1:date> 
also.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1971">August 24, 
1971</st1:date>, respondents filed a motion to dismiss (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 110-111) but the Court required them in 
the resolution of <st1:date month="8" day="25" year="1971">August 25, 
1971</st1:date> to file an answer to the petition and set the case for hearing 
on <st1:date month="9" day="3" year="1971">September <span>3, 
1971</span></st1:date><span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p.

1971</span></st1:date><span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p.

<p class="BODY">At the hearing the parties argued their respective causes and 
petitioner was required to file a reply to respondents' answer (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 240).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="6" year="1971">September 6, 
1971</st1:date>, petitioner filed a manifestation informing this Court of the 
incident report from its security guard with pictures showing the extent of the 
damage caused by respondents to petitioner's walls on the property in question 
for record purposes in view of their materiality and pertinence to the instant 
petition (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 241).</p>
<p class="BODY">On the same date, petitioner filed with the lower court an urgent 
manifestation and motion asking respondent Court to resolve petitioner's pending 
motions, especially its motion to lift restraining order of <st1:date month="8" day="13" year="1971">August 13, 1971</st1:date> and the omnibus motion (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 398).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="9" day="8" year="1971"><span>September 8, 1971</span></st1:date><span>, petitioner filed a 
Reply to the Answer of respondents to the petition (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 255).<span>&nbsp; </span>On the same date, 
respondents filed a manifestation containing their proposals in compliance with 
the Order of the Court during the hearing of the case on September 3, 1971, that 
parties execute an agreement between themselves that would govern the <em>status 
</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;">quo</span> <span>in their 
relationship over the land in question while still litigating against each other 
under Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and Civil Case Nos. 2028 to 2098 For Forcible Entry in 
the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
379).<span>&nbsp; </span>On the same date, petitioner filed its manifestation 
informing the Court that parties failed to enter into such agreement (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 246) for which reason the Court resolved 
to require respondents to comment thereon (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 391).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On September 10, 1971, defendant Company (petitioner herein) filed 
another urgent manifestation and motion with respondent Court, reiterating its 
urgent manifestation and motion of September 6, 1971, urging respondent Court to 
immediately resolve the urgent questions pending before it, most especially 
petitioner's motion to lift respondent Court's restraining order, and the 
omnibus motion, both dated August 26, 1971 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 402).</p>
<p class="BODY">On September 16, 1971, petitioner filed another manifestation 
informing the Court, among others, that it is not waiving its petition on file 
with the Court and that respondent Court had not yet acted upon its motion to 
lift the restraining order of August 13, 1971, dated August 26, 1971 for which 
inaction petitioner <span>has </span>been definitely restrained from performing 
any act of ownership and dominion over almost 200 hectares of land (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 394).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="2" year="1971">October 2, 
1971</st1:date>, petitioner filed a manifestation explaining why it failed to 
enter into an agreement with respondents as required <span>by </span>the Court 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 404).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In </span>the resolution of October 12, 1971, the Supreme 
Court directed <span>the issuance </span>of a writ of preliminary 
<span>injunction upon petitioner's filing of a bond in the sum of ten thousand 
pesos (P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), enjoining respondent Court from 
enforcing the restraining order issued by it on August 13, 1971 and from 
proceeding in any manner with Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) until further orders 
by the Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 421).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The corresponding writ was issued on </span><st1:date month="10" day="14" year="1971"><span>October 14, 1971</span></st1:date><span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 422).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><st1:date month="8" day="13" year="1971"><span class="GramE">AUGUST 13, 
1971</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is undisputed that petitioner is the duly registered 
owner of the land in dispute as evidenced by OCT Nos. 13, 33, 334, 336 and 337 
by virtue of Decrees Nos. 240, 1942 and 1425 issued in GLRO Record Nos. 699, 875 
and 917 of the Philippine Government.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, private respondents 
admitted that much in their complaint in Civil Case No. 15043 entitled 
"<em>Bernardo et al. v. The Director of Bureau of Lands, et al</em>." filed in 
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 50), although they claim that the present 
title of petitioner TCT No. 227758 is itself void, regardless of source (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 141).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Likewise undisputed is the fact that respondent Judge has 
declared that GLRO Record No. 917 and Decree No. 1425 are null and void in Civil 
Case No. 7-M (10339) entitled "<em>Pedro del Rosario, et al. v. Ortigas and 
Company Ltd. Partnership, et al</em>." for alleged lack of publication (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 50).<span>&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless such 
decision has not become final, because of a petition for injunction filed in the 
Court of </span>Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 10339-R where respondent Judge was 
immediately enjoined by said appellate court from proceeding <span>in </span>the 
aforesaid case and the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City and <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to desist from taking any action 
<span>involving the Original Certificates of Titles of the petitioner (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 76).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Furthermore, the fact of continuous possession by the 
petitioner thru its predecessor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Provincia</span> 
del <span class="SpellE">Santisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Nombre</span> de 
Jesus de <span class="SpellE">Agustinos</span> <span class="SpellE">Calzados</span> 
since 1862 or 125 years ago has as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, been 
confirmed by the Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Compañia</em></span> 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Agricola</em></span><em> de Ultramar v. Marcos 
</em></span><em>Domingo, et al</em>. (6 Phil. 246 [1906]).<span>&nbsp; </span>That 
decision is without question, decisive in the instant case.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
held by the Court some years ago, through Justice J.B.L. Reyes "a ruling 
constituting the law of the case, even if erroneous ... may no longer be 
disturbed or modified since it has become final..." (<em>NWSA v. NWSA 
Consolidated Union, et al.</em>, 27 SCRA 227 [1969], citing <em>People v. 
Olarte</em>, 19 SCRA 494 [1967]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Balmes</em></span><em> 
v. Suson</em>, 28 SCRA 304 [1969]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Mangayao</em></span><em> v. Guzman</em>, 55 SCRA 540 [1974]; 
<em>National Mines and Allied Workers Union [NAMAWU-MIF] v. Luna</em><span>, 83 
</span>SCRA <span>607 [1978]; </span><em>Solis v. People</em><span class="GramE">, 
84 SCRA 377 [1978]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The law of the case does not apply to 
what is embodied in the decision solely but also to its implementation carried 
out in fealty to what has been decreed (<span class="SpellE"><em>Libudan</em></span><em> v. Panma Gil</em>, 45 SCRA 17 
[1972]).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the basis of such facts, it is clearly evident that the 
restraining order issued by the lower court is improper and without 
basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">But just as important is the well-settled rule that injunction 
will not lie to take the property out of the control of the party in possession 
(<em>PNB v. Adil</em>, 118 SCRA 117 [1982]).<span>&nbsp; </span>In a similar case, 
the Court ruled that in actions involving realty, preliminary injunction will 
lie only after the plaintiff has fully established his title or right thereto by 
a proper action for the purpose.<span>&nbsp; </span>To authorize a temporary 
injunction, the complainant must make out at least a <em>prima facie</em> 
showing of a right to the final relief.<span>&nbsp; </span>Preliminary injunction 
will not issue to protect a right not <em>in esse</em> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Buayan</em></span><em> Cattle Co. Inc. v. Quintillan</em>, 128 
SCRA 286-287 [1984]).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Two requisites are necessary if a preliminary 
injunc</span><span>tion </span><span>is to </span><span>issue, namely, 
</span><span>the existence of the right to be protected, and the facts against 
which the injunction is to be directed are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> 
of said right.<span>&nbsp; </span>In particular, for a writ of preliminary injunction 
to issue, the existence of the right and the violation must appear in the 
allegation of the complaint and a preliminary injunction is proper only when the 
plaintiff appears to be entitled to the relief demanded in his complaint.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Furthermore, the complaint for injunctive relief must be construed 
strictly against the pleader (<span class="SpellE"><em>Buayan</em></span><em> 
Cattle Co. Inc. v. Quintillan, supra</em>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0pt;" class="BODY">Respondents anchor their claim on the 
decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 7-M (10339), (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 89) which, however, has not become final, 
apart from the fact that as petitioner pointed out both groups of plaintiffs in 
Civil Case No. 7-M (10339) and Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) are claiming the 
same lots, Lots 49 and 50, PSU-25901.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 52-A, par.</span> [<span class="GramE">d</span>] and pp. 66-67 [b]).</p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, the existence of a "clear positive right" especially calling 
for judicial protection has not been shown.<span>&nbsp; </span>As held by the Court, 
injunction is not to protect contingent or future right; nor is it a remedy to 
enforce an abstract right (<span class="SpellE"><em>Yaptinchay</em></span><em> v. 
Torres</em>, 28 SCRA 489 [1969]).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Another factor which militates against the validity 
</span>of the restraining order issued is the fact that said order was issued 
<span><em>ex-parte</em>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Section 5, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court makes it clear that 
<span>no </span>preliminary injunction <span>may </span>issue 
<span><em>ex-parte</em>, </span>except where the delay made necessary by the 
giving of notice would prevent effective relief and might be productive of 
serious damage (<em>National Mines Allied Workers Union (NAMAWUMIF) v. 
Valero</em>, 132 SCRA 578 [1984]).</p>
<p class="BODY">What the restraining order of respondent Judge enjoins, is the 
fencing of the property by the petitioner, a titled owner, its construction of a 
network of roads, streets and canals thereon <span>or </span>its 
<span>introduction </span>of improvements or exercise of acts of possession.</p>
<p class="BODY">A careful study of the records reveals no case of extreme urgency 
which bears strongly in respondents' favor, much less any impending damage that 
they may suffer because of petitioner's actuations.<span>&nbsp; </span>The area of 
<span>the land </span><span>in </span><span>question </span>as described in the 
complaint is 192 hectares, more or less.<span>&nbsp; </span>The census made by the 
Philippine Constabulary per agreement of April 16, 1971, Annex "E" of the Answer 
<span>found 89 incomplete structures occupying areas of between 2.5 to 10 sq. 
meters scattered in the premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only 71 of the structures were 
claimed by persons appearing in the list.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of the 43 parties to the 
case filed in the court <em>a quo </em>only twenty eight (28) appear in said 
list.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, fifteen (15) of the said parties are not in 
possession of any portion of the land in question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In </span><span>sharp contrast, </span><span>it is admitted 
that petitioner is in possession of the portions not occupied by the 
structures.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's possession is </span><span>of 
</span><span>more than 99% of the land in question (Reply, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 299-300).<span>&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably, 
therefore, it is the petitioner who stands more to suffer from the invasion of 
the land in dispute by speculators, squatters, and other unscrupulous persons 
who were led to believe that the decision of the lower court nullifying 
petitioner's titles is already final (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 
pp. 406-407).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On this issue, the Supreme Court adopted a resolution on 
</span><st1:date month="10" day="12" year="1971"><span>October 12, 
1971</span></st1:date><span>, which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and that it has the right, at least <em>prima facie</em>, to exercise rights of 
ownership and possession over said land:<span>&nbsp; </span>As prayed for, let a writ 
of preliminary injunction issue, upon the filing of a bond in the sum of ten 
thousand pesos (P10,000.00) to be approved by this Court, enjoining respondent 
Judge from enforcing the restraining order issued by him on August 13, 1971 and 
from proceeding in any manner with Civil Case No. 678-M (15043), until further 
orders by this Court." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 418).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Finally, under Section 5, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 224, a judge may 
issue a temporary restraining order with a limited life of twenty (20) days from 
date of issue.<span>&nbsp; </span>If </span>before the expiration of the 20-day 
period the application for preliminary injunction is denied, the temporary 
restraining order would thereby be deemed automatically vacated.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>If no action is taken by the judge on the application <span>for 
preliminary injunction </span>within the said 20-days, the temporary restraining 
order would automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force of law, no 
judicial declaration to that effect being necessary.<span>&nbsp; </span>A temporary 
restraining order can no longer exist indefinitely for it has become truly 
temporary (<em>Board of Transportation v. Castro</em>, 125 SCRA 417 [1983] 
citing <span class="SpellE"><em>Dionisio</em></span><em>, et al. v. Court of First 
Instance of South Cotabato</em>, Branch II, G.R. No. 61048 promulgated on August 
17, 1983).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the same case, the Court ruled that respondent Judge 
committed a grave abuse of discretion in failing to resolve without considerable 
delay petitioner's motion for the dissolution of the restraining order.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner argues further, that a class suit is not proper 
in this case as such presupposes a common and general interest by several 
plaintiffs in a single specific thing (Section 12, Rule 3, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it cannot be 
maintained when each of those <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as alleged 
plaintiffs "has only a special or particular interest in the specific thing 
completely different from another thing in which the defendants have a like 
interest." (<span class="SpellE"><em>Berces</em></span><em> v. Villanueva</em>, 25 
Phil. 473).<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 24).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioner's contention is 
meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is not a case where one or more may sue for the</span> 
<span>benefit of all (<span class="SpellE"><em>Mathay</em></span><em> v. 
Consolidated Bank and Trust Company,</em> 58 SCRA 559) or where the 
representation of class interest affected by the judgment or decree is 
indispensable to make each member of the class an actual party (<span class="SpellE"><em>Borlaza</em></span><em> v. Polistico</em>, 47 Phil. 348; 
<em>Newsweek, Inc. v. The Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.</em>, G.R. No. 
63559, promulgated </span><st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1986"><span>May 30, 
1986</span></st1:date><span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, a class suit would not lie because each of the 
defendants has an interest only in the particular portion of the land he is 
actually occupying, and not in the portions individually occupied by the other 
defendants.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Berces</em></span><em> v. Villanueva, supra</em>; <span class="SpellE"><em>Rallonza</em></span><em> v. Evangelista</em>, 15 Phil. 
531).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>They do not have a common or general interest in the 
subject matter of the controversy (<em>Newsweek, Inc. v. The Intermediate 
Appellate Court, et al., supra</em>).</p>
<p class="BODY">Hence, there is merit in petitioner's contention that only the 
principal plaintiff named in the complaint <span class="SpellE">Inocencio</span> 
Bernardo can remain as party plaintiff, and all the rest must be dropped from 
the case, pursuant to Section 11, Rule 38 of the Rules of Court.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>And since Bernardo does not pretend to own almost two million square 
meters involved in the case, the restraining order of respondent Judge granting 
that it could be maintained must be co-extensive with the boundaries of 
Bernardo's claim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, respondent Judge cannot 
restrain petitioner from performing acts of ownership or dominion over the 
entire 200 hectares involved in this case.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>But more than the foregoing, it will be noted that in 
respondents' complaint, they pray among other things that the Original 
Certificates of Titles in question be declared null and void and the land in 
dispute, except that portion being claimed as their own, be declared as 
properties of the public domain (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 
</span><span>p. </span><span>55).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On this point, the Supreme Court has already ruled that 
</span><span>in </span><span>all actions for the reversion to the Government of 
lands of the public domain or improvements thereon, the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
is the real party in interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>The action shall be instituted by 
the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his stead, in behalf of the 
Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
(<em>Director of Lands v. Lim, et al.</em>, G.R. No. L-4372, </span><st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1952"><span>April 30, 
1952</span></st1:date><span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It will be noted that respondents themselves allege that the 
Director of Lands refused to be a party plaintiff (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 49).<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, as to 
the portion of land being claimed for the government by respondents, the case 
has to be dismissed.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand as to the portions claimed by respondents for 
themselves, it is evident that their action is already barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">In a line of decisions, the Court has uniformly held in favor of 
the registered owner who had been in possession of the property in dispute for a 
considerable period of <span>time, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Having been registered owners of lot for more than 40 years and 
having possessed it during said period, their title had become indefeasible and 
their possession could not be disturbed.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Sinoan</em></span><em> v. Soroñgon</em>, 136 SCRA 
407).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Failure of the deceased or his predecessors-in-interest to take 
steps to assert any rights over the disputed land for 20 years from date of 
registration of title is fatal to their cause of action on the ground of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(133 SCRA 718, 
[1984], <span class="SpellE"><em>Caragay-Layno</em></span><em> v. Court of 
Appeals</em>).</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Cause of action to recover possession of property is barred by 
<span class="SpellE">laches</span> due to petitioner's inaction for more than 50 
years." (<span class="SpellE"><em>Alarcon</em></span><em> v. Bidin</em>, 120 SCRA 
390).</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the other hand, private respondents lay stress on the 
alleged fact that the instant petition of <i><em>certiorari</em></i> is not 
proper as the petitioner is not without any remedy, speedy and adequate in the 
lower court itself.<span>&nbsp; </span>They say petitioner could and should have 
moved for a reconsideration of the restraining order of the lower court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 111).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>This contention is untenable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that a motion for 
new trial or reconsideration is not a prerequisite to an appeal, a petition for 
review or a petition for <i><em>certiorari</em></i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
amendments to the Rules of Court by the Judiciary Reorganization Act, (Batas 
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129) and by 
the <em>interim</em></span> <span>Rules have been held to apply prospectively, 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Habaluyas</em></span><em> Enterprises Inc. v. 
Japson</em>, 142 SCRA 211-212 [1986]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>This case was brought before the Supreme Court for the 
resolution of an incident in Civil Case No. 678-M (15043) and the normal cause 
of action to take thereafter, would be to remand this case to the trial court 
for further proceedings.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, in line with jurisprudence, that 
such time consuming procedure may be properly dispensed with to resolve the 
issue (<span class="SpellE"><em>Quisumbing</em></span><em> v. Court of 
Appeals</em>, L-60364, June 23, 1983, 122 SCRA 709-710) where there is enough 
basis to end the basic controversy between the parties here and now, dispensing 
with procedural steps which would not anyway affect substantially the merits of 
their respective claims (<em>Velasco v. Court of Appeals</em>, </span>L-47544, 
January 28, 1980, 95 SCRA 621-622), We will now resolve this entire 
controversy.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the restraining order issued by
