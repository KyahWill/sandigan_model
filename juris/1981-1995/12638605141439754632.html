<p class="BODY">Since Administrative Case No. 1683 and Administrative Case No.

<p class="BODY">The report of the Solicitor General, dated <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1988</st1:date> in Administrative Case No. 1437
summarized the evidence for the complainant in the following manner:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>EVIDENCE FOR COMPLAINANT</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant <span class="SpellE"><u>Hilaria</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Tanhueco</span></u> testified that she secured the legal services
of respondent to collect indebtedness from her different debtors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although she offered to execute a document
evidencing their lawyer-client relationship, respondent told her that it was
not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She nonetheless offered
to give him 15% of what he may be able to collect from the debtors (pp. 4-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="12">Dec. 3, 1975</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant also declared that respondent borrowed from her
P2,000.00, P1,300.00, and P3,000.00 on three separate occasions, but she could
not remember when she gave those amounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent did not pay those loans (pp. 8-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id</u>.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>She confirmed that respondent filed cases against her debtors and
that one of them, <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>,
paid P12,500.00 to respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Informed
of such payment by <span class="SpellE">Manosca</span> herself, complainant confronted
respondent but the later denied having received payment from any of her
debtors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant then brought the
matter to the attention of <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> which referred
her to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding subsequent demands of
complainant for the money, respondent had refused to give her the amount (pp.
11-15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.).”<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General then summed up the evidence for the
respondent in the following terms:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>EVIDENCE FOR RESPONDENT</u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> G. de <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span></u> testified that complainant indeed secured his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">legal services to collect from her debtors,
with the agreement that he gets 50% of what he may be able to collect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He thus filed collection cases against <span class="SpellE">Tipace</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, <span class="SpellE">Morena</span>. Jr., and others, and was able to obtain favorable
judgment in the cases against <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tipace</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> </span>Mendoza.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The initial payments made by these
judgment-debtors were all given to complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">With respect to <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, respondent obtained a judgment for P19,000.00
although the debt was only P12,000.00 (pp. 3-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">April
 18, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Respondent also declared
that complainant, who was then already old and sickly, was influenced by her
debtors, who were also her friends, into distrusting him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, because complainant filed a
complaint against him with <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> which referred
the matter to </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  12.0pt">Camp</span></st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Crame</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, he terminated his relationship with
complainant and demanded his attorney's fees equivalent to 50% of what he had
collected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant refused to pay
him, hence, he did not also turn over to her the P12,000.00 initial payment of <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, which he considered, or applied, as part payment
of his attorney's fee (pp. 9-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent estimated his attorney's fee due
from complainant in the amount of P17,000.00 (p. 20, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<u>id</u>.)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent denied having borrowed the amounts of P2,000.00,
P1,300.00. P3,000.00 and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P1,000.00, </span>pointing
out that complainant did not even have money to pay him so that he handled the
cases for her on contingent basis (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.)
He also denied having received documentary evidence from complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What evidence he had were all gathered by him
on his initiative (pp. 4-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <u>id</u>.)."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General then set out the following</p>

<blockquote>"<u>F</u> <u>I</u> <u>N</u>
<u>D</u> <u>I</u> <u>N</u> <u>G</u> <u>S</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is in the case at bar <u>clear admissions by both complainant
and respondent of an attorney-client relationship between them</u>,
specifically in the collection of debts owing complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Respondent also admitted, in his answer to
the complaint and in his testimony, having received<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P12,000.00 from judgment-debtor <span class="SpellE">Constancia</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>, without turning over the amount to his<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>client, complainant<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>herein, and applying it instead as part of
his attorney's fees</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been
held that the money collected by a lawyer in pursuance of a judgment in favor
of his client is held in trust (<span class="SpellE">Aya</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Bigonia</span>, 57 Phil., 8; <span class="SpellE">Daroy</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, 65 SCRA 304), and that the attorney should
promptly account for all funds and property received or held by him for the
client's benefit (<span class="SpellE">Daroy</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
<u>supra</u>; In re Bamberger, 49 Phil. 962).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstance that an attorney has a lien for his attorney's fees on
the money in his hands collected for his client does not relieve him from the
obligation to make a prompt accounting (Doming[o] v. Doming[o], G.R. No. 30573,
Oct. 29, 1971; <span class="SpellE">Daroy</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>,
<u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Undoubtedly,
respondent's failure to account for the P12,000.00 representing payment of the
judgment debt of <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span> constitutes unprofessional
conduct</u> and subjects him to disciplinary action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it has likewise been recognized
that a lawyer is as much entitled to judicial protection against injustice,
imposition or fraud on the part of his client; and that the attorney is
entitled to be paid his just fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
attorney should be protected against any attempt on the part of his client to
escape payment of his just compensation (Fernandez v. <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>,
107 Phil. 1140; <span class="SpellE">Albano</span> v. Coloma, G.R. Adm. Case No.
528, Oct. 11, 1967).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This countervailing
rule mitigates the actions of respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As regards the charges that respondent received documents
evidencing the debts to complainant and had refused to return them to the
latter, and that respondent also borrowed some amounts from her, there [is] no
competent, conclusive evidence to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">support
</span>them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perforce, such allegations
have no factual basis." (Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General then recommended that:</p>

<blockquote>"For failure to turn over the amount of P12,000.00 to the
complainant, and applying it as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his
attorney's </span>fees, respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
G. de <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span> be severely reprimanded and admonished
that repetition of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more
severely."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the findings of fact of the Solicitor General supported
by the evidence of record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are,
however, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unable </span>to accept his
recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moneys collected by an attorney on a judgment rendered in favor

(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">When respondent withheld and refused to
deliver the money received by him for his client, the deceased complainant <span class="SpellE">Hilaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanhueco</span>, he breached the
trust reposed upon him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim of the
respondent that complainant had failed to pay his attorney's fees, is not an
excuse for respondent's failure to deliver any amount to the complainant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It is of course true that under Section 37 of Rule 138 of the Revised Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>Court, an attorney has ---</p>

would have to enforce his lien and secure the payment of his just fees and

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The fact that a lawyer has a lien for
fees on moneys in his hands collected for his client, does not relieve him from
his duty promptly to account for the moneys received; his failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to do so </span>constitutes professional

<p class="BODY">In the present case, what respondent could have properly done was
to make an accounting with his client, the complainant, <u>deduct his
attorney's fees due in respect of the amount actually collected by him</u>, and
turn over the remaining balance to the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court notes that the services of
respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">de <span class="SpellE">Dumo</span>
</span>were engaged by the complainant on a number of cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>that these were on differing
stages of completion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was not entitled </span>to hold on to the
entire amount of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">12,000.00 </span>collected

</span>was not enough evidence in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
record </span>to show how <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">much money, <u>if
any</u>, respondent </span>had in fact previously (i.e., other than the
P12,000.00 from <span class="SpellE">Mañosca</span>) collected for and turned
over to complainant (thereby waiving his lien thereon) <u>without</u> deducting
<span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> his claimed contingent fees in respect of

<p class="BODY">The relationship of attorney and client has always been rightly
regarded as one of special trust and confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An attorney must exercise the utmost good
faith and fairness in all his relationships <span class="SpellE"><u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u></span>
his client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent fell far short of
this standard when he failed to render an accounting for the amount actually
received by him and when he refused to turn over any portion of such amount
received by him on behalf of his client upon the pretext that his attorney's
fees had not all been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
had in fact placed his private and personal interest above that of his client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's act constitutes a breach of his
lawyer's oath and a mere reprimand is not an adequate sanction.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is another aspect to this case which the Court cannot gloss
over.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent claimed that he charged
complainant, his client, a contingent fee of fifty percent (50%) of the amount
collected by him, plus interest and whatever attorney's fees may be awarded by
the trial court chargeable to the other party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this jurisdiction, contingent fees are not <u>per</u> <u>se</u>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
But when it is shown that a contract for a contingent fee was obtained by undue
influence exercised by the attorney upon his client or by any fraud or
imposition or that the compensation is clearly excessive, the Court must and
will protect the aggrieved party.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under this scheme, respondent was
actually collecting as attorney's fees sixty percent (60%) or more than half of
the total amount due from defendant debtors; indeed, he was appropriating for
himself more than what he was according to him to turn over to his client.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe and so hold that the contingent fee here claimed was,
under the facts obtaining in this case, grossly excessive and unconscionable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Such a fee structure, when considered in conjunction with the circumstances of

legal fraud and imposition perpetrated upon her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant was an old <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and

was at the time she filed her complaint in 1976, already seventy-six (76) years
old.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her circumstances, and given her
understandable desire to realize upon debts owed to her before death overtook
her, she would easily succumb to the demands of respondent attorney regarding
his attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be stressed
that the mere fact that an agreement had been reached between attorney and
client fixing the amount of the attorney's fees, does not insulate such
agreement from review and modification by the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the same is unreasonable, is now deeply rooted in this jurisdiction to
entertain any serious objection to it</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court has explained:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'But the principle that it may be lawfully stipulated that the
legal expenses involved in the collection of a debt shall be defrayed by the
debtor does not imply that such stipulations must be enforced in accordance
with the terms, no matter how injurious or oppressive they may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawful purpose to be accomplished by such
a stipulation is to permit the creditor to receive the amount due him under his
contract without a deduction of the expenses caused by the delinquency of the
debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be permitted for
him to convert such a stipulation into a source of speculative profit at the
expense of the debtor.</p>

<blockquote>Since then <u>this Court has invariably
fixed counsel fees on a quantum <span class="SpellE">meruit</span> basis whenever
the fees stipulated appear excessive, unconscionable, or unreasonable</u>,
because a lawyer is primarily a court officer charged with the duty of
assisting the court in administering impartial justice between the parties, and
hence, <u>the fees should be subject to judicial control</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor should it be ignored that <u>sound public
policy demands that courts disregard stipulations for counsel fees, whenever

</span>And it is not material that the present action is between attorney and
client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <u>courts have power to fix
the fee as between attorney and client</u>, it must necessarily have the right
to say whether a stipulation like this, inserted in a mortgage contract, is
