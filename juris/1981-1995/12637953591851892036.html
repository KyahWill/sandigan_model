CASURECO II".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the day of the

 13, 1985</st1:date>, an order was issued by the trial court upholding its

motion for reconsideration of said order was filed by defendants but this was
denied in an order of <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 18, 1985, the trial court issued an order resetting the
hearing for preliminary injunction on March 25, 1985 to enable defendants to
elevate the matter to the appellate court and issued the restraining order
enjoining <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> from assuming or otherwise
performing the functions of a member of the Board of Directors of CASURECO II
until further orders of the Court and the respondent CASURECO II to observe and
implement the said restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
with prayer for preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order filed on
March 18, 1985 with this Court wherein petitioners seek to set aside said
orders of March 16 and 18, both of 1985 of the trial court and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>restraining order be issued against
the trial court taking further action on the case until further orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1985, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>supplemental
petition was filed by petitioners informing the Court of the restraining order
the respondent court issued on March 18, 1985 which in effect restrains the
continuance in the performance of the duties of <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span>
as an incumbent member of the Board of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Directors
who was elected in 1981 whose term of office will end on March 30, 1985 and
that assuming that he was not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a

he represents he cannot be arbitrarily suspended or removed from office so that
petitioners pray for a restraining order against the enforcement of said order
and for the respondent Judge from taking further proceedings in the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1985</st1:date>,
without giving due course to the petition the respondents were required to
comment thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The comment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">thereon </span>having been filed by the respondents, on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1985</st1:date> the Court gave due
course to the petition and required the parties to submit their simultaneous
memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only petitioners submitted
their memoranda. The case is now submitted for deliberation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The main thrust of the
petition is that the respondent court has no jurisdiction over the case citing
Section 24 of P.D. 269 as amended, which vests in the National Electrification
Administration (NEA) the power of supervision and control over all electric
cooperatives as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'Section 24.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Board</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Directors</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>(a)
The Management of a Cooperative shall be vested in its Board, subject to the
supervision and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">control</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>of NEA which shall have the right to
be represented and to participate in all Board meetings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">and deliberations and to approve all policies and resolutions.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'The<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>composition,
qualifications, the manner of elections and filling of vacancies, the
procedures for holding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">meetings and
other similar provisions shall be defined in the By-laws of the </span>Cooperative
<u>subject</u> to NEA policies, rules and regulations...' "<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus petitioners argue that:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to the authority granted it by law, the NEA
promulgated a standard Electric Cooperative Election Code which the CASURECO II
Board of Directors adopted under its Board Resolution No. 108, s. 1982, as
amended by Board Resolution No. 84-141 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Election Cooperative Election Code
provides for the creation of a District Election Committee (DEC) which shall,
among other things, 'decide on all election matters including protests,
queries, referrals, postponement and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nullification'
(par. f, Sec. 26, Electric Cooperative Election Code), 'act as Board of
Canvassers' (Sec. 26-g, <u>ibid</u>), and 'proclaim the winning candidate'
(Sec. 50, <u>ibid</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise
vested with the 'sole jurisdiction' over all protests relating to the election
of the members of the Board of Directors, although its decision is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the NEA (<span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 51,
52, <u>ibid</u>).</span><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>As already adverted to above, respondent <span class="SpellE">Abante</span>
filed two formal complaints questioning the residence qualification of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These two complaints were duly heard and resolved by the DEC in its
Resolution No. 04 dated <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">8 </span>February 1985</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Abante</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">did </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not appeal
from this Resolution which upheld the residence qualification of <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.</span><u><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, the District Election Committee which is vested
with authority to decide questions of this nature has already ruled that
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span> possesses the necessary residence
qualification, a decision which has long become <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">final, no </span>appeal having been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question, therefore, of <span class="SpellE">Fortuno's</span> alleged non-residence within the area coverage of
District V had finally been resolved by the duly constituted and authorized
administrative body in accordance with the internal rules and regulations of
both CASURECO II and the National Electric Administration.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, we earnestly underline the fact that immediately after
the elections on the afternoon of <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="2">February
 9, 1985</st1:date>, the DEC proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span> as
the duly elected Director for District V.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No protest against petitioner's proclamation was filed with the DEC,
which has the <u>sole</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> to entertain the same, within the
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> 72-hour period provided for in Section
51 of the Electric Cooperative Election Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, said proclamation may no longer be questioned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These facts assume greater significance when it is remembered that
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Abante</span> himself, in his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Certificate of Candidacy (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
3), expressly agreed to abide by the Electric </span>Cooperative Election Code,
thereby <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">placing himself squarely within
the jurisdiction of the provisions thereof.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We respectfully submit, therefore, that inasmuch as the power to
determine and decide the residence qualification of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span> is vested in, and falls within the peculiar
function and competence of the NEA, acting through its duly created District
Election Committee, that the decision rendered by the latter had already become
final, said resolution may no longer be questioned elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court thus is without
jurisdiction and authority to review and reverse the aforesaid decision of the
District Election Committee."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

of the respondent court it made the following disquisition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

in a petition to the National Electrification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>No protest was filed by <span class="SpellE">Abante</span> within the

in Section 51 of the Electric Cooperative Election Code.<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The elected board of CASURECO II will assume their position for a
term of 3 years on <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abante</span>, convinced
that <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span> is disqualified because of non-residence
in the area, filed this present Special Civil Action for Quo <span class="SpellE">Warranto</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
<span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span> in raising the issue of jurisdiction contends
that judicial intervention is not proper; that petitioner failed to exhaust
administrative remedies; that this Court has no jurisdiction over the nature of
subject matter of the action; that it is the DEC who is vested with the 'sole
jurisdiction over all protests of directors, although its decision is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the NEA'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed that Courts may not intervene in the purely internal
affairs of the cooperative and in this regard, respondent cited the case of the
Lions Club International vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, et al.
(121, SCRA 628) where the Supreme Court opined that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'in accordance with the general rules as to
the judicial interference, the decision of an unincorporated association on the
question of an election to office is a matter peculiarly and exclusively to be
determined by the association and, in the absence of fraud, is final and
binding on the courts'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in the same
case the Supreme Court also said 'The general rule on non-interference in the
internal affairs of associations is, however, subject to exceptions, but the
power of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">review is extremely
limited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the courts <u>have
and will exercise power to interfere in the internal affairs of associations
where law </u></span><u>and justice so require</u>, and the proceedings of the
association are subject to judicial review where there is fraud, oppression or
bad faith, or where the action complained of is capricious, <u>arbitrary</u>,
or unjustly discriminatory (underlining supplied, p. 628, Vol. 121, SCRA).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 4 of the verified petition, last
sentence thereof, alleges 'that the DEC with wanton disregard of the elementary
rules of fair play - - due process - - arbitrarily denied petitioners complaint
for the disqualification of respondent <span class="SpellE">Fortuno</span>.' This
Court finds that hearing of the petition for preliminary injunction would not
constitute undue interference in the internal affairs of the CASURECO II.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent CASURECO II in support of its objection to the grant of
preliminary injunction has cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Silon</span>
vs. Vera (64, Philippine 868) to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> proceedings instituted for
the sole purpose of questioning the legality of the election of the directors
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>corporation
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> preliminary
injunction does not lie to prevent said directors and officers from discharging
their offices and to restore the former directors, and the issuance thereof
constitute an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">excess </span>of
jurisdiction and abuse of discretion.'</p>

<blockquote>The Court has read the case and found that
the facts of the case has no parallel to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine laid down in said case cannot
apply even by analogy to the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The 'Reply to the objection' filed by petitioner's counsel has clearly
pointed out the striking difference between the two cases and the
inapplicability of said case to the case at bar.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The rule regarding exhaustion of administrative remedies is not
absolute except when there is an express legal provision requiring such
administrative step <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as a </span>condition precedent to taking action in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This specially in point taking the fact
raised by the respondent that the position is not a public office which would
be strictly subject to the hierarchy of higher administrative offices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to exhaust administrative remedies
may possibly affect the cause of action but not the jurisdiction of the Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another factor, in this particular case, is
that the petitioner, has no other immediate and adequate remedy than to go to
court in view of the forthcoming assumption of office of the new Board of
Directors which would not afford sufficient time to raise the matter to the
higher NEA authorities in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is to be noted that this case does not involve the validity of
the election proceedings, or the number of votes cast but, simply the question
of whether the respondent is qualified or not under the residence requirement
of the position for which he was a candidate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span>

may, it does not deprive said respondent of the right to avail of the right to

<p class="BODY">The ruling of this Court in <u>Lions</u> <u>Club</u> <u>International</u>
that the "courts will not interfere with the internal affairs of an
