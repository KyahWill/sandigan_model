				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">When Rudy Rivas bade good-bye over the microphone to the guests
who were attending a ceremony during the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">eve of a </span>wedding, little did he know that it was his last adieu.</p>

<p class="BODY">He and his daughter Divina Rivas left the celebration past 10
o'clock in the evening of May 20, 1984.  As they walked along a barrio trail towards home at Buri, Mandaon,
Masbate, Rudy felt he had to answer the call of nature.  While he was relieving himself under a guava
tree near the road, five men <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">armed with
</span>a scythe and bolos stabbed him in different portions of his body which
caused immediate death (TSN, August 9, 1985, pp. 11-12; p. 10, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">This incident was supposedly witnessed by the victim's daughter
from a distance of five meters who thereafter ran to report what she saw to her
uncle who was still attending the ceremony (TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 13; TSN,
October 9, 1985, p. 4).  Divina and her
uncle returned to the scene of the incident and found the victim already dead.  Dulcesima Rivas, the wife of Rudy, was
informed of the crime by her daughter that same night and she also went to the
place where her husband was slain.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of these gory details led to the apprehension and prosecution
of Armando Maestro, Lantoy Real and Deony Ruado for the crime of murder
qualified by <u>alevosia</u>.  Nestor
Real and Quidong Ruga, who were also implicated, remained at large (p. 216,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the prosecution, Divina narrated on the witness
stand that her father was attacked by Armando Maestro who inflicted the first
stab wound, followed by Lantoy Real, Nestor Real, Deony Ruado, and Quidong Ruga
(TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 4).  On Deony
Ruado's ill-motive, she claimed that she heard him say during the ceremony:
"You are still announcing by and by you will fall down" while her
father was speaking over the microphone (TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 3).  The wife of the victim also testified that
she was informed by her daughter of the identities of the assailants during the
same night her husband was killed (TSN, January 23, 1985, p. 11).  She also adduced proof to demonstrate that
Armando Maestro and the other malefactors have a collective axe to grind
against her husband in view of the victim's previous testimony as a witness
which implicated the assailants in a case involving theft of a carabao (TSN,
January 23, 1985, p. 13).  Other
incidents which she tried to recall to show that there had been occasions in
the past when Armando Maestro threatened to kill her husband were impressed
upon the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>(TSN, January 23, 1985, pp. 5-10; p.
12, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense offered alibi and denial for
exculpation.  It was at Balud Sea where
Deony Ruado claimed that he was fishing from 7 o'clock in the evening of May
20, 1984 until the wee hours of the morning.  He stressed further that he and his companions thereafter went to
Kulasi, Roxas City where he stayed for two months until he was apprehended
thereat by the police authorities (TSN, August 12, 1985, pp. 1-5).  Herein appellant Lantoy Real asserted that
he, too, was fishing with some of his companions (TSN, August 22, 1985, p. 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court pronounced a verdict of conviction against
Armando Maestro on July 15, 1985 for the crime of murder (p. 139, Record; TSN,
August 9, 1985, p. 5).  Four months
later, Lantoy Real and Deony Ruado were also adjudged guilty of the crime as
charged, but Deony Ruado escaped and has remained at large even before the
judgment against him was promulgated (pp. 61 &amp; 73, Rollo).  Together with Armando Maestro, Lantoy Real,
and Deony Ruado were sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
and were ordered to proportionately pay the sum of P30,000.00 to the heirs of
Rudy Rivas as moral damages, the amount of P30,000.00 as indemnity, plus the
costs of suit (p. 6, Decision; p. 221, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">In thus adjudging these persons accountable for the killing, the
trial court observed that the defense of denial and alibi cannot overcome the
People's evidence showing their participation derived from the positive
testimony of Divina Rivas as an eyewitness to the commission of the
felony.  The daughter of the victim,
said the lower court, could not have been mistaken in pointing the accusing
finger against the perpetrators whom she recognized with ease due to past
acquaintance with them (TSN, August 9, 1985, pp. 14-15, TSN, October 9, 1985,
p. 7).  Alibi, as emphasized below,
could barely produce the desired result as expected by the defense inasmuch as
the distance between the <u>situs</u> of the felony at Barangay Buri, Mandaon
and Balud Sea where they were supposedly fishing can be negotiated by pumpboat
within a span of thirty minutes (TSN, October 12, 1985, p. 2).  In short, the trial judge formulated the
conclusion that:</p>

<blockquote>... The evidence does not show that it was physically impossible
for the accused to be at the place of incident on the fatal evening.  For alibi to prosper, it is not enough to
prove that the accused were somewhere else when the crime was committed but it
must likewise be demonstrated that it was physically impossible for them to
have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">been at the scene of said crime at
the time of its commission (People vs. Dueno, 90 SCRA 23; People vs. Cortes, 57
SCRA 3080).  (p. 5, Decision; p. 220,
Record)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In </span>the appeal
before us, appellant Lantoy Real tries to impeach the credibility of Divina
Rivas by contending that the latter could not have actually witnessed the
killing.  In support thereof he relies
on the testimony of Felix Ruga and Barangay Captain Apolonio Ruado who declared
that Ruga was told by the victim that he will leave his daughter behind at the
ceremony and that he will go home ahead.  Lantoy Real thereby concludes that Divina could not have been with her
father when he was killed later (p.12, Brief for Accused-Appellant, p. 82,
Rollo).  Further, the defense introduced
the Barangay Captain whose story is to the effect that it was he, on the
morning following the slaying, who informed the wife of the victim <u>and</u>
Divina of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">These narrations do not necessarily suggest the idea regarding
the alleged absence of Divina at the <u>locus</u> <u>criminis</u>.  Busy as Felix Ruga was in attending to the
guests, he could not have known, much less, monitored if <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Divina </span>did not accompany her father <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">home.  Verily, Felix Ruga was not sure of himself as to </span>when Divina
actually left the party:</p>

you please reconcile that statement of yours when you said that somebody

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
was no longer there.  (Tsn, February 28,
1985, p. 7).  (pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">11-12, Appellee's Brief, p. 164, Rollo)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the barangay captain's statement that it was he who
informed the wife and daughter of the victim about the killing, this, too, does
not convey the impression that Divina did not accompany her father on the way
home.  The premise was established in
the course of Divina's cross-examination on January 17, 1985 that after she
informed her uncle and mother about the killing, Divina and her mother spent
the night together (TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 15).  It was but natural for the barangay captain to claim that he
informed the wife of the victim <u>and</u> Divina about Rudy's killing the
following day (TSN, March 1, 1985, pp. 2?3), for mother and daughter were
then together.  Therefore, it is
erroneous to say that Divina did not witness the killing of her father simply
because Divina was with her mother the following morning when the barangay
captain went to their house conveying the sad message of the killing of Rudy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues next that even assuming Divina was present when
her father was mercilessly ganged upon, she could not have witnessed the actual
killing because it was dark since the moon appeared from the horizon only at
around 10:53 in the evening or a few <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">minutes
later.  In </span>addition, appellant
avers that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">victim </span>had to
conceal himself so as to move his bowels, thereby insinuating that Divina's
view could have been obstructed when the killing took place.  Even if the moon had not yet risen from the
horizon, it was not totally impossible for Divina to see the assault from a
distance of five meters (TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 4).  Too, Divina and her father had travelled
some distance before the attack so that Divina's eyes had already adjusted to
the unlighted barrio trail.  Neither is
it correct for appellant to assume that Rudy concealed himself before relieving
himself because there was no proof to indicate that there were shrubs or other
obstructions nearby which he could have utilized as cover.</p>

<p class="BODY">About two and half hours by pumpboat from Lantoy Real's residence
at Barangay Bugnay, Mandaon to where the crime was perpetrated does not
demonstrate such physical nor actual insurmountable barrier as to preclude his
presence at the place of the crime, especially so when appellant frankly stated
that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>out at the sea
around 4 o'clock in the afternoon of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">May
20, </span>1984 whereas Rudy's death occurred at around 10 o'clock that evening
(TSN, August 22, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1985, p. 5).  Indeed, alibi as a form of excuse is </span>inherently
weak if it is established mainly by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">accused
</span>himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(<u>People</u> </span><u>vs</u>.
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Solis</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>195 SCRA 405 [1991]) and principally
due to its easy fabrication (<u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Bugho</u>, 202 SCRA
164 [1991]).  Moreover, alibi cannot
prevail over the positive identification of a credible witness of the People,
like Divina Rivas who testified in a straightforward manner with respect to the
presence and participation of the malefactors at the scene of the felony at the
time of the commission thereof (TSN, January 17, 1985, p. 4; <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Plaga</u>, 202 SCRA 53 [1991]; <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Montanilla</u>,
211 SCRA 119 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the aspect of treachery alleged in the information as a
circumstance to qualify the crime to murder, it has been held, and the trial
court correctly observed, that <u>alevosia</u> is present if the victim was
attacked without any opportunity on his part to repel the aggression or escape
like when he is answering a call of nature <u>(People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Gerardo</u>,
91 Phil 395 [1952]; <u>Gregorio</u>, Fundamentals of Criminal Law Review, Eight
Ed., 1988, p. 127), more so when he was stabbed by several persons (<u>People</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Lopez</u>, 132 SCRA 188 [1984]; <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Surban</u>,
123 SCRA 218 [1983]; <u>Gregorio</u>, <u>supra</u>, at p. 129).  Indeed, there was here the employment of
means or manner of execution which insured the attackers’ safety from any
defensive or retaliatory act on the part of the victim (<u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Toribio</u>, 198 SCRA 529 [1991]).  The trial court properly noted that nighttime cannot be considered
separate from, as it is deemed absorbed by, <u>alevosia</u>  (<u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Necerio</u>,
211 SCRA 415 [1992]) in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">absence of
proof that nighttime was specifically sought in the commission thereof (<u>People</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Pinto</u>, <u>Jr</u>., 204 SCRA 9 [1991]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Murder is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">punishable by <u>reclusion</u>
<u>temporal</u> in its maximum</span> period to death under Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code.  In default of any
mitigating <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or aggravating circumstance
that attended the offense </span>which would have either reduced or increased
the penalty, the trial court properly imposed the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>
(<u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Deslate</u>, 192 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
