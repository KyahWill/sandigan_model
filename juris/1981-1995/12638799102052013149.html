comply with the express directives of the second Memorandum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was therefore considered to be on absence
without official leave (AWOL).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This

<p class="BODY">It was upon his return to the country sometime in May 1987 that

his application for vacation leave had been approved by his immediate chief and

the confidential report he had addressed to the Deputy Executive Secretary,
petitioner explained:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed a petition for review with prayer for
reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> before respondent Civil
Service Commission ("Commission"), which the Commission denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission held that the grant of
petitioner's application for vacation leave, notwithstanding the accumulation
of sufficient leave credits, was discretionary on the part of respondent <span class="SpellE">Rabina</span>, the approving official, citing <u>In re: <span class="SpellE">Nicolasura</span>, Victor</u> (CSC Res. No. 88-251) dated 25 May

<p class="BODY">Having failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">g</span>et
reconsideration, petitioner came to this Court on the present Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner challenges his dismissal as bein<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">g</span> arbitrary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The propriety of petitioner's alleged
unlawful removal boils down to the question of whether or not an employee
holding a position considered as "primarily confidential" may be
dismissed on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">g</span>rounds of
"loss of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">c</span>onfidence"
by the appointing authority on the basis of the employee's having gone on
unauthorized leave of absence and of his having filed a confidential report on
one of his superiors directly with the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">We begin with the proposition that the effects of characterizing
a position as "primarily confidential" are two-fold:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>firstly, such characterization renders
inapplicable the ordinary requirement of filling up a position in the Civil
Service on<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>the basis of merit
and fitness as determined by competitive examinations; and secondly, while the
1987 Constitution does not exem<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">p</span>t
such positions from the operation of the principle set out in Article IX (B),
Section 2 (3) of the same Constitution that "no officer or employee of the
Civil Service shall be removed or suspended except for cause provided by
law," the "cause provided by law" includes "loss of
confidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is said to be a settled rule that those holding primarily confidential
positions "continue for so long as confidence in them endures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their termination can be justified on the
ground of loss of confidence because in that case their cessation from office
involves no <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">removal</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>but the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">expiration</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>of
their term of office."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Notwithstanding the refined distinction between removal from office and
expiration of the term of a public officer, the net result is loss of tenure
upon loss of confidence on the part of the appointing power.</p>

<p class="BODY">A position in the Civil Service may be considered primarily
confidential:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) when the President of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
upon recommendation of the Civil Service Commission, has declared that position
to be primarily confidential; or (2) when the position, given the character of

positions involve the highest degree of confidence, or are closely bound up
with and dependent on other positions to which they are subordinate, or are
temporary in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may truly be

this category be terminable at the will of the officer that makes them.</blockquote>

It is also instructive to refer to some of the positions which the Court has
refused to designate as "primarily confidential:" e. g., members of
the Customs Police Force or Port Patrol;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that the duties of petitioner related to the study
and analysis of organizational structures and procedures, with the end in view
of making recommendations designed to increase the levels of efficiency and
coordina­tion within the organization so analyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the modest rank and fungible nature
of the position occupied by petitioner, is underscored by the fact that the
salary attached to it was no more than P1,500.00 a month at the time he went on
leave (October, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There thus appears
nothing to suggest that petitioner's position was "highly" or even
"primarily confidential" in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that petitioner may, sometimes, handle "confidential
matters" or papers which are confidential in nature, does not suffice to
characterize their <u>positions</u> as <u>primarily</u> confidential.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, we believe and so hold that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tria's</span> particular position of "Management and Audit
Analyst I" is not a "primarily confidential" position so as to
render him removable upon, or the expiration of his term of office concurrent
with, "loss of confidence" on the part of the appointing power who,
as already noted, was the then Commissioner of the FMIB.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If petitioner <span class="SpellE">Tria</span> was not legally
removable upon "loss of confidence" on the part of the FMIB
Commissioner, was there nonetheless legal cause provided by law for his
dismissal from the service?</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the constitutional prohibition against suspension
or dismissal of an officer or employee of the Civil Service "except for
cause provided by law" is a guaranty of both procedural and substantive
due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Procedural due process
requires that suspension or dismissal come as a general rule, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only </span>after notice and hearing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, as already noted, the EIIB issued a Memorandum to
petitioner, after he was already in Manila, requiring him to explain why no
disciplinary action should be taken against him for having submitted a report
directly to the Office of the President, <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>,
"which adversely affected the bureau's image and placed the Commissioner
in an embarrassing position," which Memorandum was not received by
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after his return
from abroad and upon request of petitioner, another investigation was conducted
by the EIIB where petitioner had an opportunity to explain his side of the
matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court considers that, under
the circumstances of this case, the subsequent investigation constituted
substantial compliance with the demands of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Substantive due process requires, among other things, that an officer
or employee of the Civil Service be suspended or dismissed only "for
cause," a phrase which, so far as concerns dismissals of public officers <u>not</u>
holding positions which are "policy determining, highly technical or
primarily confidential," has acquired, according to this Court, the
following "well-defined concept:"</p>

<blockquote>"It means for reasons which the law and sound policy recognize
as sufficient warrant for removal, that is, <u>legal cause, and not merely
causes which the appointing power in the exercise of discretion may deem
sufficient</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is implied that <u>officers
may not be removed at the mere will of those vested with the power of removal,
or without cause</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, <u>the
cause must relate to and affect the administration of the office</u>, and must
be restricted to <u>something of a substantial nature directly affecting the
rights and interests of the public</u>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, we have noted earlier that petitioner was
charged with violation of official rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and
</span>regulations consisting, more specifically, of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) having gone on an extended unauthorized
leave of absence; (2) having bypassed official channels in transmitting a
report concerning alleged misfeasance or non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span>
on the part of a superior officer of the EIIB directly to the Office of the President
through the Deputy Executive Secretary, rather than through the respondent EIIB
Commissioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that petitioner was probably precipitate in taking off
for abroad before his application for vacation leave was formally approved by
the FMIB Central Office <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We must, however, take into account the
circumstance that his application for leave without pay had been approved or
indorsed for approval by his immediate superior in the FMIB, Region 5 Office,
where petitioner was assigned, and so petitioner was not completely without
basis in believing that the formal approval of his application in the FMIB
Central Office would follow <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>a
matter of course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is pertinent to
point out that his immediate superiors in the Region 5, FMIB Office were the
persons in the best position to ascertain whether his presence in the Regional
office during the period covered by his application for leave without pay was
really demanded by imperious exigencies of the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record is bare of any indication what
those exigencies were, at that particular time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is also no showing that the FMIB actually suffered any prejudice
by reason of the non-availability of the services of petitioner during his
leave without pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was, it
should be recalled, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>"Management
and Audit Analyst I," a humble rank separated by many ranks from the
appointing power, the FMIB Commissioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It thus <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">appears to the Court
that, on balance, the extreme penalty of dismissal from the service was unduly
harsh in the case of petitioner; that suspension for thirty (30) days would
have been more than adequate punishment for precipitately going on leave
without pay prior to formal approval of his leave by the Central Office of the
FMIB; and that the real and efficient cause of his dismissal from the service
was the fact that he had bypassed official channels in rendering the
confidential report addressed to the Deputy Executive Secretary, Office of the
President, concerning the then Regional Director of FMIB, Region 5.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After careful consideration, we believe and so hold that, in the
circumstances of this case, that act of petitioner did not constitute lawful
cause for his dismissal from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We believe, on the contrary, that petitioner's case is covered by the
rule in <u>Gray v. De Vera</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">On the following day, the PHHC Board of
Directors terminated Gray's services "on account of loss of confidence due

this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The removal</u> of Board Secretary Gray from the primarily

the most serious of which was that the Directors were grabbing as ‘quotas
dwelling awards despite applicants of long standing,’ was <u>an act of civic

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, we note that petitioner sent his confidential
(and presumably sealed) report to an office having overall administrative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supervision </span>and control over the FMIB
(i.e., the Office of the President); the report was not, in other words, sent
either to the media <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>to an
office or agency having no administrative jurisdiction over the public official
or office complained of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That report was
a privileged communication and the author thereof enjoys the benefit of the
presumption that he acted in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents have not alleged that petitioner acted with malice in
fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not believe that
petitioner's act constituted serious misconduct but rather, on the contrary,
was an act of personal and civic courage by which petitioner exhibited his
loyalty to the FMIB <u>as an institution</u> and ultimately to the Government
of the Republic of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considerations of fundamental public policy thus compel us to hold
that petitioner was dismissed without lawful cause and must, therefore, be
reinstated to the position he previously held or, if that position is no longer
available, to some other position in the EIIB of equivalent rank and
emoluments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, petitioner is
entitled to payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> (basic salary
