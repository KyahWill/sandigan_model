<p class="BODY">The relevant facts of the case, as disclosed by the record, are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1979, private respondents, by themselves and
through their predecessors-in-interest, filed complaints docketed as Civil
Cases No. 630 and No. 631 of the Municipal Trial Court of Taytay, Rizal, for
recovery of portions of a parcel of land located at Sitio Sampalucan, Barangay
San Isidro, Taytay, Rizal, against David Palmenco, Chayong Rabino, Felix
Magpili, Fisco Obrero, Herminio Simon, Oscar Santos, Gerry Degra, Tino Balinas,

(hereinafter referred to as David Palmenco, et al.).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, although occupants of portions of the subject parcel
of land in Civil Cases No. 630 and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">No. </span>631,
were not impleaded as defendants in said cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 29, 1983, the Municipal Trial Court rendered a joint
decision in the afore-mentioned cases,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>the
dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, decision is hereby rendered in the above-entitled cases
sentencing the defendants David Palmenco, Chayong Rabino, Felix Magpili, Fisco
Obrero, Herminio Simon, Oscar Santos, Gerry Degra, Tino Balinas, Terio Salinas,
Alicia Baltazar, Remy Rosario, Diony del Rosario, Arturo del<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Rosario, Hipolito Rosal, Oscar

Nestor Subia, Manuel Carlos, Cornelio Depano, Rufino Santos, and Jose Libaguin,
all of them, to vacate the premises in question and to restore the possession
thereof of the plaintiffs; to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P6,000.00 as
attorney's fees and the costs of the suit.  (p. 73, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1985, upon motion by private respondents, the
Municipal Trial Court of Taytay, Rizal, issued a writ of execution directing
the defendants in said cases to vacate subject parcel of land.  Said defendants resisted the enforcement of
the writ of execution on the ground that they had filed with the Bureau of
Lands a complaint, docketed as B.L. Claim No. 625, against private respondents,
and that the Director of Lands in said B.L. Claim No. 625 rendered a decision
on September 18, 1986, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>. . . Accordingly, they shall, upon subdivision survey and approval
thereof at their own expense, file within sixty (60) days from such approval
appropriate public land application[s], otherwise, they shall lose the right of
preference.  Likewise, the claim of
claimants-respondents to the areas occupied by them is sustained and they are
hereby allowed to file within the same period after approval of the subdivision
survey appropriate public land [applications] failure of which they shall lose
their right of preference.  (p. 74,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To abate the execution, defendants David Palmenco, et al., filed
a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and injunction, docketed as
AC-G.R. SP No. 05934 of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals)
praying, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, that the decision rendered and the writ of
execution issued in Civil Cases No. 630 and No. 631 be annulled and set
aside.  On April 26, 1985, respondent
court dismissed the petition (Annex D, Memorandum of Private Respondents, p.
121, Rollo).  The decision in SP No.
05934 having become final, the Municipal Trial Court issued on September 18,
1985 an order for the issuance of an alias writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">3, </span>1985,
David Palmenco, et al., the defendants in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631, filed
another petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and injunction with the
Regional Trial Court, Antipolo, Rizal, docketed as Civil Case No. 729-A,
seeking to annul among others, said order of September 18, 1985 authorizing the
issuance of a writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 11, 1985, the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo,
Rizal, rendered a decision in Case No. 729-A denying and dismissing the
petition (See Decision of Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08124, p. 122,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, said
defendants filed another petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and
injunction, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 08124 of respondent Court of Appeals,
praying (a) to set aside the decision dated November 11, 1985 in Civil Case No.
729-A, (b) to set aside the alias writ of execution issued by the Municipal
Trial Court in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631, the levy on execution dated
November 22, 1985 and the Certificate of Sale both issued by the Deputy
Regional Sheriff in said Civil Cases No. 630 and 631, and (c) to enjoin the
Municipal Judge from issuing an alias writ of execution and a writ of
demolition (See Decision of Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 08124,
supra).  It is to be noted that this is
the second time that this case was brought to the Court of Appeals.  The first one was SP No. 05934,
aforementioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 24, 1986, the Court of Appeals promulgated its
decision in SP No. 08124 dismissing the petition (Annex E of Memorandum for
Private Respondents, pp. 122-128, Rollo).  A motion for reconsideration was filed by petitioners therein but on
December 15, 1988, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution denying the motion
for reconsideration (Annex F, Memorandum for Private Respondents, pp. 130-133,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed in Civil Cases No. 630 and No. 631 an
opposition dated November 27, 1986 (pp. 134-136, Rollo of CA-G.R. SP No.
16527), to the issuance of a writ of demolition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 1, 1988, the other occupants of the subject parcel of
land in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631, petitioners herein, filed an action for
damages, docketed as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Civil </span>Case
No. 1243 of the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal, against respondents
(1) Marina Cruz and (2) Antonio Cruz and (3) Eduardo Cruz, (4) Concepcion Cruz,
(5) Teresita Cruz, (6) Mario Jose, (7) Mariano Gongora, (8) Hector Jose, (9)
Juan S.P. Herros and (10) Pio E. Martinez, in his capacity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional
Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal (See Decision of Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP
No. 16527, p. 33, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 1, 1988, petitioners filed another action docketed as
Civil Case No. 1311-A with the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal, for
annulment of the writ of demolition with damages against private respondents
(1) Adora Cruz, (2) Antonio Cruz, and (3) Ruben Gongora, and (4) Eduardo Cruz,
(5) Concepcion Cruz, (6) Teresita Cruz, (7) Mario Jose, (8) Mariano Gongora,
(9) Hector Jose, (10) Pio Martinez, (11) Juan S.P. Herras; and (12) the
Honorable Dominador Domingo (Petition, p. 9, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, David Palmenco, et al., the defendants in Civil
Cases No. 630 and 631 filed an action for injunction with damages docketed as
Civil Case No. 1312-A of the same Regional Trial Court, against private
respondents (1) Adora Cruz, (2) Antonio Cruz, and (3) Ruben Gongora, and (4)
Eduardo Cruz, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(5) </span>Concepcion
Cruz, (6) Teresita Cruz, (7) Mario Jose, (8) Mariano Gongora, (9) Hector Jose,

Domingo (See Decision of Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 16527, p. 33,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On Dec<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">e</span>mber 6,
1988, the trial court in Civil Case No. 1311-A issued a restraining order
directing herein private respondents and the other defendants in said case to
refrain from implementing the alias writ of demolition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents Adora Cruz, et al. filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with the Court of Appeals docketed therein as CA-G.R. SP No.
16527, praying that the order dated December 6, 1988 issued in Civil Case No.
1311-A be annulled and that the Honorable Patricio Patajo, the Presiding Judge
of the Regional Trial Court of Antipolo, Rizal, be prohibited from conducting
further proceedings in Civil Cases No. 1243 and No. 1311.  This was the third time the case was brought
before the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 30, 1990, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision in
SP No. 16527 declaring the order dated December 6, 1988 null and void.  On September 25, 1990, the Court of Appeals
denied herein petitioners' motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition upon the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case of Suson vs.
Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appeals, </span>172 SCRA 70,
75, does not apply in this case.  (p.
11, Rollo)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are lawful
occupants of the portions of the parcel of land decreed by the Bureau of Lands
as alienable public domain. They cannot be deprived of their possessory rights
without due process of law.  (p. 14,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondents' cause of
action in the ejectment cases is anchored on ownership of said parcel of
land.  Now that the Bureau of Lands has
decreed said parcel of land as alienable public in nature, respondents are not
entitled to the relief of possession.  (p. 15, Rollo)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The alias writ of demolition
has varied the terms of the decision in the ejectment cases and is, therefore,
null and void.  (p. 16, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The grounds propounded by petitioners may be condensed to one
issue, namely, whether the writ of execution issued in Civil Cases No. 630 and
No. 631 may be enforced against petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be stressed that petitioners have not been impleaded as
party defendants in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631 although they are occupying
portions of the parcel of land, subject-matter of said cases.  The rule is that a judgment can not bind
persons who are not parties to the action (<u>Vda.</u> <u>de</u> <u>Sengbengco</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Arellano</u>, 1 SCRA 711 [1961]; <u>Hollero</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 11 SCRA 310 [1964]; <u>Plata</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Yatco</u>,
12 SCRA 718 [1964]).  This rule is
anchored on the constitutional right of a person to due process of law.  No person shall be condemned or judgment
rendered against him without due process of law.  Thus, this Court in <u>Macabingkil</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Yatco</u>,
21 SCRA 150 [1967]) held:</p>

<blockquote>As far back as 1908, U.S. v. Ling Su Fan, this Court affixed the
imprimatur of its approval on Webster's definition of procedural due
process.  Thus:  "By the law of the land is more clearly
intended the general law, a law which hears before it condemns, which proceeds
upon inquiry and renders judgment only after trial." This court in a 1924
decision, Lopez v. Director of Lands, after quoting the above added that due
process "contemplates notice and opportunity to be heard before judgment
is rendered, affecting one's person or property." It is satisfied
according to another leading decision:  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">"If </span>the following conditions are
present, namely:  (1) There must be a
court or tribunal clothed with judical power to hear and determine the matter
before it; (2) jurisdiction must be lawfully acquired over the person of the
defendant or over the property which is the subject of the proceeding; (3) the
defendant must be given an opportunity to be heard; and (4) judgment must be
rendered upon lawful hearing." (at p. 157.)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that petitioners were denied due process of law.  They are possessors of portions of the
parcel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>land in question yet
they were not impleaded as defendants in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631 for which
reason any judgment rendered in said cases and any order or writ issued therein
cannot be enforced against them.</p>

<blockquote>It must be noted that respondent was not a party to any of the 12
ejectment cases wherein the writs of demolition had been issued; she did not
make her appearance in and during the pendency of these ejectment cases.  Respondent only went to court to protect her
property from demolition after the judgment in the ejectment cases had become
final and executory.  Hence, with
respect to the judgment in said ejectment cases, respondent remains a third
person to such judgment, which does not bind her; nor can its writ of execution
be enforced against her since she was not afforded her day in court in said
ejectment cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The vital legal point here is that respondent did not derive her
right or interest from the defendants-tenants nor from the plaintiff-landlord
(the herein petitioner) but from the Bureau of Lands from which she had leased
the property.  She is neither a party
nor successor in interest to any of the litigants in the ejectment cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We also find no merit in the contention of the petitioner that
respondent having been duly heard by the Court, she was not deprived of her day
in court and was accorded the due process of law. </blockquote>

<blockquote>It cannot be said that the constitutional requirements of due
process were sufficiently complied with because the respondent had been duly
heard.  Indeed, respondent was heard but
simply hearing her did not fulfill the basic conditions of procedural due
process in courts.  When respondent
appeared before the court to protect and preserve her property, the Court had
not lawfully acquired jurisdiction over the property of the respondent because
the premises of the respondent was not included in the ejectment cases and the
judgment in said cases could not affect her property, much less demolish the
same.  In the leading case of El
Banco-Espanol-Filipino v. Palanca cited in Macabingkil v. Yatco, et al., We
laid down the court's constitutional requirements of due process, thus -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"As applied to judicial proceedings. . . it may be laid down
with certainty that the requirements of due process [are] satisfied if the
following conditions are present namely:  (1) There must be a court or tribunal clothed with judicial power to
hear and determine the matter before it; (2) jurisdiction must be lawfully
acquired over the person of the defendant or over the property which is the
subject of the proceedings; (3) the defendant must be given an opportunity to
be heard; and (4) judgment must be rendered upon lawful hearing."</p>

<blockquote>Respondent pursued various steps to protect her property from the
invasion and encroachment of the petitioner, abetted by her counsel and the
deputy sheriff.  She filed a motion for
contempt; she protested to the Sheriff of Manila; she appealed to the Director
of the Bureau of Lands; she filed an urgent motion to suspend the writ of
demolition.  Although the motions for
contempt and for suspension were heard by the court, such actions taken after
the judgment had become final and executory did not make the respondent a party
litigant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the ejectment
cases.  The respondent remained a
stranger to the case and she cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be </span>bound
by the judgment rendered therein, nor by the writs of execution and demolition
issued in pursuance to said judgment.  Intervening as a prejudiced owner of improvements being wrongly
demolished merely to oppose such order of demolition, upon learning that the said
order was directed against premises not her own, is not the same as being a
party to the suit to the extent of being bound by the judgment in the case
where such order of demolition was issued.  Furthermore, it must be noted that said petitions were filed after the
promulgation of the decision in the ejectment cases and while in the process of
execution.  It is not proper to speak of
an intervention in a case already terminated by final judgment.  (<u>Lorenzana</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Cayetano</u>,
78 SCRA 485, [1977] at pp. 490­-492).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional requirements of due process as set forth in
the leading case of <u>El</u> <u>Banco-Espanol-Filipino</u>, <u>v.</u> <u>Palanca</u>,
(37 Phil. 934 [1918]), reiterated in <u>Macabingkil</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Yatco</u>,
<u>supra</u>, and again in <u>Lorenzana</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Cayetano</u>, <u>supra</u>,
are for convenience once more quoted:</p>

<blockquote>As applied to judicial proceedings ... it may be laid down with
certainty that the requirements of due process [are] satisfied if the following
conditions are present namely:  (1)
There must be a court or tribunal clothed with judicial power to hear and determine
the matter before it; (2) jurisdiction must be lawfully acquired over the
person of the defendant or over the property which is the subject of the
proceedings; (3) the defendant must be given an opportunity to be heard; and
(4) judgment must be rendered upon lawful hearing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the second requirement afore-mentioned does not obtain
in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631, for the trial court in said cases did not
acquire jurisdiction over the persons of petitioners as they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span>not impleaded therein and were
consequently not summoned to appear and present their defenses to resist the
claims of private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that petitioners filed, as afore-mentioned, an
opposition to the issuance of a writ of demolition in Civil Cases No. 630 and
No. 631 does not signify that they had voluntarily submitted themselves to the
jurisdiction of the trial court, precisely because the very purpose of said
opposition is that no writ of demolition should be issued or enforced against
them as they are not parties to said case.  Furthermore, it cannot be said that they had intervened in said cases by
the filing of the afore-mentioned opposition for the reason that there can be
no intervention in a case already terminated by final judgment (<u>Lorenzana</u>
<u>vs.</u> <u>Cayetano</u>, <u>supra</u>, p. 492).</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to due process is one of the building blocks of the
edifice of our democratic form of government, and courts must ever be vigilant
in safeguarding it, otherwise persons might be dragooned to jail without so
much as the filing of a complaint, or they may one morning wake up with all
their hard-earned property suddenly gone without so much they being aware of
the cause therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.  The assailed decision dated August 30, 1990
of respondent Court of Appeals is hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE and the writs
of execution and demolition in Civil Cases No. 630 and 631 are hereby declared
null and void and unenforceable in so far as petitioners are concerned.</p>
