				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Judge Mariano C. Tupas of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 4 of Panabo,
Davao, filed with the Court a sworn complaint, dated 4 January 1988, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">against respondent Leo R. </span>Caballero,
who was then <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Interpreter and
Officer-in-Charge of </span>the Office of the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial

<p class="BODY">By a Resolution, dated 9 March 1988, respondent was placed under
preventive suspension and was required to file an Answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Caballero filed his Answer, dated 14 April 1988.  There he claimed that the present complaint
was merely a counter-charge to the administrative case docketed as Adm. Case
No. RTJ-87-141, previously filed on 1 December 1987 by the Association of Court
Employees of Panabo, Davao, of which respondent was a member, against
complainant Judge Tupas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) additional complaints against respondent Caballero were
later filed by Judge Tupas, the first dated 27 March 1990 and the second dated
16 June 1990.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution of the Court dated 29 August 1990, the case was
referred to Executive Judge Marcial L. Fernandez of the Regional Trial Court of
Davao Del Norte for investiga­tion, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">A hearing was set by the Investigating Judge for 11 October 1990,
and notice to respondent was sent through the Station Commanders of Pantukan,
Davao and of Panabo, Davao Integrated National Police.  The station Commander of Pantukan sent a
reply stating that respondent had not been contacted as he was then “operating
a tunnel at Magasecareg, Mabini, Davao." A follow-up notice, dated 9
October 1990, was then sent to the INP Station Commander of Mabini, Davao who
sent a reply on the same day that, according to a Barangay Councilor from
Anitapan, Mabini, Davao, respondent was not known in the said place.  Despite respondent's absence, the hearing
proceeded as scheduled "without prejudice of (sic) cross-examination, and
further disposition by the Supreme Court."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">informed the Investigating Judge that </span>respondent

Magasecareg, Mabini, Davao."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The report of Executive Judge Marcial L. Fernandez, dated 19
October 1990, found respondent guilty of:  (1) malversation and misappropriation of money consigned with the court;
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(2) irregularities in the performance
of duties; </span>(3) gambling and willful non-p<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

respondent be dismissed from the service with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

in </span>the government and forfeiture <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of

<p class="BODY">The Court believes that, in accordance with the requirements of
procedural due process, the additional complaint, dated 27 March 1990, and the
second additional complaint, dated 16 July 1990, should be disregarded in the
process of reaching a decision in this case.  There is nothing in the records to show that a copy of the first
additional complaint was ever served on the respondent.  This additional complaint does not carry
with it a post office registry receipt to show that complainant attempted to
furnish respondent a copy thereof:  neither does the record of the proceedings before the Investigating
Judge (to whom the additional complaint was referred) show that Judge Fernandez
had ordered a copy to be served on respondent.  The second additional complaint is not under oath.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that an administrative complaint, being accusatorial in nature,
must be sworn to; otherwise, it should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further to the matter of due process, while respondent may not
have been able to rebut the evidence complainant presented during the 11
October 1990 and 16 October 1990 hearings, he has only himself <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

pending administrative case against him, but he nevertheless changed his
residence without notifying this <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Court
or </span>the Regional Trial Court or the complainant of his new address.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the charges made in the original complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect to the charge of malversation the Investiga­ting Judge
found that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“On 16 October 1986 Atty. Alberto Lumakang counsel for the
plaintiff re-Marcela Requillo v. Rene Victoria Rincal <u>Civil Case No. 86-14</u>
for Repurchase and Damages, consigned in court <s>P</s><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Panabo, Davao Savings Bank, BPI Family Bank and Rural Bank of Panabo, (pages
9-12 Folio)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent admitted in his Answer the consignation of <s>P</s>28,000.00
by Atty. Alberto Lumakang re-Civil Case No. 86-14 and asserted that the amount
is intact but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">respondent did not
divulge to complainant because of his fear that Judge Mariano C. Tupas might
use.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>This is preposterous because had respondent deposited the amount
with <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the Municipal Treasurer </span>Office
or any of the banks in Panabo, he will not be liable for malversation.  The amount could have been truly 'intact'
rather than his self-serving assertion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Incidentally, an order dated 17 October 1989 was issued by Judge
Eugenio Valles detailed then at RTC Branch 4, Panabo, direct[ing] Caballero to
come to court within five (5) days from receipt of said order and deliver the
amount of <s>P</s>28,000.00 which he received by consignation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent failed to comply, hence a warrant of arrest was issued
on 8 January 1989 for failure to obey lawful order.  However, this remained unserved because of respondent's unknown
whereabout (sic) notwithstanding efforts exerted to contact him in Panabo or
Pantukan,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> Davao."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
