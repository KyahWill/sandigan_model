Pascual Garcia and Franco Loyola, was arraigned with a negative plea as the other accused, Pepe Loto, has successfully evaded his arrest under the warrant previously issued by this Court and remains at-large up to the present time.&nbsp; Thus, accused Paquito Loto is the only one who has been tried in these two (2) cases.<br><br>"The theories of the prosecution in the cases at bar appear to be moored on the following witnesses, who were presented at the witness stand on separate occasions, to wit:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> MOISES SAMSON,</span> 42 years old, single, a radio technician and a resident of Phase IV, Block 64, Lot 16, Bulihan, Silang, Cavite.&nbsp; In his direct testimony, he recalled that at about 5:30 o'clock in the afternoon of January 3, 1991, he was inside their house, at its upper floor, when he overheard the voice of Paquito Loto emanating from their sala at the ground floor and the latter was angry at his brother, Felix Samson; that he went down to verify the commotion and he saw accused Paquito Loto holding a stainless kitchen knife, which is pointed and with a length of less than twelve (12) inches and stabbed his brother, Felix, with it; that he then tried to help his brother but the other accused, Pepe Loto, emerged with a knife, and stabbed him hitting his hand in the process; and that he thereafter parried the other blows delivered by the same accused against him and he was again stabbed at his armpit.<br><br>"This witness also stated on direct examination that his brother, Felix Samson, was brought to the De la Salle University Medical Center, Dasmariñas, Cavite, where the latter was attended to by the doctors.&nbsp; However, despite his medical treatment and attendance, Felix Samson died on January 16, 1991.<br><br>"Moises Samson also alleged in his testimony that he was likewise brought to the same hospital where he was operated on his wounds.&nbsp; He was discharged on January 12, 1991.&nbsp; According to him, the incidents involving him and his brother could be attributed to an altercation between Felix and accused Paquito Loto which occurred in the month of October 1990 and/from that time, the accused harbored a grudge against them.&nbsp; Likewise, this witness claimed that prior to the stabbing incidents, he overheard Paquito Loto and his wife quarreling with each other inside their house, which is about two (2) meters away from their (Samson's) house.<br><br>"On cross-examination, Moises Samson stated that he knows accused Paquito Loto for a long time as they are neighbors but he had no knowledge that the same accused is disabled physically; that he is not aware of any altercation between his brother, Felix, and accused Pepe Loto, nor any incident wherein his brother went to the house of the said accused where he challenged the latter to a fistfight.<br><br>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; DAVID SAMSON, 43 years old, single and a resident of Phase IV, Block 63, Lot 16 Bulihan, Silang, Cavite.&nbsp; On direct examination, he testified that he is a brother of the victims in these cases; that at about 5:30 o'clock in afternoon of the same date, he was at the sala of their house with his father and brother, Felix Samson, while brother Moises and a sister, Edith, were both upstairs; that Paquito Loto suddenly entered their house without their permission and smiled at Felix; that when the same accused was near Felix, he pulled the left hand of the latter, twisted it a <b>little bit and forced</b> Felix to stand; that when Felix was turning his back a little in an effort to struggle, he saw accused stabbed Felix at his left side; that he has known accused Paquito Loto for about two (2) years, the latter being a construction worker; that he knows that said accused met an accident which damaged his hand although he had seen him performed his duty as such worker and held carpenter's tools with his hands; and that he cannot agree to the proposition that same accused cannot hold a knife and cannot use his damaged hands normally as he saw him holding hollow blocks with his hands and a knife as well before the date of the incident.<br><br>"On cross-examination, David Samson stated that he does not know of any misunderstanding between Pepe Loto and his brother, Felix, before the stabbing incident occurred.&nbsp; He admitted though that Paquito Loto and Felix had an altercation sometime in October, 1990 near their house; that said accused insulted Felix on such altercations causing Felix to become angry; and that he does not know that a complaint was filed by the same accused against Felix on account of such altercation/incident.<br><br>"The medico-legal certificate issued by the attending physician of the deceased Felix Samson (Exhibit 'A-1' as well as the Death Certificate (Exhibit 'A') clearly shows that the said victim suffered a `stab wound 9th ICS (L) Infrascapular with Hermothorax, penetrating Abdomen Empyema thoracis, UGIB sc. to Peptic Ulcer; Sepsis'. On the other hand, the other victim, Moises Samson, per Medico-Legal Report of his attending physician (Exhibit 'B') will disclose that the former suffered the following injuries, namely: 'Hacking wound Palm Zone II (L) Hand, Stab Wound (R) Axillary area' which necessitated an operation of the victim consisting of 'Neurorapphy 4th/5th digit, Debridement/wound Exploration, Suturing of Laceration (L) Hand and (R) Axillary area.' The same medical findings were admitted by the defense prompting the prosecution to dispense with the presentation of the doctors.<br><br>"Accused Paquito Loto's line of defense puts it that on the date and time indicated in the informations, he was at their house, which is three (3) meters away, more or less, from the house of the Samson family, with his wife and children when he saw Felix Samson approached their dwelling with a knife in hand and shouted the following: 'Papatayin ko kayo!'; that Pepe Loto, the other accused immediately went out of their house while his father locked their door for fear that Felix Samson and others might go inside their house; that he did not know what happened thereafter and as far as he is concerned, he was not a participant to the incidents in question nor knew anything about it as he did not even see his brother.&nbsp; The accused also denied the testimonies of Moises and David Samson that he entered the residence of the Samson family and stabbed Felix Samson, claiming that he does not know who stabbed the deceased.<br><br>"On cross-examination, he stated that when he saw Felix Samson, the latter was already at the door of their house and was then armed with a knife; that he does not know if his brother, Pepe, was armed when he went out of their house; and that after his brother went out of their door, he and his 76 year old father just let his brother go and after their door was closed, he did not mind anymore what would happen outside of their house.&nbsp; He also stated that he did not notice what happened afterwards because of the noise created by his four (4) children inside their house."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>Paquito Loto was acquitted for "insufficiency of evidence" in TG-1735-91 but he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder in TG-1736-91.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision handed down by the Honorable Julieto P. Tabiolo, Presiding Judge of Branch 18 of the Regional Trial Court, Tagaytay City, read:<br><br><blockquote>''WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing facts and considerations, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<br><br>"(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. TG-1735-91, for insufficiency of evidence, this Court finds accused Paquito Loto NOT GUILTY and accordingly, he is hereby acquitted of the charge filed against him in this case;<br><br>"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Criminal Case No. TG-1736-91, this Court finds accused Paquito Loto GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as principal in the crime of Murder, as this felony is defined and penalized under the provisions of Article 248, paragraph (1) of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no modifying circumstance which would aggravate or mitigate his liability, hereby sentences said accused to suffer the penalty of <span style="font-style: italic;">Reclusion Perpetua</span>; and to pay the heirs of the deceased Felix Samson the sum of P50,000.00, as actual damages, and likewise to indemnify the same heirs in the sum of P50,000.00, plus costs.<br><br>"With respect to the remaining accused, Pepe Loto, let the instant cases be as it is hereby ordered ARCHIVED to be revived and reincluded in the active calendar of this Court once the same accused is finally apprehended and brought to this Court for appropriate proceedings.&nbsp; Furthermore, let an lias warrant for the arrest of the same accused be issued in these cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>In now questioning his conviction, Paquito Loto ascribes grave error on the part of the trial court in giving full weight and credit to the evidence of the prosecution and in thereby discarding the theory of the defense.&nbsp; Appellant states that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are best described for their improbabilities and inconsistencies.<br><br>We have reviewed rather closely the records ourselves, and we find hardly anything that can impel us to sustain the appeal.&nbsp; On the contrary, the findings of the court <span style="font-style: italic;">a quo</span> are fully substantiated by, and appear clearly congruous with, the evidence adduced.<br><br>Moises Samson was positive in identifying accused-appellant to be the assailant of the deceased victim.
