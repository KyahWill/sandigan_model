				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is a petition for <em>certiorari</em> to quash the temporary res­training orders dated August 25, 1966 and January 9, 1967, which were issued by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 37884-R, Aranzanso, et al. vs. Santos de Parreño, et al. <p>It appears from the answer of the respondents herein that the aforesaid case was dismissed on December 12, 1966, and a motion for reconsideration was denied on February 20, 1967.&nbsp; The manifestation of the petitioners herein dated June 2, 1967, confirms the information given by the respondents and also states that the dismissal of the case has become final and unappealable. </p> <p>It thus appears that there is no need for a decision in this case in view of the fact that the temporary restraining orders were dissolved upon the dismissal of the case by the Court of Appeals. </p> <p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the case is dismissed for being moot and academic.&nbsp; No special pronouncement as to costs. </p> <p><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><em>Aquino</em><em>, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, De Castro, </em>and<em> Escolin, JJ.,</em>concur.<br><em>Barredo</em><em>, (Chairman), J., </em>no part, as I am a party to this case. </p></div>
