<p class="BODY">The police authorities conducted an investigation and thereafter
took down the sworn statements of witnesses.  In due time, an information charging the accused-appellant and one Luis
Canalan y Bacatano with the crime of Murder was filed in the Regional Trial
Court (RTC) of Quezon City.  Docketed as
Criminal Case No. Q-43760, it was raffled off to Branch 98 of the said
court.  After both accused pleaded not
guilty on arraignment, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">trial on the

<blockquote>"Pio Ang operated a junk shop at Cherryville Subdivision,
Novaliches, Quezon City.  Among his
employees were Temistocles Castor and Sotero Roy who, together with his wife,
Edmunda, was (sic) allowed to stay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">inside
the compound of the junk shop.  Aside
from Sotero and his wife, Robert Mingoa and Jimmy Hao, brothers of Pio Ang,
also lived in a house inside the compound (TSN, August 24, 1989, pp. 12-13, 18,
20; </span>TSN, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">August 22, 1989, pp.
6-8).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 1, 1986, Sotero alias Vietcong and Castor quarreled over an
allegation that Castor had an amorous relation with Sotero's wife,
Edmunda.  Before the two (2) could
exchange blows, however, they were pacified by their co-workers.  But before leaving, Castor threatened Sotero
that if he had an opportunity, he would kill him (TSN, August 24, 1989, pp.
9-10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Two weeks after the said incident, particularly on May 17, 1986,
about (sic) 8:00 o'clock in the evening, Castor made good his threat.  Together with a companion named Palping,
Castor stabbed Sotero near the gate inside the junk shop compound.  Despite the wounds inflicted on him, Sotero
was able to run away from his attackers towards the house being occupied by
Robert Mingoa and Jimmy Hao, about ten (10) meters from the gate.  But he was followed inside the house by
Castor and Palping who continued their attack until Sotero slumped on the
floor, mortally wounded (TSN, August 22, 1989, pp. 3-4, 11).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Unknown to Castor and his companion, the whole incident was
witnessed by Robert Mingoa who was then standing a few meters from the
gate.  Mingoa was about to leave for his
friend's house when he saw Castor and his companions stab Sotero near the
gate.  Afraid that the attackers might
turn against him, Mingoa ran towards his house where the victim ran to, and
went directly inside his room and locked himself in.  While in his room, Mingoa heard a commotion inside the house and,
peeping through a partially opened window, saw Castor and Palping once again
stab Sotero.  Thereafter, Sotero finally
slumped on the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> floor.  Mingoa clearly witnessed the incident as the
place where the incident took place was lighted (Ibid, pp. 3-5, 11-12).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Patrolmen Dante Laguelles and Salvacion of the Station
Investigation Division, Quezon City Police, rushed to the scene of the crime
following a call from Pio Ang.  They
found at the scene the lifeless body of Sotero, drenched in blood.  They took pictures of the victim, searched
the place for any instrument used in perpetrating the crime, and questioned
witnesses.  Temistocles Castor and Luis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Canalan, who surfaced as the prime suspects
in the killing, were subsequently arrested in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila and
Plaridel, Bulacan, respectively (TSN, October 25, 1989, pp. 4-6).</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assigned error, accused-appellant seeks to
convince this Court of the unreliability of the testimony of Robert Mingoa
because of its inherent inconsistencies -- especially with respect to the place
where the stabbing took place.  While
initially, Mingoa testified that the stabbing occurred near the gate, he later
claimed that it took place inside the house.  The accused-appellant also capitalized on Mingoa's inability to give the
complete names of the victim and the latter's co-employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second error, accused-appellant maintains that alibi is
the only defense available to him; he could not claim any other credible
defense, like self-defense, in the absence of any fact that "could lend
evidence (sic) to such defense."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> He further
stresses that the Court should not harbor a mental prejudice against an accused
who invokes the defense of alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the last assigned error, accused-appellant insists
that his guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt; and even
assuming, for the sake of argument, that he was responsible for the death of
Sotero Roy, he can only be held liable for homicide since no qualifying
circumstances were proven by the prosecution.  The threat uttered on 1 May 1986 was made in the heat of a quarrel;
there was no evidence to show that he intended to make good the same.  On the contrary, both he and the victim
continued to work together, thus indicating that he did not cling to his
determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">This appeal is unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">inconsistencies </span>in

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the alleged inconsistency regarding the place
where the incident took place results from a misappreciation of the totality of
the testimony of Robert Mingoa.  The
latter did not say that the attack on the victim commenced and ended in the
house.  On the contrary, he
categorically declared that the victim was initially stabbed near its
gate.  It was after this first attack that
the latter rushed towards the house.  The assailants then followed him and continued their attack inside the
house.  Moreover, there is absolutely no
evidence to indicate any ulterior or improper motive which would have caused
Robert Mingoa to testify against the accused except to see to it that justice
be done.  This absence of improper
motive further enhanced his credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Finally, Mingoa's failure to state<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>the
complete names of the victim and the latter's co-employees has no bearing
whatsoever on the case and is entirely irrelevant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly discredited accused-appellant's defense
of alibi.  We have held that this
defense can be availed of only when there is no clear evidence of the presence
and participation of an accused in the crime charged, and it is impossible for
him to be physically present at the crime scene at the time it was committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Otherwise stated, it cannot prevail over a positive identification of the
accused,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
and will not be appreciated where it was not impossible for the latter to have
been present at the time of the commission of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

In the instant case, accused-appellant and his companion Palping were
positively identified by Robert Mingoa as the perpetrators of the crime.  For this reason alone, the defense of alibi
is worthless.  Moreover, the
accused-appellant was allegedly in Caloocan City when the victim was attacked
and killed in Novaliches, Quezon City.  The former did not show that it was physically impossible for him to
have been in Novaliches at that particular time by reason of the distance
between these two places.  This Court
takes judicial notice of the proximity of Caloocan City to Novaliches, Quezon
City and concludes that it was not impossible for the accused-appellant to have
been present at the scene of the crime at the time of the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the protestations of innocence by the accused-appellant are
belied by his flight.  He did not report
for work the day after the incident.  Furthermore, he left his residence, which was at his place of work in
Novaliches, and moved to Caloocan City in the evening of 17 May 1986 where he
stayed for one week with Palping.  Thereafter, he transferred to Mandaluyong where he remained until his
arrest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

He offered no acceptable explanation as to why he so suddenly left his
employment -- his only source of livelihood -- and why he had to move from one
place to another.  It has long been
settled that the flight of the accused is competent evidence against him as
having a tendency to establish his guilt;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> unexplained

circumstances, namely evident premeditation, treachery and the accused's taking
advantage of superior strength.  The
evidence for the prosecution established beyond reasonable doubt, through the
testimony of Armando Baldemoro, that on 1 May 1986, the victim and the
accused-appellant quarreled over the latter's alleged amorous relation with the
formers wife, Edmunda.  Before the two
could come to blows, co-workers intervened and pacified them.  However, before leaving, accused-appellant
threatened Sotero, saying that given the opportunity, he would kill the latter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
The killing occurred sixteen (16) days later.  At that time, accused-appellant purposely brought along Palping;
together, they attacked the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">These facts unerringly show that the qualifying circumstance of
evident premeditation<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
attended the killing of the victim.  To
properly appreciate this circumstance, it is necessary to show (a) the time when
the offender determined to commit the crime; (b) an act manifestly indicating
that he had clung to his determination; and (c) a sufficient lapse of time
between the determination and the execution to allow him to reflect upon the
consequences of his act and to allow his conscience to overcome the resolution
of his will had he desired to hearken to its warnings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Sixteen (16) days afforded accused-appellant more than enough time to reflect
upon the consequences of his act.  Anent
the second requisite, the accused-appellant showed that he had clung to his
resolution by entering into a conspiracy with Palping to eliminate Sotero Roy
so he could have Edmunda all to himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the allegation of abuse of superior strength, which is
a relative circumstance, We find that the same was not adequately proven.  Mere superiority in number is not enough;
there must exist proof of deliberate intent to take advantage of superior
strength.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Treachery was not likewise established.  There is treachery when the offender commits any of the crimes against
persons, employing means, methods or forms in the execution thereof which tend
directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to himself arising
from the defense which the offended party might make.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

In the instant case, Robert Mingoa, the lone eyewitness, was not able to
observe the commencement of the assault; he could, therefore, not testify on
how it all began and developed.  In <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">United States vs. Perdon</span></i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

this<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>Court ruled that where no
particulars are known as to the manner in which the aggression was made or how
the act which resulted in the death of the victim began and developed,
treachery cannot be appreciated to qualify the killing.  Thus, it cannot be considered where the lone
eyewitness did not see the commencement of the assault.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, the victim sustained two (2) stab wounds in his chest and
two (2) stab wounds in his back.  The
chest wounds could have very well resulted from an initial frontal attack on
the victim; thus, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span>possible
that the latter could have even offered some resistance by parrying the thrusts
of the assailants.  This is evidenced by
the "[W]ound incised, 3.0 cm. ... anterior aspect, chest, left."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
The possibility of this initial frontal attack and the absence of any proof
that the same was unexpected and sudden sustain a rejection of the qualifying
circumstance of treachery.</p>

<p class="BODY">With evident premeditation having been sufficiently established, the
killing of the victim, Sotero Roy, would amount to Murder, penalized under
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code by <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its
maximum period to death.  Since neither
aggravating nor mitigating circumstances were proven, the penalty, pursuant to
Article 64(1) of the Revised Penal Code, should be imposed in its medium
period.  Considering Section 19(1),
Article III of the 1987 Constitution which prohibits the imposition of the
death penalty, and the rule enunciated in <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
