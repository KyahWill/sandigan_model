<p class="BODY">The proceedings in the court below from which this appeal arose,
as found by respondent Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co. (Metropolitan) in
whose favor a deed of chattel mortgage was executed by Good Earth Emporium,
Inc. (GEE) over certain air conditioning units installed <span style="">in </span>the GEE building, filed a com<span style="">p</span>laint for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Uniwide</span> Sales, <span style="">Inc. </span>(<span class="SpellE">Uniwide</span>, for brevity) and the
BPI Investment Corporation and several other banks collectively called
BPI-Consortium, for the recovery of the possession of the air-conditioning
units or in the event they may not be recovered, for the defendants which
acquired the GEE building in an auction sale, (to) be required, jointly and
severally, to pa<span style="">y</span> the plaintiff
the unpaid obligations on the units.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Per paragraph 3.11.3 of its complaint, <span style="">p</span>laintiff <span class="SpellE">Metrobank</span>
alleged that the air?conditioning units were installed on a loan of P
4,900,000.00 it extended to Good Earth Emporium &amp; Supermarket, Inc. in its
building located at <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, Sta. Cruz, Manila,
after the land and building had been foreclosed and purchased on June 3, 1983
at public auction by the defendants, except <span class="SpellE">Uniwide</span>,
and in order to secure repayment of the loan, a deed of chattel mortgage was
constituted over the personal properties listed in the deed which included the <span class="SpellE">airconditioning</span> units.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

motion for leave to intervene alleging 'it has a direct and immediate interest

such that it will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation, and effect
of the judgment’ and attached the 'Intervention Complaint' (Annex D. Petition, <u>id</u>.,
pp. 49-52).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no opposition to

filed a motion to admit amended complaint (Annex F. <span class="SpellE">Intervenor's</span>
Comment, <u>id</u>., p. 110) and attached the Amended Intervention Com­plaint
(Annex J. Petition, <u>id</u>.; pp. 68-73) to the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this motion, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Metrobank</span>

filed their Reply (Annex L, Petition, <u>id</u>., pp.<span style=""> </span>77-81) and the plaintiff a Rejoinder (Annex M, Petition. <u>id</u>.,
pp. 82-­87), on January 11, 1989, the respondent court issued the order
admitting the amended complaint in intervention (Annex N, Petition, <u>id</u>.,

<p class="BODY">On April 14, 1989, p<span style="">etitioner
</span>filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with
respondent Court of Appeals contending that the lower court committed a grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in allowing, per its
order of June 2, 1988, the intervention suit to <span style="">survive </span>despite the dismissal of the main action and also in
admitting, per its order of January 11, 1989, the amended complaint in
intervention.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

issues and arguments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
Court of Appeals that the lower court was innocent of any grave abuse of
discretion in issuing the orders complained of.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioner that the order of the lower court,
dated <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1988</st1:date>, has the
effect of allowing the intervention suit to prosper despite the dismissal of
the main action obviously cannot be upheld. </p>

<p class="BODY">There is here no final dismissal of the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforementioned order of the lower court
has the effect not only of allowing the intervention suit to proceed but also
of vacating its previous order of dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reinstatement of the case in order to try and determine the claims
and rights of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> is proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The joint motion of therein plaintiff and the
original defendants to dismiss the case, without notice to and consent of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, has the effect of putting to rest only the
respective claims of the said original parties <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>se</u>,
but the same cannot in any way affect the claim of private respondent which was
allowed by the court to intervene without opposition from the original
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A resume of pertinent rulings
on the matter would be in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Intervention is defined as "a proceeding in a suit or action
by which a third person is permitted by the court to make himself a party,
either joining plaintiff in claiming what is sought by the complaint, or
uniting with defendant in resisting the claims of plaintiff, or demanding
something adversely to both of them; the act or proceeding by which a third
person becomes a party in a suit pending between others; the admission, by
leave of court, of a person not an original party to pending legal proceedings,
by which such person becomes a party thereto for the protection of some right
of interest alleged by him to be affected by such proceedings."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Any person who has or claims an interest in the matter in
litigation, in the success of either of the parties to an action, or against
both, may intervene in such action, and when he has become a party thereto it
is error for the court to dismiss the action, including the intervention suit
on the basis of an agreement between the original parties to the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any settlement made by the plaintiff and the
defendant is necessarily ineffective unless the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>

<p class="BODY">By the very definition of "intervention,” the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> is a party to the action as the original parties

original parties, subject to the authority of the court reasonably to control
the proceedings in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It has even been held that the simple fact that the trial court

An <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> has the right to claim the benefit of

Where <span style="">a </span>complaint in intervention
was filed before <span style="">plaintiff's </span>action
had been expressly dismissed, the <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
complaint was not subject to dismissal on the ground that no action was
pending, since dismissal of plaintiff's action did not affect the rights of the
<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> or affect the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span> complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>An <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>

<p class="BODY">As we ruled <span style="">in </span><u>Camacho

the rationale whereof <span style="">is </span>clearly
applicable to the present controversy -</p>

<blockquote>"There is no question that intervention is only collateral or
ancillary to the main action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it
was previously ruled that the final dismissal of the principal action results
in the dismissal of said ancillary <span style="">action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The main action having ceased to
exist, there is no pending proceeding whereon the intervention may be
based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, however,
there <span style="">was </span>no such final or
complete dismissal but rather an approval of a compromise agreement which was
embodied <span style="">in </span>what was specifically
designated as <span style="">a </span>'Partial
Decision’ affecting only the interests of herein petitioner and the defendant
in said case but not those of her co-plaintiff municipality and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
clear intent of the court below in making the partial decision is to make a
reservation to determine th<span style="">e</span>
rights of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> and, presumably, the
plaintiff municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There may be
nothing much left to be done with respect to the main case but as <span style="">far </span><span style="">as </span>the proceedings in the trial court are concerned, the
controversy therein has not <span style="">been </span>fully
settled and the disposition of the case is definitely incomplete."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover,</span> to
require private <span style="">res</span>pondent to <span class="SpellE">refile</span> another case for the settlement of its claim will
result in unnecessary delay and expenses and will multiplicity of suits and,
therefore, defeat the very purpose of intervention which <span style="">is to h</span>ear and determine at the same
time all conflicting claims which may <span style="">be
</span>made on the subject matter in litigation, and to expedite litigation and
settle in one action and by a single judgment the whole controversy among the
persons <span style="">involved.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="1">January 11, <span style="">1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, admitting private </span>respondent's amended complaint in
intervention, <span style="">we sustain respondent </span>Court
of Appeals in upholding the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Incidentally, it will be recalled that petitioner was granted the
opportunity to file, as it did file, its <span style="">answer
</span>to the amended complaint in intervention and it <span style="">even </span>interposed a counterclaim <span style="">in </span>the process.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the granting of leave to file an amended <span style="">pleading is a matter </span>particularly
addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and that discretion is
broad, subject only to the limitations that the amendments should not
substantially change the cause of action or alter the theory of the case or
that it was made to delay the action.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Once exercised, that discretion will not be disturbed on appeal, except in case
of abuse thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, a reading of the amended complaint in
intervention shows that it merely supplements an incomplete allegation of the
cause of action stated in the original complaint so as to submit the real
matter in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to
petitioner's contention, it does not substantially change <span class="SpellE">intervenor's</span>
cause of action or alter the theory of the case, hence its allowance is in
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly stated by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"In both the Intervention Complaint and the Amended Complaint
in Intervention, the private respondent seeks the payment to it of the amount
of P150,000.00 which should have been paid to it from out of the P650.000.00
which the petitioner as plaintiff in CC 86-3618 had referred to in pars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.11.2 and 3.11.3 of its complaint as cost of
installation of the <span class="SpellE">airconditioning</span> units under the
agreement of sale (between plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Metrobank</span> and
GEE Inc.) dated <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1984</st1:date>
and so basically, the Amended Complaint In Intervention did not really detract
or depart from that basic claim.”<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether a different cause of action is introduced
by amendments to the complaint, what is to be ascertained is whether the
defendant shall be required to answer for a liability or legal obligation
wholly different from that which was stated in the original complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An amendment will not be considered as
stating a new cause of action if the facts alleged in the amended complaint
show substantially the same wrong with respect to the same transaction, or if
what are alleged refer to the same matter but are more fully and differently
stated, or where averments which were implied are made in expressed terms, and
the subject of the controversy or the liability sought to be enforced remains
the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The courts should be liberal in allowing amendments to pleadings
to avoid multiplicity of suits and in order that the real controversies between
the parties are presented, their rights determined and the case decided on the
merits without unnecessary delay.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
This liberality is greatest in the early stages of a lawsuit,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
especially in this case where the amendment to the complaint in intervention
was made before trial of the case thereby giving petitioner all the time
allowed by law to answer and to prepare for trial.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue regarding the propriety of the intervention, suffice
it to state that petitioner's failure to interpose a timely objection when the
motion for leave to intervene was filed by private respondent bars the former
from belatedly questioning the validity of the same on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the trial court duly considered
