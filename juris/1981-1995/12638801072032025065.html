<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure, the Court of Appeals resolved to certify this case to this Court for
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the
appellate court is accompanied by a report recommending <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the appealed decision, and the imposition of the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of facts of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, it was established that at time of the
incident on December 19, 1985 the offended party, Elaine Cesar, was only 12
years and 6 months old and a mere 6th grader while the accused was already 20
years old and a 4th year college student; and that the accused is a sexually
hot individual as borne by the fact that he admittedly masturbates at least
once a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The offended party, Elaine
Cesar, testified in a simple, honest and straight-forward manner whereas the accused
testified in an evasive and sometimes incredible and inconsistent manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elaine, at the time of the incident, being
only 12 years and 6 months old and a mere Grade 6 student, was quite gullible
and easily deceived by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
Court also noted that the accused admitted, on cross-examination, that he and
Elaine agreed that they would stay in the Champion Lodging House for only 'a
short time which would be for 3 to 4 hours' only.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It also appeared from the testimony of the accused that they left
Lyceum at about 3:25 P.M. and then took the LRT at the Central Station and
alighted at the LRT Station at <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> Jose St., and
then they proceeded on foot to the Champion Lodging House which is located
along <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue between <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
Jose and <span class="SpellE">Zurbaran</span> Street, so that the accused and
Elaine must have arrived at the said motel between 4 to 5 P.M. on December 19,
1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused failed to explain why
they overstayed and left that motel only at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="7">7:30
 A.M.</st1:time> on the following day, <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="12">December
 20, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
claimed that when they first arrived at that motel in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1985</st1:date>, he phoned his
house and talked to her sister, Imelda, to tell his family that he would arrive
home late that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to satisfy
his lustful desires, the accused who is a sexually hot person, drugged the soft
drink or pineapple juice which Elaine later drank inside the room in that motel
so that she became dizzy and eventually lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once Elaine was unconscious, the accused
raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the accused,
they were very tired after walking so much on December 19, 1985 so that when
they arrived inside the room of the Champion Lodging House in the afternoon of
that day, the first thing they did was to order two glasses of pineapple juice
to quench their thirst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet according
to the accused he alone drank the two glasses of pineapple juice while Elaine
did not, so that his testimony on that point is incredible, being against the
common experience of mankind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
both tired and thirsty after having walked around so much and they both needed
a drink badly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When she woke up at 5:00 A. M. on the following morning, December
20, 1985, Elaine found blood on her private part or vagina and she felt pain in
her body; when she asked the accused what happened, the accused lied by saying
that nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following
day, <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1985</st1:date>,
when Elaine told her mother what happened at the motel, her mother got angry
and lost no time in bringing her to the PC Crime Laboratory before <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon to have Elaine
physically examined by the expert Medico-Legal Examiner, Col<span class="GramE">./</span>Dr.
Gregorio Blanco.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Blanco testified
positively that in the course of his physical examination of Elaine, he found
her hymen to have a fresh laceration at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00
 o'clock</st1:time> and that said fresh laceration meant that there was a very
recent sexual intercourse, and he also concluded that the child, Elaine Cesar,
was therefore in a non-virgin state because of that fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the accused first met
Elaine, Cesar only on September 11, 1985, it is difficult to believe that the
said young girl, being only 12 years and 6 month old at that time, would have
consented to go with the accused to a motel on December 19, 1985 for the
purpose of submitting her virginity to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused also admitted on cross-examination that while he and Elaine
were inside the room in that motel that he kissed and embraced Elaine and that
he asked Elaine to give her virginity to him "three times".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, being much older than Elaine,
took advantage of, deceived and abused the latter sexually by raping her when
she was unconscious on account of her having drunk the drugged soft drink or
pineapple juice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense’s evidence,
more particularly the two pictures (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1 and 2) of
Elaine Cesar including the tenderly-worded handwritten dedication (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-A) at the back of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">1,</span> did not disprove the fact that the accused raped the
child, Elaine Cesar, while she was unconscious inside the room of the Champion
Lodging House.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The straight-forward testimony of Elaine Cesar as well as the
testimony of the disinterested witness, Col/Dr. Blanco, that his physical
examination of Elaine Cesar on December 20, 1985 at the PC Crime Laboratory
revealed that her hymen had a fresh laceration at 5 o'clock and which indicated
recent sexual intercourse was not over-turned by the evidence of the defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this connection, it has been held that absence of spermatozoa
does not disprove rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Calainquim</span>, 125 SCRA 655).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the ability to resist is taken away by administering drugs, even
though the woman may be conscious, sexual intercourse with her is rape (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Lintag</span>, 126 SCRA 511).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In rape, there must be sexual
intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Penetration even <span class="GramE">partial,</span> is necessary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The slightest penetration is enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of emission is not necessary.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful review of the records of the case there is no question
that on that fateful day of December 19, 1985 Elaine and appellant were
together from 7:00 o'clock in the morning when they met in front of the Fargo
Department Store in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City when they attended
the Christmas party at the Manila Central University, where Elaine was
enrolled, up to 10:00 A.M..<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
they proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span> where they took a
stroll.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then they went to the Fiesta
Carnival at <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> and they ate at a
nearby Mc Donald's restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
later proceeded to Lyceum where appellant took his examinations at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="14">2:30 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then he fetched Elaine at the canteen where she was waiting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They rode the metropolitan light rail transit
at the Central Station up to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span>
  Jose Street</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon alighting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, they walked to the
Champion Lodging House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After drinking
two glasses of pineapple juice, they had sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They stayed overnight in the said motel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The focal question is whether the account of Elaine in that she
was only forced to go to the motel and that she was made to drink the soft
drink so that she lost consciousness is true and supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elaine admitted that she knew appellant some three months before
the alleged incident took place because they were neighbors, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>.,
she resided with her grandmother in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City
during her school days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, they
fell in love with each other for Elaine gave appellant her photograph marked
Exhibit 1 with her handwritten dedication.</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="12">12-6-86</st1:date></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This picture was given by Elaine to appellant while they were
inside the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span> Theater on <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1985</st1:date> and because of this memento,
he kissed her out of joy, according to appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he courted Elaine for a few weeks and
she accepted his proposal by phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
went out three times to see a movie, that is, in October, 1985, <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1985</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was while at <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span>
Theater on December 18 that Elaine invited appellant to accompany her to her
class Christmas party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the
following day, appellant informed his mother of the invitation and she
permitted him and gave him P50.00 pocket money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 A.M.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1985</st1:date> to the following
morning, they were together, going from one place to the other, until they
slept together in the lodging house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no force or compulsion involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a day of joy for the two young
lovers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant did not drug Elaine to
lay with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in love with him
and did not hesitate to surrender her virginity to her sweetheart upon a
promise of marriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contradictions in the testimony of Elaine where she attempted
to prove that their coition was involuntary rather than fortify the case of the
prosecution, served to demolish the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, while Elaine claimed she was dragged to the hotel, her
medical examination did not reveal any contusions on her body showing use of
any force on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if she was
under any compulsion, she could easily have escaped during the many hours they
were together going from one place to another, but she did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was enjoying their tryst.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, if she was really drugged she should have been given at
least a blood and urine test to determine if there were any remaining chemicals
in her system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, after the incident, Elaine was composed and was not
disturbed at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not show any
sign of having had a traumatic experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when her mother scolded her that she contrived her story.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, in one part of her <span class="SpellE"><u>Sagot</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span></u> submitted to the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office, she said she did not accept the invitation of appellant for them to go
to the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In another part thereof, she said she accepted the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In court, she said she agreed to go to the <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and thereafter she said she was forced.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She also stated in her <span class="SpellE"><u>Sagot</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span></u> that she was only persuaded to give appellant
her photograph and appellant dictated what she wrote thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In court she admitted she gave the photograph to appellant and that appellant
did not ask her to write the dedication thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the foregoing <span class="GramE">circumstances effectively
disproves</span> the theory of force and involuntariness in the sexual
interlude of the two.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is obvious and clear is that these two young lovers, carried
by their mutual desire for each other, in a moment of recklessness, slept
together and thus consummated the fruition of their brief love affair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant cannot be held liable for rape as
there was none committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
consensual affair.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, based on the evidence the crime committed by
appellant is simple seduction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
338 of the Revised Penal Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 338.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Simple
seduction</u>. - The seduction of a woman who is single or a widow of good
reputation, over twelve but under eighteen years of age, committed by means of
deceit, shall be punished by <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All the elements of the offense are present.</p>

<blockquote>Frankly -</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elaine was over 12 and under 18 years of
age.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She is single and of good reputation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The offender had sexual intercourse with
her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It was committed by deceit.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant said he planned to marry Elaine and for this reason he
successfully persuaded her to give up her virginity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the deceit contemplated by law that
attended the commission of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Rule 120 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal procedure
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span> <span class="GramE"><u>Judgment
in case of variance between allegation and proof</u>.</span> - When there is
variance between the offense charged in the complaint or information, and that

in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused shall be convicted
of the offense proved included in that which is charged, or of the offense
charged included in that which is proved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, the essential ingredients of simple seduction are
not alleged nor necessarily included in the offense charged in the
information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only <span class="GramE">elements
of the offense alleged in the sworn complaint of the offended party is</span>
that she is over 12 years of age when appellant had carnal knowledge of
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellant cannot be convicted
even for simple seduction either.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>
