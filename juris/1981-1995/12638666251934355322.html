a resolution of the Court En Banc was issued regarding the amounts claimed by
Atty. Bernardo F. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span> on the occasion of his
retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The resolution states, among
others:</p>

<blockquote>"The terminal leave pay of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span>
received by virtue of his compulsory retirement can never be considered a part
of his salary subject to the payment of income tax but falls under the phrase
‘other similar benefits received by retiring employees and workers’, within the
meaning of Section 1 of PD No. 220 and is thus exempt from the payment of
income tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the money value of his
accrued leave credits is not a part of his salary is further buttressed by Sec.
3 of PD No. 985, otherwise known as ‘The Budgetary Reform Decree on Compensation
and Position Classification of 1976’ particularly Sec. 3 (a) thereof, which
makes it clear that the <u>actual</u> <u>service</u> is the period of time <u>for</u>
<u>which</u> <u>pay</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>received,</u> <u>excluding</u>
<u>the</u> <u>period</u> <u>covered</u> <u>by</u> <u>terminal</u> <u>leave.</u>"</blockquote>

the amount of P59<span class="GramE">,502.33</span> which <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span>
opted to retire under the provisions of Republic Act 660, which is incorporated
in Commonwealth Act No. 186. Section 12(c) of CA 186 states:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

unused vacation leave and sick leave, based on the highest rate received, which
they may have to their credit at the time of retirement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Section
28(c) of the same Act, in turn, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except as herein
otherwise provided, the Government Service Insurance System, <u>all</u> <u>benefits</u>

or indirect, established or to be established; xxx." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Applying the two
aforesaid provisions, it can be concluded that the amount received by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span> as a result of the conversion of these unused
leaves into cash is exempt from income tax.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>The commutation of leave
credits is commonly known as <u>terminal</u> <u>leave</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Manual on Leave Administration Course for

from the service through no fault of his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="GramE">supra</span>, p. 16)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since terminal leave is applied for by an officer or employee who has already
severed his connection with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>employer
and who is no longer working, then it follows that the terminal leave pay,
which is the cash value of his accumulated leave credits, is no longer
compensation for services rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
can not be viewed as salary.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Executive Order No. 1077,

of the said official or employee." (Underlining supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span>, he
rendered government service from <st1:date month="3" day="13" year="1962">March
 13, 1962</st1:date> up to <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1990">February
 15, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day, or
on <st1:date month="2" day="16" year="1990">February 16, 1990</st1:date>, he
reached the compulsory retirement age of 65 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon his compulsory retirement, he is
entitled to the commutation of his accumulated leave credits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>its money value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Within the purview of the above-mentioned
provisions of the NIRC, compulsory retirement may be considered as a "<u>cause</u>
<u>beyond</u> <u>the</u> <u>control</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>said</u> <u>official</u>
<u>or</u> <u>employee</u>". Consequently, the amount that he received by
way of commutation of his accumulated leave credits as a result of his
compulsory retirement, or his terminal leave pay, falls within the enumerated
exclusions from gross income and is therefore not subject to tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The terminal leave pay
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span> may likewise be viewed as a "retirement
gratuity received by government officials and employees" which is also
another exclusion from gross income as provided for in Section 28(b), 7(f) of
the NIRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A gratuity is that paid to the
beneficiary for past services rendered purely out of generosity of the giver or
grantor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Peralta v. Auditor General,
100 Phil, 1051 [1957]) It is a mere bounty given by the government in
consideration or in recognition of meritorious services and springs from the
appreciation and graciousness of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Pirovano</span> v. De la <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship Co., 96 Phil. 335, 357 [1954]) When a
government employee chooses to go to work rather than absent himself and
consume his leave credits, there is no doubt that the government is thereby
benefited by the employee's uninterrupted and continuous service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in cognizance of this fact that laws
were passed entitling retiring government employees, among others, to the
commutation of their accumulated leave credits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That which is given to him after retirement is out of the Government's
generosity and an appreciation for his having continued working when he could
very well have gone on vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section
286 of Revised Administrative Code, as amended by RA 1081, provides that "whenever
any officer, employee or laborer of the Government of the Philippines shall
voluntarily resign or be <u>separated</u> from the service <u>through</u> <u>no</u>
<u>fault</u> <u>of</u> <u>his</u> <u>own</u>, he shall be <u>entitled</u> <u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>commutation</u> <u>of</u> <u>all</u> <u>accumulated</u><u style="text-underline:words"> </u><u>vacation</u> <u>and/or</u> <u>sick</u> <u>leave</u>
<u>to</u> <u>his</u> <u>credit:</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>xxx." (Underlining supplied) Executive Order No. 1077, mentioned
above, later amended Section 286 by removing the limitation on the number of
leave days that may be accumulated and explicitly allowing <u>retiring</u>
government employees to commute their accumulated leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The commutation of accumulated leave credits
may thus be considered a retirement gratuity, within the import of Section
28(b), 7(f) of the NIRC, since it is given only upon retirement and in
consideration of the retiree's meritorious services.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It is clear that the law
expresses the government's appreciation for many years of service already
rendered and the clear intention to reward faithful and often underpaid workers
after the official relationship had been terminated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Section 284 of the Revised
Administrative Code grants to a government employee 15 days vacation leave and
15 days sick leave for every year of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, even if the government employee absents himself and exhausts his
leave credits, he is still <u>deemed</u> to have worked and to have rendered
services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His leave benefits are already
imputed in, and form part of, his salary which in turn is subjected to
withholding tax on income.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is taxed
on the entirety of his salaries without any deductions for any leaves not
utilized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows then that the money
values corresponding to these leave benefits both the used and unused have
already been taxed during the year that they were earned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To tax them again when the retiring employee
receives their money value as a form of government concern and appreciation
plainly constitutes an attempt to tax the employee a second time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is tantamount to double taxation.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue seeks, in the alternative,
to be clarified with respect to the following:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">a</span>.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the
applicability of the <st1:date year="1990" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1990</st1:date>
Resolution to <u>other</u> government officials and employees; and</p>

<p class="BODY">b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>to those who have
already retired and from whose retirement benefits withholding taxes have been
deducted, whether or not the deducted taxes are refundable even without a
written request for refund from the taxpayer-retiree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of Atty. Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span>
(entitled Administrative Matter No. 90-6-015-SC) is merely an administrative
matter involving <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">an employee </span>of
this Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">who applied </span>for
retirement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">benefits and who </span>questioned
the deductions on the benefits given to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, our resolution applies only to employees of the Judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If we extend the effects of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">aforementioned resolution to all other
government employees, in the absence of an actual case and controversy, we
would in principle be rendering an advisory opinion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot foresee at this time and for all
cases all factors bearing upon the rights of government workers of varying
categories from diverse offices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
authorities concerned will have to determine and rule on each case as it
arises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Similarly situated"
is a most ambiguous and undefined term whose application cannot be fixed in
advance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">With respect to the need
for </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">written request for
refund, we rule that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span> need no longer
file a formal request for refund since the August 23, 1990 Resolution, which
principally deals with his case, already binds the <span class="SpellE">intervenor-movant</span>
Commissioner of Internal Revenue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, with respect to other retirees allegedly similarly situated and
from whom withholding taxes on terminal leave pay have been deducted, we rule
that these retirees should file a written request for refund within two years
from the date of promulgation of this resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fiscal considerations do not allow that this
matter be left hanging for an indefinite period while retirees make up their
minds as to whether or not they are entitled to refunds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

after and as direct consequences of retirement and would, in effect, constitute
double taxation, we rule that this resolution also applies to those who avail

service through no fault of their own.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court understands the
urgent need of Government to tap all possible sources of revenue because of its
heavy expenditures and the failure of actual income to cover all
disbursements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the solution is
not the levying of taxes on benefits and gratuities which by law are not
supposed to be taxed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remedy is to
either amend the retirement law subject, of course, to constitutional
constraints or to institute vastly improved and effective tax collection
efforts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
