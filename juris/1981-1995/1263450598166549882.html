<p class="BODY">In a letter-complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>dated July 2, 1980, Atty.

Y. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> of the Office of the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City "for conduct unbecoming of a public
officer and an officer of the court" in connection with the enforcement of
a writ of execution under Section 7 of Rule 141 of the Revised Rules of Court
pertaining to the payment of legal fees. </p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence discloses that complainant is the counsel for the
plaintiff in Civil Case No. VIII-34212 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Aldymac</span>,
Inc. vs. Facilities Printing, Inc." before Branch VIII of the City Court
of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City which issued the writ of execution for
the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the defendant and for collection of
unpaid rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1980</st1:date>, complainant instructed
his office messenger Ernesto N. <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> to go to the
Office of the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and deliver
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>,
Branch VIII assigned-deputy sheriff, the writ of execution including the sum of
P150.00 in cash for expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
receipt thereof, respondent told Ernesto N. <span class="SpellE">Monis</span>
that the P150.00 was not enough as he needed P500.00 for initial expenses,
exclusive of his "fee" for the recovery of the collectible amount of
P141<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, computed by him as 5% thereof, more or
less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having no authority to decide the
matter, <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> then called up Atty. Alberto O. <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span> by telephone to report that respondent was asking
for an additional amount of P350.00 to complete the initial expen­ses of
P500.00 aside from his "fee." When the respondent took the phone,
complainant asked him what it was he really wanted and respondent told the
complainant that he better <span style="">see </span>him in his office to discuss the matter because it was not
proper to take it up over the telephone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Responding, complainant then suggested to the respondent to meet him at
the 6th Floor of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City Hall</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:placename></st1:place> inasmuch as he
had to attend to a hearing in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Tensuan</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Branch the
following <span class="GramE">afternoon,</span> and respondent agreed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> returned
to the complainant's office, he told complainant that the respondent was asking
for a fee of 5% of the amount of P141<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
recoverable from the defendant under the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This demand shocked the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="6">June
 19, 1980</st1:date>, complainant <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span> saw
respondent <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> with a companion at the 6th Floor
of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City Hall</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant asked respondent if the law on
sheriff's fees had already been amended and respondent answered that the amount
of P500.00 was initially needed to pay the men who would help him in serving
the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When complainant
replied that no people were needed because no personal effects would be moved
out of the building as the equipment would only be levied upon, respon­dent
just kept quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When complainant
confronted him about the 5% fee, respondent answered that unless they agree on
his fee, he would not move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
not acceding to the 5% fee, respondent then told him to take up the matter with
Deputy Sheriff Roberto <span class="GramE">Garcia</span> whose telephone number,
98-85-09, was given to complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
when complainant tried to contact Garcia the following day as well as the days
thereafter, the latter was always out and he never returned com­plainant's
call.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1980</st1:date>,
complainant sent his messenger <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> to see
respondent and deliver a letter which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"<st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1980</st1:date></blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Sgd</span>) ALBERTO

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On that day, however, respondent was not
in his office, so <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> left the letter to one Rafael
<span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan</span> who told him to return the following day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Monis</span> returned to respondent's office and got back
from the latter the amount of P150.00 and the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant then called up Sheriff Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Abeja</span> of the Office of the City Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and inquired if he (<span class="SpellE">Abeja</span>)
would himself serve the <span style="">writ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span class="SpellE">Abeja</span>
consented, thus, the writ of execution was delivered to him the following day, <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
did not deny having asked from complainant the total amount of P500.00 which he
justified as necessary to properly serve and imple­ment the writ "inasmuch
as the properties that would be levied upon will thereafter be under the
custody of the sheriff, it would become necessary for the sheriff to have four
(4) guards posted in the premises where the printing equipment was found,
working eight (8) hours each for the twenty-four (24) hour-day, that <span style="">is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>one (1) guard for the night shift,
4:00 P.M. to 12:00 <span class="SpellE">M.N</span>.; two (2) guards for the
graveyard shift, 12:00 <span class="SpellE">M.N</span>. to 8:00 A.M.; and one (1)

But respondent denied having demanded 5% of the sum of P141<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as his fee, sta<span style="">t</span>ing that
"the same is not true, it being only a clever concoction of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span>, to add color to his baseless complaint against
the undersigned who is fully aware that no such fee has ever been demanded
and/or collected by any Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Judge Aloysius <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> of the
City Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, to whom this case was
referred by the Office of the Court Administrator for investigation, report and
recommendation, submitted his findings,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the undersigned
is convinced and so finds that, as borne out by the testimonies of the
complainant and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Monis</span>, the respondent not
only asked the complainant to give him an additional amount of P350.00 (in
addition to the P150.00 already given him) for expenses he anticipated would be
incurred in serving and implementing the subject writ of execution, but also
asked the complainant to first agree on his 'fee' of 5%, more or less, of the
amount of P141,000.00 collectible from the defendant, before he (respondent)
moves to serve and undersigned finds no cogent reason, cause, or motive for the
complainant, much less Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Monis</span>, to perjure or
testify falsely against the respondent herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That the respon­dent was not willing--indeed, that he refused--to move
to serve and implement the subject writ of execution unless he was first given
the additional amount of P350.00 and the com­plainant first agreed on his
'fee,' is amply indicated by the fact that while the said writ of execution had
been delivered to him for service as early as June 18, 1980, he did not make
any move to serve and implement the said writ up to the time <span class="SpellE">Monis</span> got it back on June 25, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Undersigned finds no probable cause or
reason for the respondent's inaction on the said writ from <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1980</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1980</st1:date>, other than the complainant's refusal to
accede to the respondent's demand for an additional amount of P350.00 and a
prior agreement between them on his 'fee.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Certainly, the respondent had no right to <span style="">ask </span>for such a 'fee' or even for such
additional amount of P350.00 for him to move to serve and implement the subject
writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What he asked for
does not find sanction in the Rules.</blockquote>

on all sums between four hundred pesos and two thousand pesos, one per centum;
on all sums in excess of two thousand pesos one-half per centum.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In sum, the undersigned finds that the respondent displayed
conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service; at the very least, it
tended to impair and vitiate the integrity of the court personnel as well as
the court itself."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
findings, Executive Judge Aloysius C. <span class="SpellE">Alday</span>
recommended that respondent Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> be found guilty of conduct prejudici<span style="">al </span>to the
best interest of the service (No. 27, Sec. 36(b) Presidential Decree No. 807)
and meted the penalty of forced resignation without prejudice to reinstatement
(No. 2, Sub-paragraph C, Paragraph IV, Civil Service Memorandum Circular No. 8,
Series of 1970).</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown by the evidence on the record, We find as established
and so hold, that respondent Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
demanded a fee of 5% of the recoverable amount of P141<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
mandated under the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
doing such a reprehensible act, which puts in bad light the court personnel and
the court itself, respondent <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>, as an officer
of the court, is guilty of malfeasance and gross misconduct in office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="GramE">denial of the charges
filed against him are</span> far from convincing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no motive for com­plainant Atty.
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Villaraza</span> to testify falsely against
respondent Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Relevant in the case at bar is the salutary reminder from this
Court that the image of a court of justice is necessarily mirrored in the
conduct, official or otherwise, of the men and women who work thereat, from the
judge to the least and lowest of its personnel - hence, it becomes the
imperative sacred duty of each and everyone in the court to maintain its good
name and standing as a true temple of justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
At the grassroots of <span class="GramE">Our</span> judicial machinery, sheriffs
and deputy sheriffs are indispensably in close con­tact with the contending
parties of a case, performing func­tions essential to the well-ordered
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus
imperative that respondent Deputy Sheriff, for one, must always remember the
yardstick of public service enshrined in Our Constitution under Section 1 of
Article XIII which stressed that a public office is a public trust and public
officers and employees must serve with the highest degree of responsibility,
integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, and at all times remain accountable to the
people.</p>

<p class="BODY">On one point, respondent should bear in mind that when a writ is
placed in his hands as a sheriff, it is his duty, in the absence of
instruction, to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute it
in accordance with its mandates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
no discretion whether to execute it or not.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the reprehensible act as demonstrated by the herein
respondent that undermines and erodes people's faith and confidence in the
administration of justice in <span class="GramE">Our</span> country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Displaying such conduct shows his unfitness
to continue in office.</p>

<p class="BODY">In reviewing the findings and recommendation of the investigating
Judge, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Executive Judge Aloysius C. <span class="SpellE">Alday</span>, Court Administrator Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>
of this Court expresses the opinion that for conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service, respondent <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> should be
separated from the service with prejudice to reemployment in any national or
local government office or agency, and with forfeiture of retirement
privileges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty recommended by
the Court Administrator is thus more severe than that recommended by the
investigating Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, being com­paratively
new in the position when respondent committed the offense, and not having been
previously charged administrative­ly, respondent may be accorded some degree of
compassion and leniency.</p>
