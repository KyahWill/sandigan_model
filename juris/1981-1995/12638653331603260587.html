<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, according to the People's counsel, are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On or about <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1984</st1:date>
at <span class="SpellE">Looban</span>, Block 14, Centro, <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, eight persons were playing bingo in the
house of the spouses Alfredo and Benita Flores.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two of the players were <span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Veron</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> (pp. 6-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1984</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long after her arrival and while seated
at the door of the balcony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> saw the accused <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> about six meters
away holding a basket containing claws of crabs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> (the victim) approached <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>,
took hold of the basket, and jokingly asked the latter to give him the crabs so
that he could roast them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> refused saying that he was bringing them home for
their viand (PP. 50-53 and 58-59, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Dec. 11,
1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Soon thereafter, the two were laughing although each of them was
grappling for the possession of the basket (pp. 53-54, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1984</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In order to gain advantage over <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> to
secure the possession of the basket, <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> held the
throat of <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> with his right hand (pp. 51-54, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11,
 1984</st1:date>). <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> however was able to remove
the hand of <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> and went at the back of the latter
(p. 80, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Dec. 11, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Veron</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>,
wife of Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>, saw them and shouted that
<span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> was being killed by <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This impelled accused Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>, who was inside the house of his parents-in-law
Alfredo and Benita Flores, to jump out of the house and proceed to the
scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Holding a bolo measuring 15 1/2
inches long (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C), Alfredo went behind <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> and stabbed him twice on the right side of his body
parallel to his navel (pp. 9-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1984</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> who was able to free himself from <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> drew his nine-inch kitchen knife from his waist and
also stabbed the victim twice (pp. 11-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">Dec. 11, 1984</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the stabbing was being perpetrated, accused Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. jumped out of the window of his house to join
the other accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Using a nine-inch
kitchen knife (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D) , he also stabbed <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> once.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
latter at the time was already immobile, lying prostrate on the ground (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Dec. 11, 1984)<span style="font-size:12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Mercedes <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>, mother of the victim,
heard the commotion and rushed to the crime site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There she saw his (sic) son <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> lying prostrate on the ground with the three accused
still holding the bladed weapons dripping with blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>
was heard uttering a challenge saying who else still is brave man companion of <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>’ (pp. 27-28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 15, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, Alfredo and <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> went towards the direction of the police
precinct while Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. ran eastward
towards the <st1:place><st1:placename>Ryan</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Cinema</st1:placename></st1:place>
(p. 28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 15, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The mother of the victim embraced and pulled her son up but both of
them fell down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She screamed for
help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her nephew and cousin responded
and brought <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Aparri</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where the victim was
treated by a certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Macria</span> <span class="SpellE">Ayuyang</span>
(pp. 28, 29, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1985</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> died after then (sic)
minutes from arrival due to loss of blood (PP. 3-8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Aug. 12, 1985).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> de Rivera, Municipal Health
Officer of <span class="SpellE">Aparri</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of the victim and submitted his
medico-legal necropsy report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H) containing the
following findings, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>'1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>stabbed wound - 4.0 cm. x 1.5 cm x 11.0

<blockquote>CAUSE OF DEATH: shock secondary to hemorrhage due to multiple
stabbed wounds.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of the foregoing happenings, the Assistant Provincial
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, after due preliminary
investigation, filed the corresponding Information for murder against the three
accused-appellants with the Regional Trial Court."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>,
while admitting having inflicted injuries upon the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Desor</span>, insisted that he acted in legitimate defense
of his brother when he inflicted the mortal wounds which resulted in the death
of the said <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His version of the incident is summarized by

telling him 'do not ‘do that <span class="SpellE">manong</span> we are but one.' <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> answered 'even all of you.' When <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>
partly unsheathed his knife he stabbed him several times with a big bolo (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘5'-defense, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>, upon the other hand, denied having stabbed the
deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He claimed that while he was on his way home,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="6">4 June 1984</st1:date>, he
was suddenly boxed on his right cheek by <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He just cried
and went away because <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>
was bigger than he and was the recognized "kingpin" of the
neighborhood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Desor</span> followed and boxed him several times on the
chest causing him to fall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he fell,
<span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> went astride
him and sat on his belly, and then held his neck, choking him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, he lost consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he regained consciousness, he saw his
brother, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>, jumping out from the
window of their house and coming to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alfredo then stabbed <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> with a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After a while, Pat. de la Cruz of the local police arrived at the scene

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>,
Jr. also denied having stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> and interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared that at about <st1:time minute="20" hour="12">12:20 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="6">4 June 1984</st1:date>, he went to see a movie at

<p class="BODY">His testimony was corroborated by Ferdinand <span class="SpellE">Ugale</span>
who declared that he and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. went to
see a movie at the Ryan Cinema at about 12:30 o'clock in the afternoon of 4
June 1984; and that while they were watching a movie, the name of Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. was flashed on the screen as "wanted

<p class="BODY">In support of their appeal, the defendants-appellants claim that
the trial court erred: (1) in not holding that the accused Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> killed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Desor</span> in defense of his relative; (2) in not holding
that <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> and
Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. had no participation in the killing
of the said <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>;
and (3) in sentencing the accused <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The appellants first
claim that the trial court seriously erred in finding that unlawful aggression
was not present in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue
that there was unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased because the
latter was strangulating <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>
when he was stabbed by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the evidence, however, fails to lend credence to the
appellants' claim that there was unlawful aggression on the part of the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lory</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> categorically stated that the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> and the appellant <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> were laughing
and joking as they were grappling for the possession of the basket of crabs
which <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span> wanted
to get from <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For unlawful aggression to be present, there
must be a real danger to life or personal safety.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, there was no danger to the life of <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> as they (<span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>) were in a frolicsome mood.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it would appear that the deceased was unarmed at the
time and sustained five (5) stab wounds in different parts of his body.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which indicates that the act (stabbing) was not in defense of a relative but a
determined effort to kill the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would also appear that when Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>
voluntarily surrendered to the police, he did not inform the latter that he
killed the deceased in order to protect the life of his brother <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He merely
said that he accidentally injured one <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As stated by the Court in one case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
"if he had really acted in self-defense, the probability is that he would
have immediately informed the authorities of that fact if only to minimize his
guilt if not to exculpate himself."</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>We also find no merit in
the claims of the appellants <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr.
that they did not participate in the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> positively identified the said appellants as among
those who stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span> <span class="SpellE">Desor</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> could not have
been mistaken in her identification of the appellants (<span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
and Victor) as perpetrators of the crime because she was near them and the
protagonists were her immediate neighbors in the community.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the trial court found that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> "is
replete with self-contradiction - a mark of <span class="SpellE">untruthf</span> <span class="SpellE">ulness</span> and incredulousness"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

and we find nothing in the record which would justify our setting aside said
finding.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the alibi of Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr.
that he was inside the Ryan Cinema at the time of the commission of the crime,
suffice it to state that the said <span class="SpellE">moviehouse</span> is only
about 100 to 150 meters away from the scene of the crime and the said appellant
has not shown that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of
the crime at the time it was committed. Besides, his alibi cannot prevail over
his positive identification by <span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants
claim that the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
imposed by the trial court upon the appellants <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>,
Jr. is excessive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellants argue that
with the elimination of the death penalty in the 1987 Constitution, the penalty
for Murder was accordingly reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This issue had been laid to rest in the case of People vs. Munoz,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

where the Court ruled that Article III. Section 19(1) of the 1987 Constitution
does not change the periods of the penalty prescribed by Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code except that it prohibits the imposition of the death penalty
and reduces it to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court therein further ruled that the
range of the medium and minimum penalties for murder remains unchanged.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, however, that <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr.
are only accomplices in the crime since their participations therein were not
absolutely indispensable in the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lory</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunabon</span> declared that <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> stabbed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Joemar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Desor</span> after Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>
had stabbed the deceased at the back, while Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>,
Jr. stabbed the said deceased while the latter was already lying prostrate on
the ground.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

While the acts of <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>
and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr. show a community of design
with the principal, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span>, who inflicted
the fatal wound, and they (<span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> and Victor)
cooperated in hastening the victim's death, the said appellants' acts were not
absolutely indispensable in the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A person who assaults a victim already
fatally wounded by another, is only regarded as an accomplice.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The penalty for appellants <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagalingan</span> and Victor <span class="SpellE">Romina</span>, Jr.
as accomplices must be modified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
are hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate penalty of from eight (8) years
and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>, as
