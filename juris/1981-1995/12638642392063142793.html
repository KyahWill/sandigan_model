"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Inc. vs. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue," which set aside the petitioner Revenue Commissioner's
assessment of P1,151,146.98 as the 25% surtax on the private respondent's
unreasonable accumulation of surplus for the years 1975-1978.</p>

demanded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it protested the
assessment on <span class="GramE">a 25</span>% surtax on the third item on the
ground that the accumulation of surplus profits during the years in question
was solely for the purpose of expanding its business operations as real estate
broker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The request for reinvestigation
was granted on condition that a w</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">ai</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ver of the statute of limitations should </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>The latter replied that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">there
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was no need of a waiver of the
statute of limitations because the right of the Government to assess said tax

that portions of the tax liabilities involved in the assessment had already <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">been </span>paid, a writ of injunction was
issued by the Tax Court on November 26, 1984, ordering the Commissioner to
refrain from enforcing said warrants of <span class="SpellE">distraint</span> and
levy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not require the petitioner
to file a bond (Annex A, pp. 28-30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the reversal of the Commissioner's decision by the Court
of Tax Appeals, the petitioner appealed to this Court, raising the following
issues:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition for review
is meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Tax Appeals
conceded that the Revenue Commissioner's determination that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Inc. was a mere holding or investment company, was
"presumptively correct" (p. 7, </span>Annex <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">A), for the corporation did not involve itself </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the development of subdivisions but merely
subdivided its own lots and sold them for bigger profits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It derived its income mostly from interest,
dividends and rental realized from the sale of realty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Another circumstance
supporting that presumption is that 99.99% in value of the outstanding stock of
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Inc., is owned by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Commissioner "conclusively presumed" that when the corporation
accumulated </span>(instead of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">distributing
to the shareholders) a surplus </span>of over P3 million <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from its earnings in 1975 to 1978, the
purpose was to avoid the imposition of the progressive income tax </span>on its
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shareholders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">That Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">lnc</span>. <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">accumulated</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> surplus profits amounting to P3,263,305.88
for 1975 up to 1978 is not disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the private respondent vehemently denies that its purpose was
to evade payment of </span>the progressive income tax <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">on such dividends by </span>its stockholders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondent, surplus profits were set </span>aside
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by the company to build up sufficient
capital for its expansion program which included the construction in 1979-1981
of an apartment building, and the purchase in 1980 of a condominium unit which
was intended for resale or </span>lease.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">However, while these
investments were actually </span>made, the Commissioner points out that the
corporation did not use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">up its surplus
profits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its allegation that P1<span class="GramE">,525,672.74</span> was spent for the construction of an apartment

shows that its market value is only P429,890.00, and the Tax Declaration on the
condominium unit which reflects a market value of P293,830.00 only </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">D-1).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The
enormous discrepancy between the alleged investment cost and the declared
market value of these pieces of real </span>estate was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">not denied nor explained by the private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Since </span>the company
as of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">time </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the assessment </span>in 1981, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">had invested in its </span>business <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">operations only P773,720 </span>out of its
accumulated surplus profits of P3,263,305.88 for 1975-1978, its remaining
accumulated surplus profits of P2,489,585.88 are subject to the 25% surtax.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">All presumptions are in
favor of the correctness of petitioner's assessment against the private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is incumbent upon
the taxpayer to prove the contrary (Mindanao Bus Company vs. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, 1 SCRA 538).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the private respondent failed to overcome the presumption
of correctness <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">of </span>the
Commissioner's assessment.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The touchstone of liability <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">is </span>the purpose behind the accumulation of the income and not the
consequences of the accumulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
if the failure to pay dividends were for the purpose of using the undistributed
earnings and profits for the reasonable needs of the business, that purpose
would not fall within the interdiction of the statute" (<span class="SpellE">Mertens</span> Law of Federal Income Taxation, Vol. 7, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Chapter 39, p. 45 cited in Manila Wine

483, 493).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">plain </span>to see
that the company's failure to distribute dividends to its stockholders in
1975-1978 was for reasons other than the reasonable needs of the business,
thereby falling within the interdiction of Section 25 of the Tax Code of 1977.</p>
