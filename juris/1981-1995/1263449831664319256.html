<p class="BODY">"<u>Antecedents</u>:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In Administrative Matter No. 4453-CFI, the Court's majority through its
resolution of December 28, 1979 upheld the order of Executive Judge Gregorio G.
Pineda denying the motion of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, Jr. for inhibition from further hearing the
anti-graft case against former Land Registration Commissioner Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>, Jr., et al., docketed as Criminal Case No. 27743 of
the Court of First Instance, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>. Chief Justice Fernando, Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera
and I dissented and voted to grant the Motion for inhibition for the reasons
stated in the Resolution, copy of which is attached hereto as Annex 'A' for
ready reference and for a full statement of the antecedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">“Chief Justice Fernando's vote is herewith reproduced for the
Court's considerations: 'Chief Justice Fernando voted to grant such motion
consis­tently with the principle he has followed invariably in a number of
opinions penned by him that to avoid any suspicion as to the absence of that
desir­able frame of mind expected of a judge, namely the cold neutrality of an
impartial arbiter, and considering the incidents that show the apparent lack of
mutual goodwill between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> and
respondent Judge, the latter's apparent willingness to leave the disposition of
the matter to the Court gives more than ample ground for his inhibition and the
re-raffling of the case.'</p>

<p class="BODY">"On <span style="">my part, </span>I
urged the members of the Court to consider that under our unbroken line of
doctrinal jurisprudence, elementary due process which entitles every litigant
to the cold neutrality of an impartial judge demands the inhibition of the
judge. Where there exist <u>mutual mistrust</u>, <u>suspicion and hostility</u>
between the complainant and the judge, with the complainant charging in open
hearing before this Court that the judge offered <u>him for sale</u> a land
suspected of being covered by a <u>void title</u> and with the judge likewise
charging the complainant <u>in open hearing</u> with having <u>halluci­nations</u>
and having tried to <u>bribe and corrupt him</u>, and acknowledging com­plainant's
fear that 'the accused will be acquitted in my court,' the judge should
withdraw from the case, He has passed the buck to us and we must tell him so.”</p>

<p class="BODY">"Likewise, let it be recalled that the record before us
shows that there is a strained relationship between <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
and Judge Pineda and more, mutual hostility, mistrust and prejudice, with <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> expressing open mistrust of the judge who offered
him for sale a land suspected of being covered by wrongfully issued titles and
the judge openly charging <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> of having
hallucinations and trying to bribe him, and asserting that <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
'is full of fear and suspicion in his mind' and fears that 'the accused will
finally be acquitted in <span style="">my </span>court
. . . Because he could not corrupt me, that is how he is hallucinating before
this Honorable Tribunal.' This makes it imperative for this Court to heed Judge
Pineda's request for guidance in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part
of his order (stating that he is 'amenable to whatever this Honorable Supreme
Court may decide on the matter') and accordingly, to dec­lare that it is in the
best interests of justice, in accordance with our settled doctrines and
jurisprudence, that the case below be transferred and re-raffled among the
other branches of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The land suspected <span style="">of
</span>being covered by a void title therein referred to and purportedly
belonging to respondent judge's aunt (see transcript of hearing reproduced on
pages <span style="">15 to 17 </span>hereof) has now
definitively and finally held by this Court to be covered by a fake claim and
title in <u><span style="">Director of Lands vs. CA</span></u><span style="">, </span>L-45168, Resolution of <u><span style="">September 25, 1979</span></u><span style=""> </span>and Decision of <u>January 27, 1981</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">"<u>The
present case</u>.</span></span><span style=""> - </span>At
any rate, as a consequence of the attached Resolution, Judge Pineda continued
the trial and hearing of the case. But according to the petition, Judge Pineda
continued to show undue interest and partiality in the trial of the case,
obviously favoring the accused, which prompted the government prosecutors, <span class="SpellE">Linco</span> and Guerrero, to file on <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1980</st1:date> before the respondent judge a
motion for his disqualifi­cation and/or inhibition of respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">"At the hearing of <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1980</st1:date>, the motion was ordered stricken off the record on the
flimsy ground that it was mistakenly captioned "Office of the Provincial
Fiscal" instead of "Court of First Instance." The next day, or
on <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioners <span class="SpellE">refiled</span> their Motion for Disqualification
and/or Inhibition of respondent judge, this time properly captioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Respondent Judge denied the motion for inhibition and
continued with the trial of the case. What precipitated the filing of this peti­tion
is, while the prosecution was still in the process of presenting rebuttal
evidence, respondent judge terminated the case and verbally ordered petitioner <span class="SpellE">Linco</span> to submit memorandum on the case within ten (10) days
although the verbal order was modified in respondent judge's written order of
January 12, 1981 by requiring petitioners to submit their formal offer of
rebuttal evidence within ten (10) days and to submit their memorandum within
thirty (30) days. Petitioners allege that respondent judge committed grave
abuse of discretion by arbi­trarily, whimsically and capriciously closing the
case without allowing the State, represented by the herein petitioners, to
finish or complete its rebuttal evidence, a matter which, besides being
contrary to law is an obvious display of bias, hostility, and partiality. Peti­tioners
pointed out that respondent judge committed error of law and gravely abused his
discretion in compelling petitioner Guerrero to be placed on the witness stand
and cross-examined in the hearing of their motion for inhibition and finding them
in contempt while denying their mo­tion to hold counsel for accused <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span> in contempt of court. They likewise reiterated their
previous stand that respondent judge committed error of law and grave abuse of
discretion in refusing to inhibit <span class="GramE">himself</span> from try­ing
the criminal case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"I. </span>Petitioners
allege that respondent judge committed grave abuse of discretion in refusing to
inhibit <span class="GramE">himself</span> from trying Criminal Case No. 27743
against the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">“In view of the antecedents clearly demonstrating the antagonism
between the complainant and respondent judge (Adm. Matter No. 4453 CFI) or at
the very least, on the basis of the evident lack of faith on the part of the
complainant and prosecution with respect to the ability of the respondent judge
to dispense justice without bias or partiality, the respondent judge should
have voluntarily inhibited himself if only to restore the confidence of the
complainant and prosecution <span style="">in </span>particular
and the public in general in the soundness of our judicial system and the
integrity and probity of those who sit in the bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Again, in view of the verbal clashes between the
prosecution and the respondent judge and the charges of partiality <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> by the prosecution, considering that 'however
upright the judge, and however free from the slightest inclination to do
justice, there is peril of his unconscious bias or prejudice’ (Del Castillo vs.
<span class="SpellE">Javelona</span>, 6 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 146 cited
in Ignacio vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, 90 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
16) engendered by the expres­sed antagonism or at the very least, a
demonstration of lack of confi­dence on the part of both the prosecution and
its complaining witness. Thus, in <u>Pimentel vs. <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span></u>,
21 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 160, <span class="GramE">We</span> held that:</p>

<blockquote>'All the foregoing notwithstanding, this should be a good occasion
as any to draw attention of all judges to appropriate guidelines in a situation
where their capacity to try and decide a case fairly and judiciously comes to
the fore by way of challenge from any one of the parties. A judge may not be
legally prohibited from sitting in <span class="GramE">a litigation</span>. But
when suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in favor of
one party or with bias or pre­judice against a litigant arising out of
circumstances reasonably capable of inciting such a state of mind, he should
conduct a careful self-examination. He should exercise his discretion in a way
that the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired. A salutary
norm is that he <span class="GramE">reflect</span> on the probability that a
losing party might nurture at the back of his mind the thought that the judge
had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> tilted the scales of justice
against him. That passion on the part of a judge may be generated because of
serious charges of misconduct against him by a suitor or his counsel is not
altogether remote. He is a man, subject to the frailties of other men. He
should, therefore, exercise great care and caution before making up his mind to
act or withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel is involved. He could
in good grace inhibit himself where that case could be heard <span style="">by </span>another judge and where no
appreciable prejudice would be occasioned to others involved therein. On the
result of his decisions to sit or not to sit may depend to a great extent the
all-important confidence in the impartiality of the judi­ciary. If after
reflection he should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where
his motives or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be
interpreted as giving meaning and substance to the second paragraph of Section
1, Rule 137. He serves the cause of the law who forestalls miscarriage of
justice.’</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Judges should not only be impartial, but should also appear
impartial. (Fernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Presbitero</span>, 79 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 61.) While judges should possess proficiency in law in
order that they can competently construe and enforce the law, it is more
important that they should act and behave in such a manner that the parties
before them should have confidence in their impartiality (Ibid). It is now
beyond dispute that due process cannot be satisfied in the absence of that
degree of objectivity on the part of a judge sufficient to reassure litigants
of his being fair and just (Mateo, Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, 50
<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 18).</p>

<p class="BODY">"It has been said, in fact, that due process of law requires
a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal and that every
litigant is entitled to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial
judge (Gutierrez vs. Santos, 2 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 249, <span class="SpellE">Villapando</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Quitain</span>, 75 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 24).</p>

<p class="BODY">“In <u>Castillo vs. Juan,</u> 62 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
124, We held that in the event that a judge may be unable to discern for
himself his inability to meet the test of the cold neutrality required of him,
this Court has seen to it that he should disqualify himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">“2<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While</span>
on its face, the obvious attempt of the respondent judge to terminate the
proceedings with apparent speed and dispatch should merit our approval and
commendation, his failure to accord the same consideration to other cases
pending before his <span class="SpellE">sala</span> including cases involving
detention prisoners, must necessarily give rise to doubts as to his reasons for
pursuing this particular case with a vigor unknown in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.
Where the deportment <span style="">of </span>a judge
leaves much to be desired, he should be disqualified. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Villapando</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Quitain</span>, supra.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span style="">&nbsp;</span>The refusal of respondent judge to grant
the prosecution ample opportunity to complete its rebuttal evidence.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">"In the first place, postponements are part and parcel of
our procedural <span class="GramE">system</span> of dispensing justice, and when
substantial rights are affe<span style="">c</span>te<span style="">d</span> and the intention to delay<span style=""> </span>is not manifest, it is sound judi­cial
discretion to allow them. (<span class="SpellE">Rexwell</span> Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, 3 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 875.) In
considering motions of postponement of trials or for new tr<span style="">i</span>als, two circumstances should be
taken into account by the court, namely (1) the merits of the case of the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>, and (2) the reasonableness of the postponement or
new trials (De Cases vs. <span class="SpellE">Peyer</span> 5 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
1165; <span class="SpellE">Udan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Amon</span>, 23 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 837).</p>

<p class="BODY">"In the second place, the right to speedy trial is not
violated by granting a continuance on the ground of the absence of material
witnesses (<span class="SpellE">Rexwell</span> Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">"In the third place, there will have been no substantial
injury or prejudice upon the accused <span style="">by
</span>a delay of one or two months considering <span style="">that all the accused are out on bail. The interests of justice and fair
play will better be served if greater freedom and latitude is allowed the
parties to present, for the consideration and appreciation of the court, all
their evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">"In any event, the
State is likewise entitled to due process </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">criminal cases, thus
We held in the case of </span><u>People vs. Navarro</u>, <span style="">63 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 264 and the
later case of </span><u>Silvestre vs. Military </u><u><span style="">Commission</span></u><span style=""> No. 21,
82 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 10, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'The State is entitled to due process in criminal cases, that is,
it must be given the opportunity to present its evidence in support of the
charge. The Court has always accorded this right to the prosecution, and where
the right had been denied, had promptly annulled the offending court action. We
have heretofore held that a purely capricious dismissal of an information
deprives the State of fair opportunity to prosecute and convict; it denies the
prosecution its day in court. For this reason, it is a dismissal (in reality an
acquittal) without due process, and, therefore, null and void. Such dismissal
is invalid for lack of a fundamental prerequisite, that is, due process, and,
consequently, will not constitute a proper basis for the claim of double jeopardy.
We have likewise held that a trial court may not arbitrarily deny a timely and
well-founded motion of the prosecution for reconsi­deration of an order of
dismissal or acquittal and that such arbitrary refusal to reopen the case will
be set aside to give the State its day in court and an opportunity to prove the
offense charged against the accused and to prevent mis­carriage of justice,
especially when no substantial right of the accused would be prejudiced
thereby.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Petitioners contend that respondent judge
committed grave abuse of discretion in compelling Fiscal Guerrero to take the
witness stand and be cross-examined on his motion for inhibition. Section 2,
Rule 137 of the Rules of Court provides for the procedure to be followed in
objecting to the competency of the judge in hearing a case, which must be
substantially followed (Joaquin vs. <span class="SpellE">Barreto</span>, 25 Phil.
281). Objection to the competency of the judge should be filed with him in
writing and the judge shall determine his qualification (Government of
Philippine Islands vs. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Abella</span>, 49 Phil. 374)
and thereupon proceed with the trial or to withdraw <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
in accordance with his determination of the question of his disqualification.
The judge is not allowed by the rules to receive evidence on the motion for
inhibition. Though not necessarily il­legal or improper, it is not a usual
procedure in the conduct of trial to place a prosecutor on the witness stand
and put pressure on the prosecu­tion which might be construed as indicative of
personal bias or interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hostility of respondent judge against
petitioners is bols­tered by the fact that, in his order of <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1981</st1:date>, he declared peti­tioners
in contempt of court and fined P100.00 each because of alleged false
manifestations made before the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">"It appears that petitioners were ordered by the respondent
judge to submit to the court the names of their rebuttal witnesses and the
nature of their testimony. In their manifestation of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1980</st1:date>, they refused on the ground that
they did not want to divulge the names of their witnesses because of their fear
that the witnesses, who are em­ployees of the Land Registration <span class="GramE">Commission</span> might be influenced by their former superiors,
the accused. They cited Acting Land Registration Com­missioner Federico B.
Alfonso, Jr., who cautioned them to exercise res­traint and reminded them that
the accused are capable of intimidating witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Based on a letter of Acting Commissioner Alfonso,
respondent judge in his January 7, 1981 Order (Annex 'EE') declared petitioners
guilty of contempt of court for allegedly making 'false imputations as found by
(his) court, thereby obstructing, delaying and fomenting distrust in the
administration of justice.' In fact, respondent judge plainly misinterpreted the
letter of Acting Commissioner Alfonso as a complete denial of the statement
attributed to him. Respondent judge lost sight of the fact that in his
typewritten letter, Acting Commissioner Alfonso add­ed in his own handwriting
the statement, 'I do not pass judgment on the capability or lack of capability
of accused to intimidate witnesses' which is not a denial that he did express
the fear to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The act of respondent judge declaring
petitioners-prosecutors guilty of 'reprehensible and contemptuous .... gross
misconduct' on a contentious and insignificant matter manifests clear
partiality and hostility against the prosecution that require his
disqualification, considering the antecedents as set forth above and in Annex
'A' hereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The Court's <u><span style="">settled
and uniform jurisprudence</span></u><span style=""> </span>on
the litigants' right to the <u><span style="">cold
neutrality of an impartial judge</span></u><span style=""> </span>as an essential part of due process demand such
disqualification - until and unless the Court is to overthrow its long line of
decisions which form part of the law of the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The only drawback cited that it is better that the judge
who tried the case, hand down the decision, must yield to the law of the land.
And it is refuted by the numerous cases decided correctly by judges other than
those who tried the same and saw and heard the witnesses, more so, where as in
this case, the main evidence consists of documentary evidence.</p>

Judge Gregorio G. Pineda, CFI, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Branch XXI. - The Court voted to sustain the order of Executive Judge Gregorio
G. Pineda, denying for lack of merit the mo­tion of <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, Jr. for the inhibition of Executive Judge
Gregorio G. Pineda from further hearing Criminal Case No. 27743 entitled
'People vs. Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>, Jr., et al.’ Chief
Justice Fernando and Justices <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera voted to grant the motion for inhibition.
Justices Felix V. <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span> and Felix Q. Antonio
reserved their votes. Chief Justice Fernando voted to grant such mo­tion
consistently with the principle he has followed invariably in a number of
opinions penned by him that to avoid any sus­picion as to the absence of that
desirable frame of mind ex­pected of a judge, namely, the cold neutrality of an
impartial arbiter, and considering the incidents that show the apparent lack of
mutual goodwill between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> and respon­dent
Judge, the latter's apparent willingness to leave the disposition of the matter
to the Court gives more than ample ground for his inhibition and the
re-raffling of the case. Jus­tice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>,
dissenting, voted to (a) direct the implemen­tation by the Ministry of Justice
of the President's order of January 12, 1979 to transfer the case below to the <span class="SpellE">Sandigan­bayan</span> or to secure a revocation of the same within
fifteen (15) days from notice hereof; and (b) in the event that such revo­cation
is obtained within the said fifteen-day period, to direct that the case below
be transferred and re-raffled among the other branches of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (ex­cluding Branch XXI presided by
Judge Pineda and the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>)
upon due notice to and in the presence of the parties, including complainant <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, and/or their res­pective counsels. Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera concurred with the above dissent. Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee's</span> separate opinion fol­lows:</blockquote>

before Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
of the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> who had
already held eight months of extensive hearings, had filed <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> on <u>their</u> <u>own</u> behalf an obviously
pre-prepared pe­tition of five (5) short paragraphs, stating that Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> had filed a leave of absence from August 20, 1978
to September 21, 1978 (the specific dates were just filled in ink on the blank
spaces provided in the petition, indicating that the accused who were <u>at-large</u>
already had a prepared petition for re-raffle ready for them to <u>come out of
hiding</u> and to file the same upon Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>'
going on leave of absence), that they had not yet been arraigned, that their
bail bonds had not been approved due to Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>'
absence and they were liable to be arrested any time and that they invoked
their right to speedy trial, and prayed that the case be referred to the
Executive Judge of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for re-raffle.</blockquote>

included in the <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1976</st1:date>
agenda of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> (with a heavy load of 108 items), at which
time <span style="">there were </span>only sixteen
days left yet of Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>' leave of ab­sence. <span style="">Upon </span>recommendation of the Court's
then executive officer, now deputy <span style="">court
</span>administrator Arturo B. Buena (who was apparently <span style="">by the misrepresentations </span>and was
unaware that the reason for the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>’
non-arraignment was that they had gone into hiding and had evaded service of the
warrants <span style="">of arrest long issued </span>against
them), the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in its session of September 5 granted
the petition without following the usual practice of requiring the
prosecution's comment and thus the case was re-raffled and re-docketed as Cri­minal
Case No. 27743 of the <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> CFI presided by Executive
Judge Gregorio G. Pineda.”</blockquote>

transfer of the case from the circuit criminal court to the court of first

January 12, 1979 in a directive to the Ministry of Justice "ordered the

cases from one branch to another which falls within the exclusive jurisdiction
of this Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>- <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> expressed his "full and
unqualified belief in the wis­dom and integrity of the Supreme Court" and
averred that through their misrepresentations the three above-named co-accused

September 5, granting the petition for the transfer of the case from the
circuit criminal court to the court of first instance.</blockquote>

expressed great suspicion as to the re-raffling of the case and its falling in
the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge Pineda, so much so that some Justices
suggested that his remedy was to file a motion for the inhibition of Judge
Pineda and to state the reasons as he did in open court why he "did not
have faith in the court of Judge Pineda" and "doubted his fairness"
although expressing that he had "enough ground for my fear but not enough
for his disqualification." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">T.s.n</span>.

<blockquote>- In answer to a question of Mr. Justice
De Castro, <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> explained his misgivings as to the
whitewashing of the case against <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span> in the
Ministry of Justice in this wise: "(B<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ecause</span></span> of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Bilog's</span>
boast in the past that he is well covered in the Department of justice, in the

and hostility <span style="">between <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> and Judge Pineda may best </span>be appreciated from
the transcript of the last part of <span style="">the </span>hearing
wherein <span style="">both of them expressed </span>their
respective feelings <span style="">against each </span>other

your </span>charges <span style="">before the Pre­sident
</span>while you cannot substantiate <span style="">it
</span>before <span style="">the Court, </span>you

shows that there is a strained relationship<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>between <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
and Judge Pineda and <span style="">mo</span>re, mutual
hostility, mistrust and prejudice, with <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>
expressing open mistrust of the judge who offered him for sale a land suspected
of being covered by <span style="">wrongfully </span>issued
titles and the judge openly charging <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span> of having
hallucinations and trying to bribe him, and asserting that <span class="SpellE">Sy­juco</span>
‘is full of fear and suspicion in his mind' and fears that ‘the ac­cused will
finally be acquitted in my court ... Because he could not corrupt me, that is
how he is hallucinating before this Honorable Tri­bunal.' This makes it
imperative for this Court to heed Judge Pineda's request for guidance in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of his order (stating that he is
"amenable to whatever this Honorable Supreme Court may decide on the
matter") and accordingly, to declare that it is in the best interests of
justice, in accordance with our settled doctrines and juris­prudence, that the
case below be transferred and re-raffled among the other branches of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (excluding Judge Pineda's
branch and the Circuit Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) upon
due no­tice to and in the presence of the parties, including complainant <span class="SpellE">Syjuco</span>, and/or their respective counsels.</p>

<blockquote>"We have said time and again that all suitors are 'entitled to
nothing short of the cold neutrality of an independent, wholly free,
disinterested and impartial tribunal' (<span class="SpellE"><u>Luque</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Kayanan</span></u>, 29 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
175-177).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <u>Pimentel vs. <span class="SpellE">Salanga</span></u>, 21 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 160, we said that ‘if after reflection, he (the judge)
should resolve to voluntarily desist from sitting in a case where his motives
or fairness might be seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as
giving meaning and sub­stance to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137,’
and laid down the following appropriate guidelines for judges to follow in the
matter of their inhibition.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'All the foregoing notwithstanding, this should be a good occasion
as any to draw attention of all judges to appropriate guidelines in a situation
where their capacity to try and decide a case fairly and judiciously comes to
the fore by way of challenge from any one of the parties. A judge may not be
legally prohibited from sitting in <span class="GramE">a litigation</span>. But
when suggestion is made of record that he might be induced to act in favor of
one party or <u>with bias or prejudice</u> against a litigant arising out of
circumstances <u>reasonably</u> capable of inciting such a state of mind, he
should conduct a careful self-examination. He should exercise his discretion in
a way that <u>the people's faith in the courts of justice is not impaired</u>.
A salutary norm is that he <span class="GramE">reflect</span> on the probability
that a losing party might nurture at the back of his mind the thought that the
judge had <span class="SpellE">unmeritoriously</span> <u>tilted</u> the scales of
justice against him. That passion on the part of a judge may be generated
because of <u>serious charges of misconduct</u> against him by a suitor or his
counsel is not altogether remote. He is a man, subject to the frailties of
other men. He should, therefore, exercise <u>great care and caution</u> before
making up his mind to act or withdraw from a suit where that party or counsel
is involved. <u>He could in good grace inhibit himself where that case could be
heard by another judge and where no appreciable prejudice would be occasioned
to others involved therein</u>. On the result of his decisions to sit or not to
sit may depend to a great extent the <u>all-important confidence in the
impartiality of the judiciary</u>. If after reflection he should resolve to <u>voluntarily
desist</u> from sitting in a case where his motives or fairness might he
seriously impugned, his action is to be interpreted as giving meaning and
substance to the second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137. <u>He serves the
cause of the law who forestalls miscarriage of justice</u>.' (<span class="GramE">emphasis</span> supplied).</p>

<blockquote>"Now Chief Justice Fernando has stressed that 'It is now
beyond dispute that <u>due process cannot be satisfied</u> in the absence of
that <u>degree of objectivity</u> on the part of a judge sufficient to <u>reassure
litigants of his being fair and being just</u>. Thereby there is the legiti­mate
expectation that the decision arrived at would be the application of the law to
the facts as found by a judge who does not play favorites. For him, the parties
stand on equal footing. In the language of Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>:
'It has been said, in fact, that due process of law requires a hearing before
an impartial and disinterested tribunal, and that every <u>litigant is entitled
to nothing less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge</u>.' x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> A judge then, to quote from
the latest decision in point, <span class="SpellE"><u>Geotina</u></span><u> vs.
Gonzales</u>, penned by Justice Castro, should strive to be at all times
'wholly free, disinterested, impartial and independent. <u>Elementary due
process</u> requires a hearing before an impartial and disinterested tribunal.
A judge has both the duty of rendering a just decision and the duty of doing it
<u>in a manner completely free from suspicion as to its fairness and as to his
integrity</u>.' (<u>Mateo vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span></u>, 50 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In <u>Ignacio vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span></u>,
L-37527-52, <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1979</st1:date>, the
Chief Justice again reiterated the principle that "<span class="GramE">It</span>
is now beyond dispute <span style="">that </span><u>due
process</u> cannot be satisfied in the absence of that <u>degree of objectivity</u>
on the part of a judge sufficient to <u>reassure litigants</u> of his being
fair and just.' <span class="GramE">(Ibid, 23.)</span> It is traceable to <u>Gutierrez
vs. Santos</u> (112 Phil. 184), a 1961 decision, cited in the petition. As a
matter of fact, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Umale</u></span>, five cases were
relied upon in support of the c<span style="">onclusion
</span>reached, starting from <u>Del Castillo vs. <span class="SpellE">Javelona</span></u>
(116 Phil. 451 [1962]), likewise invoked by petitioner and referred to in the
Comment of the Solicitor General. Such a doctrine has been consistently adhered
to (Cf. <span class="SpellE"><u>Umale</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span></u>,
L-23710, Sept. 10, 1969, 29 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 688, and other cases
cited), the latest case in point being <u>Bautista vs. <span class="SpellE">Rebueno</span></u>
(L-46117, Feb. 22, 1978, 81 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 535),"
remarking that 'it is difficult to understand the reluctance of respondent
judge to inhibit himself’.</blockquote>

Judge did not commit any error nor grave abuse of discretion in allowing the
cross-examination of petitioner Guerrero at the hearing of subject motion for
inhibition. It appears that said motion for disqualification was set for
hearing at the instance of the petitioners (pp. 4-5 of said Motion for
Disqualification); in the hearing of said motion on September 19, 1980,
petitioner Guerrero presented evidence in nar­rative form and at the next
hearing on October 1, 1980, submitted him­self to cross-examination by the
defense counsel without objection through 102 pages of the transcript of
stenographic notes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex 'P',
pet.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only at the next hearing
of <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1980</st1:date>, for the
continuation of said cross-examination that he objected; but there is nothing
in the re­cord that respondent judge threatened him with contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner Guerrero not only made
manifestations as a prosecutor but actually testi­fied as a witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Annex 'P', petition).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his cross-examination by defense

<p class="BODY">“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge did not err in declaring
petitioners in contempt of court and in denying the motion to hold Atty. <span class="SpellE">Exequiel</span> <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span> in contempt of

filed against the petitioners: (a) one was filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>,
counsel for accused <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span> for having falsely
represented in court that 'Acting Commissioner of Land Registration Federico B.
Alfonso, Jr. had expressed the belief that the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>, Jr. is capable of intimidating witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting Commissioner Alfonso both in open
court and in his letter dated August 22, 1980 categorically denied the
imputations attributed to him; (b) the other motion was filed by accused <span class="SpellE">Felino</span> Cortez on the ground that they filed a Motion for
Disqualification dated August 28, 1980, of the respondent judge, alleging
imputations of partiality and bias on the part of the respondent judge, which
the court in the Order dated January 7, 1981 (Annex 'EE', petition) found to be
false.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners filed a mo­tion
for contempt against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span> for alleged
distortion of the meaning of their allegation in their Manifestation of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1980</st1:date>, which does not refer
to Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>, Jr. alone but to the 'accused' and
to <span class="SpellE">Bilog's</span> well entrenched friends at the Land
Registration Commis­sion, as capable of intimidating witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Motion to Hold Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>
in Contempt of Court; Annex 'N', petition).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent judge rendered the Order dated January 7, 1981 (Annex 'EE',
id.), finding petitioners guilty of contempt of court, sentencing each of them
to pay a fine of P100.00 with a warning that repetition of the same or similar
acts shall be dealt with severely. The motion to hold Atty. <span class="SpellE">Consulta</span>
in contempt was denied for lack of merit. According to respondent judge, it is
immaterial whether the imputation refers to <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>
alone or to all the accused (including <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span>), the issue
being the falsity of the prosecu­tors' claim that Acting <span class="SpellE">LRC</span>
Commissioner made such imputation.</p>

<p class="BODY">"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge did not err in denying

prosecution's rebuttal evidence, for giving prosecution 10 days within which to

petitioner <span class="SpellE">Linco</span> again asked for postponement on t<span style="">he </span>ground that the last witness she was
going to present could not be located because he had resigned from the <span class="SpellE">LRC</span>, and on the further ground that they intended to appeal
certain orders of the respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for <span class="SpellE">Bilog</span> vigorously objected to the
motion for postponement and asked that since the prosecution had no witness the
rebuttal evidence be deemed terminated and the case submitted for decision,
which was granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Un­doubtedly, trial
courts have the power to regulate the conduct of trials and direct their
course; and may thus limit the number of witnesses when in its opinion further
testimony on the point would be merely cumulative.</p>

testified for the prosecution, was their last witness (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>

the Order terminating their rebuttal evidence could not have prejudiced the
prosecution's case, since the defense did not ask for the striking out of the
testimony of that witness for his failure to appear for additional
cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Hence, I vote to dismiss the petition for lack of
merit."</p>
