<p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the Order of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span> in Civil Case No. 5076<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> entitled "<em>Antonio Buenaventura, 
Plaintiff vs. Geronima</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Halili</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Uy</em></span><em>, et al., Defendants</em>," which dismissed a 
complaint for forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, on appeal 
before it, on the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) to entertain the original 
complaint which was unverified and filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period required under Section 1, Rule 70 of the 
Rules of Court and (b) to order the amendment of said complaint by subsequently 
filing a verified amended complaint.</p>

follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-appellant Antonio Buenaventura by virtue of a written 
contract of lease, leased unto the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Geronima</span> <span class="SpellE">Halili</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and her husband a portion consisting of 144 square meters 
of his residential lot located at Bolton Street, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> 
City, where the latter constructed their residential house.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
consideration is P50.00 a month for a period of twenty five (25) years.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> however, occupied an area of 279 
square meters or 135 square meters in excess of the leased premises.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon discovery of this unauthorized occupancy, appellant notified <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to remove the additional construction on the 
excess portion.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> 
agreed to pay an additional rent of P30.00 a month for the area in question and 
appellant allowed them to occupy the same until the time he would need the 
premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometime later, this need arose and appellant thru 
counsel demanded that <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> vacate the excess 
portion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon refusal to vacate, an action was filed for "forcible 
entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>", before the City Court of 
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> 
City, docketed as Civil Case No. 603-A, entitled "<em>Antonio Buenaventura vs. 
Geronima</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>Halili</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Uy</em></span><em>, et al</em>" (Record on Appeal, pp. 
5-11).</p>
<p class="BODY">Defendants filed a Motion <span class="GramE">To</span> Dismiss on 
the grounds of: <span>&nbsp;</span>(a) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter, 
the complaint not having been verified and the supposed <span>forcible entry 
having taken place almost seventeen (17) years ago and (b) lack of cause of 
action (<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 14-22).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The City Court allowed counsel for plaintiff to amend his 
complaint and the defendants' motion to dismiss was denied 
</span><span>(<span><em>Ibid.</em></span>, </span><span>pp. 
23-24).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint duly 
verified with its caption changed to "<span class="SpellE">Ejectment</span>" but 
the ultimate facts remained materially the same as those in the original 
complaint (<span><em>Ibid.</em></span>, pp. 24-31; Brief for the 
Plaintiff-Appellant, p. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From the evidence presented the City Court rendered a 
decision in favor of the plaintiff; the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> 
portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff 
and against the defendants, sentencing the defendants:</blockquote>

excess portion in question and to restore the possession thereof to the 
plaintiff;</blockquote>

until they vacate the premises; and</blockquote>

costs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Defendants' counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees not having 
been <span class="GramE">substantiated,</span> is hereby dismissed." (Record on 
Appeal, pp. 40-45)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>On appeal, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> sustained the position of counsel for the defendant 
and dismissed the case, (<span><em>Ibid.</em></span>, pp. 69-73) and denied the 
motion for reconsideration of said Order filed by the plaintiff 
(<span><em>Ibid.</em></span>., pp. 129-130).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case which in effect combines the four 
errors assigned is whether or not the suit instituted by the herein 
plaintiff-appellant is a forcible entry or an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Dikit</em></span><em> 
v. Ycasiano</em> (89 Phil. 46-49 [1951]) clearly laid down some distinctions 
between the two actions, as follows:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) As to possession:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>the possession of the intruder or person who deprives another of the 
possession of a land or building in forcible entry is illegal from the beginning 
because his entry into or taking possession thereof is made against the will or 
without the consent of the former possessor; while in unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, the possession of the <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> is originally legal or lawful, but it becomes 
illegal after the expiration or termination of his right to <span>hold 
possession of the land or building by virtue of a contract; (2) As to demand to 
vacate:<span>&nbsp; </span>in forcible entry, no previous demand to vacate is 
required by law before the filing of the action; while in an action for unlawful 
<span class="SpellE">detainer</span> by a landlord against his tenant, such demand 
is required.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Coming back to the case at bar, there is no question that 
the action filed by herein plaintiff-appellant is not one of forcible entry but 
of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For it is clear 
that when appellant asked <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to vacate the 
excess portion of the land (which excess had been the subject of the additional 
lease agreement) because of his need for the premises, and the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> refused, their continued possession of the excess 
became <em>unlawful</em> — the filing of the complaint within the one-year 
statutory period makes the case fall under the jurisdiction of the City 
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Likewise, it is settled that the requirement regarding 
verification of a pleading is a formal, not a jurisdictional requisite.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is simply intended to secure an assurance that what are alleged in the 
pleading are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter 
of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thus, the court may order the correction of the pleading if not verified, 
<em>(Oshita v. Republic</em>, 19 SCRA 700 [1967]).<span>&nbsp; </span>The defect was 
merely formal.<span>&nbsp; </span>It did not affect the validity and efficacy of the 
pleading, much less the jurisdiction of the court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Gadit</em></span><em> v. Feliciano, Sr.</em>, 69 SCRA 388, 389 
[1976]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar the City Court correctly denied the motion to 
dismiss and allowed the amendment of the complaint by the verification of the 
same.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the assailed Order of the Court of
