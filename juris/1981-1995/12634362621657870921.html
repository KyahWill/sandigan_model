<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">After trial on
the merits, the trial court found the case meritorious for the prosecution in
Criminal Case Nos. 772 and 774 in view mainly of the testimony of the
complainant which was found credible.  Accused-appellant was, therefore, convicted for rape in said cases.  However, insofar as Criminal Case No. 773
was concerned, the trial court found the testimony of the complainant therein
inadequate to sustain conviction and "surmised that perhaps out of her
bitterness, the said complainant wanted to ensure that the accused be meted out
the highest penalty possible." Accused was accordingly acquitted in said
Criminal Case No. 773.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The complainant Mary Jane Espilan in all of these actions is
sixteen years old, unmarried and resident of Philex Mines, Baguio.  For the past three years immediately
preceding 1990, she continuously lived with her grandmother at the latter's
house at Bo. Fiangtin, Barlig, Mountain Province while her parents were
residing in Baguio.  At that time she
was a high school student.  The accused
Napoleon Subingsubing is the complainant's uncle, the brother of her mother and
the son of her grandmother.  Said
accused was then living with his mother and his niece in the same house as
mentioned.  On Nov. 25, 1989, at 1:00
P.M., Mary Jane and Napoleon were alone in the house, the grandmother having
gone to the fields.  When Mary Jane was
about to go out to attend her afternoon classes in school, Napoleon forcibly
pulled her to the bedroom of the grandmother, pointed his Garand rifle at her,
then punched her in the stomach as a result of which the former lost
consciousness.  When the complainant
regained her senses, she noticed that she was en dishabille and her vagina was
bloody.  She felt pain in her private
parts and is quite certain she was raped or abused.  The accused who was then standing outside the room warned the
complainant not to tell anybody what happened or else he will kill her.  Hence Mary Jane did not report the incident
to her grandmother or to anyone for that matter.  In the morning of November 28, 1989, at 10:30 o'clock A.M., Mary
Jane arrived from school and Napoleon was alone in the house.  The latter again leveled his Garand Rifle at
the former and pushed her into her bedroom.  The complainant tried to get out of the house but the accused held unto
her.  Inside the room, the said accused
pulled down the skirt of Mary Jane, pushed her down on the floor, stripped off
her panties and laid down on top of her with the zipper of his pants open.  Forcing the complainant's legs apart, the
accused abused or took advantage of the former the second time around.  All the while, Napoleon was holding unto his
rifle and Mary Jane was afraid to scream for he might squeeze the trigger.  Immediately thereafter, the complainant
gathered up all her clothes and went to their own family house at Bo. Pat-tog,
Barlig which is less than a kilometer away from her grandmother's
residence.  She wanted to get away from
her uncle, hence she stayed alone in the house until November 30, 1989 in the
morning when the accused followed her.  She was then cleaning the ceiling of their house when Napoleon sneaked
up behind her, and when the former tried to scream, the accused placed a piece
of cloth soaked with some sort of chemical over the nose of the complainant and
the latter fainted.  When she awoke,
Mary Jane found herself lying on the floor stark naked.  She felt that she had again been sexually
molested.  The accused who was outside
the house menacingly ordered the complaiÂ­nant to pack her clothes and go back
home with him.  The afternoon of the
same day, Mary Jane and Napoleon went back to the house of the former's
grandmother.  The complainant did not
reveal to anybody the things that happened to her for fear that the accused
might really kill her as the accused had threatened to do.  Months later, when she was with her parents
in Baguio, Mary Jane finally divulged everything to her mother Rosita
Espilan.  They went back to Barlig and
reported the incidents to the police station where the statement of the
complainant was taken (Exhs. "A," Crim. Case No. 772, pp. 4-5; Crim.
Cases Nos. 773-774, pp. 2-3).  Thereafter, she had herself physically examined at the Barlig hospital
by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>government
physician and was found pregnant (Exh. "C"; p. 6, Crim. Case No.
772).  On August 29, 1990 in Baguio, the
complainant delivered a baby boy.  The
latter before all these things happened to her was a virgin with no prior
sexual experience.  She did not even
have a boyfriend.  In open court, Mary
Jane Espilan singled out the accused Napoleon Subingsubing as the culprit in
all of the incidents she earlier testified to.</blockquote>

morning of 25 November 1989, he arrived </span>at his mother's house at Bo.
Fiangtin, Barlig, Mountain Province after fetching wood.  Shortly thereafter, the complainant arrived
from school, massaged the back of the accused and then prepared their
lunch.  After eating, the accused went
to his room to rest but was followed by the complainant who laid down beside
him, placed her hand on the accused's stomach, and then the pair embraced.  They both removed their clothes and then had
sexual intercourse.  At this time, the
complainant was smiling, tightly embracing the accused.  After the intercourse, the complainant put on
her clothes, went to her room to change and then went back to school.  That evening, the accused brought the
complaiÂ­nant to attend a wake.  The
accused also professed that the incident on 25 November 1989 was the only
occasion when he had sexual intercourse with the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">On 28 November

1989.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">To bolster the
claim of the accused, his mother, Rufina Subingsubing, who is also the
grandmother of the complaiÂ­nant, testified,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

them were living in one house and that their relationship was happy, even after
the month of November 1989; that the complainant left her house in March 1990
for a vacation and was fetched by her mother; that the only thing she observed
about the complainant was that her breasts were becoming bigger; that the
complainant and the accused got food for the pigs on Saturdays and that when
the latter would receive his monthly salary, the complainant would ask him to
take her to the movies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Three (3) other
witnesses for the defense were presented who corroborated the story of the
accused and testified that indeed, the complainant and the accused were seen
going out together and sharing happy moments months after November 1989 (when
the alleged rapes were committed).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a fundamental rule in criminal procedure that the
prosecution has the <u>onus probandi</u> in establishing the guilt of the accused,
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>consequence
of the tenet <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ei </span>incumbit
probatio qui dicit, non qui negat</u>, that is, he who asserts, not he who
denies, must prove.  This is especially
significant in rape cases for, generally, in the prosecution thereof, the only
two (2) parties who can testify as to the occurrence are the complainant and
the accused.  Very often, their
respective testimonies are diametrically contradictory as to what really
happened.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">A careful perusal of the records of the present case reveals,
even if we were to assume <u>arguendo</u> that the defense <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">of consent on the part of the
complainant was not suffiÂ­ciently established, that the evidence for the
prosecution cannot, on its own, stand and suffice to establish the guilt of the
accused for the crime of rape beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Although the
general rule is that this Court by and large respects the factual findings of
the trial court because of its better position in assessing the credibility of
witnesses through close scrutiny of their demeanor, mannerism and attitude, the
present case falls short of convincing us that it falls under such general
rule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">A perusal of the
records and the testimony of the complainant discloses contradictions and

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The
complainant's theory of force and intimidation manifested in her sworn
statement and her testimony </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

April 1991.  Complainant speaks of
resistance, intimidation, and loss of consciousness attributed to accused's
violence and threats.  However, and this
must be carefully noted, the complainant's testimony on 02 April 1991 gave </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;mso-bidi-font-style:

description of what transpired during those incidents.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The Court also
cannot help but question the conduct of the complainant after the alleged
incidents of rape.  The complainant did
not reveal the incidents </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">her grandmother allegedly because the accused told her not to
and that he would kill the complainant and her grandmother if she told
anyone.  Neither did she tell her mother
upon the latter's arrival at Barlig on 28 April 1990 or soon after the </span>complainant
was brought by her mother to Philex Mines in Baguio City.  The mother was told of the alleged incidents
only on 15 May 1990.  It is quite
unnatural for a girl not to reveal such assaults on her virtue (if indeed they
occurred) immediately after they happened or when the alleged threat on her
life and her grandmother's had ceased, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>in this case, when complainant had gone to Baguio.  The complainant likewise admitted that after
the alleged incidents in November 1989, she still went out with the accused to
watch betamax movies or get food for the pigs in the ricefields.  Such behaviour directly contradicts the
normal or expected behaviour of a rape victim.  There is no way she could possibly forgive, to say the least; and yet,
complainant interacted immediately with her assailant.  Viewed in its entirety, such behaviour of
the complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">appears to be
inconsistent with her charge of rape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">The accused, on
the other hand, while admitting that indeed he had sexual intercourse with the
complainant on 25 November 1989, set up the defense that the latter consented
to such act.  The two (2) succeeding
incidents were however denied by the accused.  While we find such defenses weak, we nevertheless stress once more the
time-honored principle that the prosecution must rely on the strength of its
evidence rather than on the weakness of the defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Appellant's
exculpation from the offense of rape does not mean, however, that his
responsibility is merely moral and not penal in character.  If that were so, considering the facts of
this case, it may be cause for right-thinking men and women to discern a gap or
fissure in the legal order, one that cries moreover to be bridged.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">As things stand,
for failing to meet the exacting test of moral certainty, it is incumbent upon
us to set aside the trial court's judgments of conviction for rape.  However, the Court must state that it finds <u>conclusive</u>
<u>evidence</u> (no less than the accused-appellant's admission) that on 25
November 1989, the accused Napoleon Subingsubing had sexual intercourse with
Mary Jane Espilan when she was only 16 </span>years of age.  The complainant and the accused were living
in the same house.  The accused is the
uncle of the complainant, brother of her own mother.</p>
