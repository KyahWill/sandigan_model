<p>Before Us is a petition to review by <em>certiorari</em> 1) respondent 
court's decision which sets aside the order of default rendered by the trial 
court and 2) respondent court's resolution dated April 18, 1986 denying 
petitioners' (plaintiffs-appellees' therein) motion for extension of time to 
file motion for reconsideration of its decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The antecedent facts of the case 
are as follows:<br><br>Plaintiffs (petitioners herein) filed on December 16, 
1980, an action for abatement of a public nuisance with damages against 
defendant (private respondent herein).&nbsp; After being granted four (4) extensions 
of time to file an answer, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on February 
27, 1981 upon the ground that the lower court has no jurisdiction to hear the 
instant case and for lack of cause of action.&nbsp; However, the motion was denied by 
the court on April 3, 1981, a copy of which decision was received by the 
defendant on April 23, 1981.&nbsp; On May 5, 1981 defendant filed a motion for 
reconsideration which motion was denied on July 7, 1981.<br><br>Instead of 
filing an answer, petitioner filed with Us in G.R. No. 57593, <em>Daytona 
Construction &amp; Development Corporation vs. Rodriguez, et al.</em> a motion 
for extension of time to file a petition for review, but it never filed one, 
prompting Us to issue a resolution dated October 5, 1981 informing the parties 
and the trial court that no petition for review was filed within the period that 
expired on August 15, 1981.<br><br>Upon motion of plaintiffs, the court declared 
the defendant in default on November 4, 1981, and authorized the plaintiffs to 
present evidence <em>ex-parte</em>.&nbsp; Upon learning of the said order, the 
defendant on November 9, 1981 filed a motion to set aside the order of default 
and a motion to admit answer with counterclaim which motions were denied by the 
lower court in an order dated November 23, 1981.<br><br>On June 30, 1982, the 
court a quo rendered judgment for the plaintiffs and against defendant, its 
dispositive portion reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>Declaring the operation of the cement batching plant of the defendant 
corporation as a nuisance and ordering its permanent closure;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff Ernesto Rodriguez, Jr. the amount of 
P250,000.00 as moral damages and the amount of P5,000.00 as nominal 
damages;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff Ernesto Ll. Rodriguez III the amount 
of P200,000.00 as actual damages, the amount of P500,000.00 as moral damages and 
the amount of P5,000.00 as nominal damages;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff Sacha del Rosario the amount of 
P20,000.00 as actual damages, the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and the 
amount of P5,000.00 as nominal damages;<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to pay plaintiff Zenaida Z. Rodriguez the amount of 
P100,000.00 as actual damages, the amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages and 
the amount of P5,000.00 as nominal damages; and<br><br></li><li>Ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the amount of P50,000.00 as 
attorney's fees, plus the costs of suit.</li></ol>
<blockquote>
<p>"SO ORDERED." (pp. 63-64, Record on Appeal)</p></blockquote>
<p>In an order dated July 9, 1982, the trial court upon motion of plaintiffs 
granted execution pending appeal it indeed appearing as alleged in the motion 
that the continued operation of the cement batching plant of the defendant poses 
a "great menace to the neighborhood, both in point of health and 
property."<br><br>On July 23, 1982, defendant filed a petition for relief which 
was however denied by the lower court.&nbsp; On July 29, 1982, defendant filed a 
petition for injunction with the Intermediate Appellate Court which found the 
petition unmeritorious.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The appellate 
court promulgated on October 5, 1983, a decision denying due course to 
defendant's petition.<br><br>Its motion for reconsideration having been denied 
by the Appellate Court, defendant went on appeal by <em>certiorari</em> to the 
Supreme Court (G.R. No. 66097) which, after the submission of plaintiffs' 
comment and defendant's reply thereto, denied its petition for lack of 
merit.<br><br>The petition for injunction having been denied by both the IAC and 
this Court, defendant pursued the remedy of appeal in respondent IAC, assigning 
the following errors:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I.&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DECLARED APPELLANT IN DEFAULT DESPITE THE 
FACT THAT ITS FAILURE TO FILE ITS ANSWER ON TIME WAS DUE SOLELY TO THE 
NEGLIGENCE OF ITS COUNSEL AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE MOTION TO DISMISS THAT 
IT HAD FILED COULD HAVE VERY WELL STOOD AS THE ANSWER OF THE 
APPELLANT.<br><br>"II.&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER 
THE CASE AND WHEN IT RENDERED JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT AGAINST THE APPELLANT ON 
GROUNDS AND/OR BASIS NOT ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT FILED AGAINST THE 
APPELLANT.<br><br>"III.&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT ALLOW RELIEF FROM 
JUDGMENT IN THE FACE OF THE REASONS PRESENTED TO IT AS BASIS FOR SUCH 
RELIEF.<br><br>"IV.&nbsp; THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN DESPITE THE APPEAL HAVING BEEN 
DULY PERFECTED, IT DETAINED THE CASE WITH IT AND THEREAFTER, ISSUED AN ALIAS 
WRIT OF EXECUTION PENDING APPEAL WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PRIOR NOTICE TO THE 
APPELLANT." (pp. 1-2, Appellant's Brief)</p></blockquote>
<p>On March 21, 1986, respondent court promulgated its decision, the decretal 
portion of which is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is hereby reversed and set aside and 
another one entered, remanding the case to the court of origin for further 
proceedings and thereafter, to render judgment accordingly."<br><br>"No 
pronouncement as to costs."</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice of respondent Court's decision was received by plaintiffs-appellees 
thru counsel on April 3, 1986.&nbsp; Plaintiffs filed on April 15, 1986 a motion for 
extension of 30 days from April 18, 1986 or up to May 18, 1986 to file a motion 
for reconsideration.&nbsp; However, on May 10, 1986, they filed a 24-page motion for 
reconsideration.<br><br>Meanwhile, on April 23, 1986, defendant's opposition to 
the motion for extension and counter-motion to enter final judgment were 
received by plaintiffs.&nbsp; Plaintiffs countered with a reply filed April 29, 
1986.&nbsp; (Annex "C-2") Plaintiffs' counsel was surprised to receive on April 24, 
1986, respondent Court's resolution dated April 18, 1986, denying the motion for 
extension.&nbsp; Plaintiffs requested respondent Court to treat their aforesaid reply 
filed on April 29, 1986 as a motion for reconsideration of the said resolution 
of April 18, 1986, received by them on April 21, 1986, the request being 
contained in their opposition dated May 22, 1986, to defendant-appellant's 
motion to strike out the said opposition attached thereto as Annex "C-3".&nbsp; 
Neither the motion for reconsideration (converted from the reply filed on April 
29, 1986) nor the motion for reconsideration of the decision itself was acted 
upon by respondent court.<br><br>Hence this petition to review, petitioners 
alleging that "Respondent court's challenged resolution purporting to deny 
appellees' motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration is 
a nullity because the decision in <em>Habaluyas v. Japson </em>case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> solely relied on by the said resolution 
has been made by the Supreme Court to operate prospectively and thereby rendered 
inapplicable to parties situated as petitioners are, in order precisely to spare 
them from unfair and unjust deprivation of their right to appeal."<br><br>In Our 
resolution, promulgated May 30, 1986 in the Habaluyas case itself (G.R. No. 
70895), We set aside the original judgment therein, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"However, the law and the Rules of Court do not expressly prohibit the filing 
of a motion for extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration of a 
final order or judgment.<br><br>"In the case of <em>Gibbs vs. Court of First 
Instance</em> (80 Phil. 160), the Court dismissed the petition for certiorari 
and ruled that the failure of defendant's attorney to file the petition to set 
aside the judgment within the reglementary period was due to excusable neglect, 
and, consequently, the record on appeal was allowed.&nbsp; <em>The Court did not rule 
that the motion for extension of time to file a motion for new trial or 
reconsideration could not be granted</em>.<br><br>"In the case of <em>Roque vs. 
Gunigundo</em> (Administrative Case No. 1684, March 30, 1979, 89 SCRA 178), a 
division of the Court cited the Gibbs <em>decision</em> to support a statement 
that a motion to extend the reglementary period for filing the motion for 
reconsideration is not authorized or is not in order.<br><br>"The Intermediate 
Appellate Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> is sharply divided on 
this issue. Appeals have been dismissed on the basis of the original decision in 
this case.<br><br>"After considering the able arguments of counsels for 
petitioners and respondents, the Court resolved that the<em> interest of 
justice</em> would be better served if the ruling in the original decision 
<em>were applied prospectively from the time herein stated.&nbsp; The reason is that 
it would be unfair to deprive parties of their right to appeal simply because 
they availed themselves of a procedure which was not expressly prohibited or 
allowed by the law or the Rules</em>.&nbsp; x x x" (pp. 3-4; Resolution dated May 30, 
1986 in G.R. No. 70895; underscoring supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>This Court further elucidated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"1.) <em>Beginning one month after the promulgation of this Resolution, the 
rule shall be strictly enforced that no motion for extension of time to file a 
motion for new trial or reconsideration</em> may be filed with the Metropolitan 
or Municipal Trial Courts, the Regional Trial Courts, and the Intermediate 
Appellate Court.&nbsp; <em>Such a motion may be filed only in cases pending with the 
Supreme Court</em> as the court of last resort, which may in its sound 
discretion either grant or deny the extension requested." (p. 4; underscoring 
supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>The above new rules are made effective no earlier than June 30, 1986.&nbsp; In the 
instant case, respondent Court's decision was received by plaintiffs on April 3, 
1986.&nbsp; Plaintiffs or petitioners herein filed on April 15, 1986 a motion for 
extension of 30 days from April 18, 1986 or up to May 18, 1986 to file a motion 
for reconsideration.&nbsp; On May 10, 1986, plaintiffs filed their motion for 
reconsideration.&nbsp; Plaintiffs' motion for extension of time was not intended for 
delay but upon showing of good cause, to wit:&nbsp; "for lack of material time due to 
heavy pressure of work on the part of petitioners' counsel presently taking 
charge thereof, what is more the counsel handling this case was doing so for the 
first time in substitution of Atty. Emmanuel Pelaez, who was recently appointed 
Philippine Ambassador to the U.S."<br><br>It is clear therefore that 
petitioners' motion was based on good cause and was filed opportunely making the 
act of respondent Court unwarranted in denying petitioners' motion for extension 
of time to file its motion for reconsideration.<br><br>Another important issue 
raised by the petitioners is that the "subject decision which purports to set 
aside the order of default rendered by the trial court is a nullity because 
respondent court arbitrarily ignored in grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack of jurisdiction 1) the conclusive effect of the trial court's final and 
unappealed order denying defendant's motion to set aside the default order," and 
2) the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the appellate court's final judgment in 
the injunction case aforementioned upholding the trial court's order granting 
execution of its judgment pending appeal and, necessarily, the default order as 
well 3) the law of the case effect of the appellate court's express ruling in 
the said injunction case sustaining the default order.<br><br>Petitioners' 
contentions merit our consideration.<br><br>It has been Our consistent ruling 
that a default order, being interlocutory, is not appealable but an order 
denying a motion or petition to set aside an order of default is not merely 
interlocutory but final and therefore immediately appealable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Since the trial court's order of 
November 13, 1981, denying defendant's motion to set aside the order of default 
was appealable but was not appealed by defendant, the necessary conclusion is 
that the default order became final.&nbsp; Clearly therefore, respondent Court 
committed a grave abuse of discretion in disregarding the finality of the 
default order.<br><br>The validity and finality of the default order was upheld 
by the judgment of the Appellate Court in the injunction case (which passed upon 
the merits of the issuance of an order of execution pending appeal) by virtue of 
the principle of res judicata and the doctrine re the law of the 
case.<br><br>There is no question that there were good reasons for the trial 
court to issue the order of execution pending appeal.&nbsp; The order categorically 
stated that there was a need for the closure and stoppage of the operation of 
defendant's (Daytona Construction) cement batching plant because it posed "a 
great menace to the neighborhood both in point of health and property." The 
trial court thus stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the uncontroverted evidence presented by the plaintiffs, there is 
hardly any question that the cement dust coming from the batching plant of the 
defendant corporation is injurious to the health of the plaintiffs and other 
residents in the area.&nbsp; The noise, the vibration, the smoke and the odor 
generated by the day and night operation of the plant must indeed be causing 
them serious discomfort and untold miseries.&nbsp; Its operation therefore violates 
certain rights of the plaintiffs and causes them damage.&nbsp; It is thus a nuisance 
and its abatement justified." (Decision, p. 5; p. 90, 
<em>Rollo</em>)</p></blockquote>
<p>after taking into consideration evidence presented by plaintiffs (petitioners 
herein) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The evidence shows that the defendant is a domestic corporation duly 
organized and existing under the laws of the Philippines with business address 
at 252 Don Mariano Marcos Avenue (actually South Zuzuarregui Avenue), Quezon 
City.&nbsp; It was issued by the Quezon City government a business permit (Exhibit B) 
for the manufacture of road and building concrete materials such as concrete 
aggregates, with cement batching plant.&nbsp; Among the conditions set forth in the 
permit are that the said batching plant shall (1) institute measures to prevent 
dust emission during the manual charging of cement from bags to the receiving 
hopper of the bucket elevator of the batching plant; (2) remove all sediment 
deposit in the settling of tank for process water and proper maintenance should 
be observed at all times.&nbsp; While the original permit issued to the defendant 
stated that its operation at the place shall 'not (be) beyond Dec. 31, 1979' 
(Exhibit B-2), it was somehow allowed to operate way beyond said 
period.<br><br>"Plaintiff Ernesto Ll. Rodriguez III testified that he has three 
parcels of residential lots adjacent to the Daytona compound.&nbsp; He informed the 
Court that his property, with an area of 8,892 square meters has been over-run 
by effluence from the cement batching plant of the defendant.&nbsp; The sediment 
settled on the lots and all forms of vegetation have died as a result, and the 
land tremendously diminished in value.&nbsp; His three lots are located in a prime 
residential zone and each square meter in the area is easily valued at P500.00.&nbsp; 
While he would like to sell at least a part of his property, he finds no buyer 
because of its condition.&nbsp; It would cost him no less than P250,000.00 to be able 
to repair the damage done to his property, and since its present condition has 
been existing during the last five years, he claimed that the interest on his 
loss would be about P5,000.00.&nbsp; He has agreed to his counsel's fee of 
P200,000.00.&nbsp; Zenaida Rodriguez testified that she owns a lot with an area of 
1,500 square meters.&nbsp; Two thirds of this area has been damaged by the cement 
dust, emanating from the defendant's cement batching plant.&nbsp; The continous flow 
of cement dust into her property affected her deep well, their source of 
drinking water, and most of their fruit-bearing and ornamental trees dried up.&nbsp; 
She also said that she has had sleepless nights and became nervous as a result 
of the batching plant operation.&nbsp; Even her previous pedigreed poodles have been 
afflicted by all sorts of illnesses, many of them dying in the process.&nbsp; She 
claimed to have sustained damages amounting to P370,000.00.<br><br>"Sacha del 
Rosario testified that her house has to close its windows most of the time 
because of the dust pollution and her precious plants have been destroyed by the 
cement powder coming from the constant traffic of trucks and other vehicles 
carrying the product of the batching plant passing through her area.&nbsp; She claims 
damages amounting to more than P100,000.00.<br><br>"A chemical engineer, 
Alexander Cruz, said that the effluence deposited on the properties of Ernesto 
LI. Rodriguez III and Zenaida Rodriguez has a very high PH, 11.8, and the soil 
is highly alkaline and cannot support plant life; that pollution coming from the 
batching plant can cause stomach disorder and skin problems; that the place of 
Ernesto Ll. Rodriguez III is bare of grass and the trees are dying, (Exhibits J, 
J-1 and J-2) and that there is also a high degree of calcium on the property in 
question.<br><br>"Witness Guido L. Quiban, a civil engineer, testified that on 
the basis of his examination of the property of Rodriguez III affected by the 
pollution, it would cost at least P250,000.00 for the excavation filling, 
concreting of canal and rental of equipment to repair it or restore it to its 
status <em>quo ante</em>.<br><br>"Lawyer Ernesto R. Rodriguez, Jr., the 70-year 
old father of both Ernesto III and Zenaida Z. Rodriguez, submitted a medical 
certificate that he had recently been taken ill with acute bronchial asthma, 
hypertension and atherosclerotic heart disease.&nbsp; (Exhibits L, L-1 to L-4).&nbsp; His 
physician, a specialist graduate from the University of London and connected 
with various hospitals in Manila, advised him against exposure to environmental 
allegens, specifically cement dust and pollution.&nbsp; He also submitted as exhibits 
various newspaper clippings (Exhibit M) and excerpts from a book (Exhibits N and 
N-1) showing that pollution can irritate the eye, sear lungs and destroy 
vegetation, raise blood pressure, increase cholesterol levels, interfere with 
sleep, cause ulcer, trigger heart attacks and the like; that it is the common 
denominator of respiratory diseases, especially asthma chronic bronchitis, 
bronchial asthma and emphysema; and that polluted air can develop abnormalities 
in lung function.<br><br>"Dr. Raul I. del Rosario, a neighboring physician, 
testified that he had treated several patients who traced their sickness to the 
pollution caused by defendant Daytona batching plant.&nbsp; He said that cement dust 
produces broncho-pulmonary obstructive diseases, broncho fibriotic lesions which 
may produce cardio pulmonary complications, and the people living in the 
neighborhood of the batching plant are the most susceptible to these diseases.&nbsp; 
He reported many cases of bronchial asthma in both children and adult who live 
in the vicinity of the cement batching plant and these cases have been 
intermittently admitted and discharged from the Quirino Labor Hospital where he 
presently works as a resident physician.&nbsp; He had intended to open a medical 
clinic at his residence but he could not do so because the washings from the 
cement mixers are dumped on the access road in front of his house and when these 
washings are dried up they pollute the neighborhood, rendering his intended 
medical clinic unfit and impractical for the treatment of patients, particularly 
those suffering from respiratory ailments.<br><br>"Another lawyer, Eliseo 
Alampay, Jr., who likewise resides a few meters away from the site of the 
Daytona batching plant, testified that the said plant is certainly injurious to 
the health; that the cement dust are agents of lung ailments, impair the growth 
of plants and even kill the birds in their cages; that it is a demonstrable 
nuisance because its uncontrolled engine noise and nightlong pounding prevent 
the neighborhood from being able to sleep soundly and peacefully.&nbsp; He told the 
court that there was a time when he felt like organizing the whole neighborhood 
into a demolition team to forcibly dismantle the entire Daytona plant because 
'the authorities concerned apparently have chosen to close their eyes and leave 
us to our miserable plight.' He said that the homes in the community all look 
dirty and dusty because of the pollution that the batching plant of the 
defendant causes." (Decision in Injunction Case, AC-G.R. No. 14602-SP, pp. 
10-14)</p></blockquote>
<p>Anent the default order, the appellate court in the injunction case said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From the foregoing, it appears that petitioner was recreant in failing to 
file an answer after respondent judge denied its motion to dismiss the 
complaint.&nbsp; The motion to dismiss was denied in the order of the lower court 
under date of April 3, 1981, a copy of which was received by petitioner on April 
23, 1981.&nbsp; A motion for reconsideration of the order of denial filed by 
petitioner on May 7, 1981 was denied by said court on July 7, 1981.&nbsp; Instead of 
filing an answer promptly, petitioner filed with the Supreme Court a motion for 
extension of time to file a petition for review, <em>but it never filed 
one</em>, prompting the Supreme Court to issue a resolution dated October 5, 
1981 informing the parties that no petition for review was filed within the 
period that expired on August 15, 1981.&nbsp; Inspite of the Supreme Court's 
resolution, petitioner <em>still failed to file</em> any answer or pleading to 
arrest the running of the prescriptive period.&nbsp; It was only on July 23, 1982, 
when petitioner filed its Petition for Relief which was<em> nine</em> (9) 
<em>months </em>after the Supreme Court's resolution was issued.&nbsp; Petitioner's 
assertion in its Petition for Relief that the failure to file the answer was 
caused by 'the unforseen sickness of its corporate secretary who has custody of 
the records necessary for the preparation of its defense' cannot be taken 
without much doubt and hesitation.&nbsp; Petitioner did not even point out who was 
the supposed corporate secretary or explain why the records were in the 
possession of the corporate secretary instead of the counsel handling the case." 
(Decision in Injunction case, p. 16; underscoring supplied)</p></blockquote>
<p>With reference to defendant's allegation that it thought that the period 
within which to answer (after its motion to dismiss had been denied) had been 
suspended by its having filed a petition for review before the Supreme Court, 
same is without merit.&nbsp; The circumstances of the case point to a deliberate 
desire to delay:&nbsp; the corporation, governed as it is by knowledgeable business 
executives, should have taken steps to prevent its being declared in default.&nbsp; 
The corporation waited six (6) months before verifying the status of the case:&nbsp; 
in the meantime it had been declared in default, a judgment by default had been 
rendered against it, execution was already pending before it woke up to file the 
case at hand.<br><br>We agree with Justice Luis A. Javellana in his concurring 
opinion in the injunction case before the appellate court, thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Petitioner's conduct here appears to me to be tainted with fraud and 
intended simply to delay the disposition of the case.&nbsp; When its motion to 
dismiss the complaint was denied, and its motion for reconsideration of that 
denial was, likewise, denied, it manifested its intention to elevate these 
orders to the Supreme Court on a petition for review.&nbsp; Yet, it did nothing to 
this end.&nbsp; The purpose of the ploy is obvious.&nbsp; Once it had announced its 
intention to go to the Supreme Court, it effectively suspended the proceedings 
in the trial court, or, at least, that was the effect.&nbsp; This enabled it to 
continue with its operations and it would have done so indefinitely if it had 
not been declared in default and private respondents allowed to present their 
evidence.&nbsp; <em>It is quite apparent that petitioner really had no intention of 
elevating the case to the Supreme Court, otherwise, it would not have allowed 
the extended period given to it by the Supreme Court to lapse without filing the 
petition.&nbsp; Or, if it was in good faith, then, it should have informed the trial 
court that it was no longer pursuing its remedy in the Supreme Court, after it 
had decided that it was no longer availing of such remedy.&nbsp; Instead, it 
concealed this fact from the trial court and the adverse party, and allowed 
matters to take their course.&nbsp; It was not until it received the adverse decision 
that it frantically sought to set things right.&nbsp; I do not think that petitioner 
deserves any consideration for trifling with the administration of 
justice</em>." (pp. 3-4; underscoring supplied)</p></blockquote>
