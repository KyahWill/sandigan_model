				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The crucial issue in this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
is whether or not the lower court, given the factual allegations in the
complaint, had correctly assumed jurisdiction over the petitioner, a foreign
corporation, on its claim in a motion to dismiss, that it had since ceased to
do business in the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, Signetics Corporation (Signetics), was organized
under the laws of the United States of America.  Through Signetics Filipinas Corporation (SigFil), a wholly-owned
subsidiary, Signetics entered into a lease contract over a piece of land with
Fruehauf Electronics Phils., Inc. (Fruehauf).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a complaint initiated on 15 March 1990 Freuhauf sued Signetics
for damages, accounting or return of certain machinery, equipment and
accessories, as well as the transfer of title and surrender <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>possession of the buildings,
installations and improvements on the leased land, before the Regional Trial
Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>Pasig, Metro Manila
(Civil Case No. 59264).  Claiming that
Signetics caused SigFil to insert in the lease contract the words
"machineries, equipment and accessories," the defendants were able to
withdraw these assets from the cost-free transfer provision of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the allegation that Signetics is a
"subsidiary of US PHILIPS CORPORATION, and may be served summons at
Philips Electrical Lamps, Inc., Las Piñas, Metro Manila and/or c/o Technology
Electronics Asembly &amp; Management (TEAM) Pacific Corporation, Electronics
Avenue, FTI Complex, Taguig, Metro Manila," service of summons was made on
Signetics through TEAM Pacific Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">By special appearance,
Signetics filed on 14 May 1990 a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground
of </span>lack of jurisdiction over its person.  Invoking Section 14, Rule 14, of the Rules of Court and the rule
laid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">down </span>in <u>Pacific</u> <u>Micronisian</u>

denied the motion to dismiss <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>an
Order, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of <u>Wang</u> <u>Laboratories</u>, <u>Inc</u>. <u>v</u>.
<u>Mendoza</u>, 156 SCRA 44, the High Court explained what constitutes 'doing
business' as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Indeed it has been held that "where a single act or
transaction of a foreign corporation is not merely incidental or casual but is
of such character as distinctly to indicate a purpose to do other business in
the State, such constitutes doing business within the meaning of statutes prescribing
the conditions under which a foreign corporation may be served with summons
(Far East Int'l. Import and Export Corp. v. Nankai Kogyo Co. Ltd., 6 SCRA 725
[1962]).'</p>

<blockquote>Assuming, arguendo, that defendant is a foreign corporation not
doing business in the Philippines, it has been categorically stated in the
aforecited case that although a foreign corporation is not doing business in
the Philippines, it may be sued for acts done against persons in the
Philippines.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>For lack of sufficient merits therefore, defendant's Motion to
Dismiss is hereby DENIED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Signetics filed a motion for reconsideration but this, too, was
denied by the court in its Order of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> 11 </span>March
1991, reiterating that the rule expressed in <u>Wang</u> <u>Laboratories</u>, <u>Inc</u>.

the applicable and prevailing "jurisprudence on the matter."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Signetics elevated the issue to the Court of Appeals, <u>via</u>
a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, with application for
preliminary injunction (CA-G.R. SP No. 24758).  On 20 February 1992, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the petition and affirming the orders of the lower court.  A motion for the reconsideration of the
appellate court's decision, having been denied, the instant petition for review
on <i>certiorari</i> was filed with this Court, still on the "basic
question" of whether or not "a foreign corporation can be sued in the
Philippines and validly summoned by a Philippine court without prior 'proof'<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>that it was doing business here at
the time of the suit."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Critically dissecting the complaint, the petitioner stresses that
the averments in the complaint "are at best <u>mere</u> <u>allegations</u>
and do not constitute <u>proof</u> of 'doing business';"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that the allegations, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>any
case, do not demonstrate "doing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">business";
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>that the phrase
"becoming interested in doing business" is "not actual doing of
business here." The petitioner argues that what was effectively only
alleged in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>the complaint as an
activity of doing business was "the mere equity investment" of petitioner
in SigFil, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">which </span>the petitioner
insists, had theretofore been transferred to TEAM Holdings, Ltd..<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner relies, in good part, on the <u>Pacific</u> <u>Micronisian</u>
rule.  The pronouncements in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Wang</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

corporations involved in both <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">cases were

local court processes.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule for the affirmance of the appealed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that there should be "proof" of
the foreign corporation's doing business in country before it may be summoned
is based on the following portions of the decision in <u>Pacific</u> <u>Micronisian</u>:</p>

<blockquote>"The pertinent rule to be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">is </span>section 14, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>which refers to service upon private

- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

stock company or association, doing business in the Philippines, service may be
made on its resident agent designated in accordance with law for that purpose,
or, if there be no such agent, on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">government
</span>official designated by law to that effect, or on any of its officers or
agents within the Philippines.'<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

namely:  (1) by serving upon the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agent designated in accordance with law to accept
service by summons; (2) if there be no special agent, by serving on the
government official designated by law to that effect; and (3) by serving on any
officer or agent within the Philippines.  But, it should be noted, in order that services may be effected </span>in
the manner above stated, said section also requires that the foreign
corporation be one which is <u>doing</u> <u>business</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u>.  This is a <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>
requirement.  This fact must first be
established in order that summons can be made and jurisdiction acquired.  This is not only clear in the rule but is
reflected in a recent decision of this<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>Court.  We there said that ‘as long as a foreign
private corporation does or engages in business in this jurisdiction, it should
and will be amenable to process and the jurisdiction of the local courts.’

first be established in order that summons be made and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the complaint, in this instance, has alleged,
among other things, that Signetics had become interested in engaging in
business in the Philippines; that it had actually organized SigFil, as its
local business conduit or actual operating entity in the Philippines; that,
through Sigfil, it had entered into the lease contract involving properties in
the Philippines a situation that could have allowed Freuhauf to avail itself of
the provisions of Section 17, Rule 14, on extraterritorial, service of summons
since the relief sought consists <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">in </span>excluding

claims is a "devious" attempt to "shield chicanery and to
perpetuate fraud" (see paragraphs 23 and 24, Complaint).  On this score, what might in a way also be
revealing is that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">after </span>Freuhauf
had moved to sell the attached property subject matter of the litigation, the
petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">filed </span>the following
pleading, intriguingly captioned, "Manifestation"; viz:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendant, by counsel, respectfully states:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  Plaintiff filed a Motion to Sell Attached
Properties and scheduled it for hearing on August 24, 1990, justifying the sale
on the allegations that certain properties belonging to the defendant are
perishable in nature and liable to material depreciation in value.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  In pleadings filed by the defendant, the
Court was requested to determine whether there is a valid attachment on this
alleged properties.  This determination
is necessary because defendant has pointed out that personal jurisdiction could
not be justified on the basis of the so-called attachment because it was
legally ineffective.  Two reasons were
given to the Court.  First, the property
has not been taken into actual custody of the sheriff as required by Rule 57,
Section 7 (c).  Second, the property has
not been shown to be owned by the defendant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Since jurisdiction over the defendant is
premised on the attachment, the Honorable Court should therefore act on the
motion to sell by determining (i) whether plaintiff has shown that the property
proposed to be sold belongs to the defendant (ii) whether it was effectively
attached and (iii) whether its sale is justified (because it is perishable or
deteriorating in value).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the motion to sell was filed by
Freuhauf "ostensibly to ask permission to sell properties (sic.), but
really to hurt petitioner in the first fight" (meaning the dismissal
incident) because Freuhauf used the motion to sell "incident" as
forum to prove <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ex-parte</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>its argument <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

from continuing the "fight" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on

<p class="BODY">Having said that, Freuhauf, in effect, has invoked the doctrine
of piercing the veil of corporate fiction, and it cannot thus be held to have
improperly caused the service of summons on TEAM Pacific pursuant to Section

allegations in the complaint, taken together, have thus been able to amply <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">convey </span>that not only is TEAM Pacific
the business conduit of the petitioner in the Philippines but that, also, by
the charge of fraud, is none other than the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">any </span>event, it
may well be that the Court should restate the rule, and it is that a foreign
corporation, although not engaged in business in the Philippines, may still
look up to our courts for relief; reciprocally, such corporation may likewise
be "sued in Philippine courts for acts done against a person or persons in
the Philippines" (<u>Facilities</u> <u>Management</u> <u>Corporation</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Osa</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>),
provided that, in the latter case, it would not be impossible for court
processes to reach the foreign corporation, a matter that can later be
consequential in the proper execution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of
</span>judgment.  Verily, a State may
not exercise jurisdiction in the absence of some good basis (and not offensive
to traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice) for effectively
exercising it, whether the proceedings are <u>in</u> <u>rem</u>, <u>quasi</u> <u>in</u>
<u>rem</u> or <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say, however, that the petitioner's right to
question the jurisdiction of the court over its person is now to be deemed a
foreclosed matter.  If it is true, as
Signetics claims, that its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">only </span>involvement
in the Philippines was through a passive investment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">in </span>Sigfil,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
which it even later disposed of; and that TEAM Pacific not its agent, then it
cannot really be said to be doing business in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Philippines.  </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>a defense, however, that requires
the contravention of the allegations of the complaint, as well as a full
ventillation, in effect, of the main merits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the case, which should not thus be within the province of a
mere motion to dismiss.  So, also, the
issue posed by the petitioner as to whether a foreign corporation which has
done business in the country, but which has ceased to do business at the time
of the filing of a complaint, can still be made to answer for a cause of action
which accrued while it was doing business, is another matter that would yet
have to await the reception and admission of evidence.  Since these points have seasonably been
raised by the petitioner, there should be no real cause for what may
understandably be its apprehension, i.e., that by its participation during the
trial on the merits, it may, absent an invocation of separate or independent
reliefs of its own, be considered to have voluntarily submitted itself to the
court's jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told Signetics cannot, at least in this early stage, assail,
on the one hand, the veracity and correctness of the allegations in the
complaint and proceed, on the other hand, to prove its own, in order to hasten
a peremptory escape.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
