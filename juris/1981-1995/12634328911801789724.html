"<span class="SpellE">Aris</span> (Philippines) Inc., v. Federation of Free
Workers, Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rosana</span>, et al."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision dated April 11, 1978 declared
the illegality of the strike; ordered all striking employees except the union
officers to return to work within twenty four (24) hours from the receipt of
the order; revoked the previous order dated April 2, 1978; granted the
application for clearance to place all union officers under preventive
suspension and placed the administration of the union and the collective
bargaining agreement directly under the Federation of Free Workers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second assailed decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1979</st1:date> granted the
application for clearance to terminate the services of eighteen (18) union
officers and member of the FFW local union.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Federation of Free Workers (FFW) is <span style="">a </span>legitimate labor organization duly
registered with the Ministry of Labor while petitioners Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rosana</span>, Fe <span class="SpellE">Diviña</span>, Patricio

Incorporated (company) is a duly organized domestic corporation engaged in the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1977</st1:date>,
a certification election was held in private respondent company under the
supervision of the Bureau of Labor Relations.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner FFW garnered the highest number of votes and was subsequently
declared the authorized bargaining representative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, private respondent company and petitioner FFW
executed a memorandum of agreement on February 3, 1978 wherein (a) the company
recognized FFW as the bargaining representative of the rank and file employees
in the bargaining unit as of February 1, 1978; (b) the company and FFW shall
negotiate for a new collective bargaining agreement, but in the meantime FFW
will continue to administer the then existing CBA which expired on December 31,
1977 until a new CBA is executed; and (c) FFW will be entitled to all union
dues starting February 1, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same
hold-over CBA contained a "no strike - no lockout clause."</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the aforementioned memorandum of agreement, the
company and FFW met on February 7, 13, 15, 22 and 25, 1978 to negotiate for a
new CBA that would govern the terms and conditions of employment of the rank
and file employees in the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the parties failed to reach any agreement and a deadlock
ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1978</st1:date>,
the FFW through its president, petitioner Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Rosana</span>
filed with the MOLE (now DOLE) a notice of strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">The company and FFW met on March 7, 13, 27 and 29, 1978 at the
Bureau of Labor Relations for conciliation upon summons by Director <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the parties still failed to reach,
any accord, so on March 29, 1978, FFW requested respondent <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> (then Acting Secretary) to assume
jurisdiction over the labor dispute and undertake to terminate the case within
two weeks (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1978</st1:date>,
after the required thirty (30) days notice, the FFW staged a strike on all the
three (3) plants of the company (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
19-20).</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent company having been classified as a vital
industry pursuant to Letter of Instruction No. 368 and thus protected by
Presidential Decree No. 823, as amended against any strike, the respondent
Deputy Minister assumed jurisdiction over the dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">A marathon conference was held on <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date> between the company and FFW in <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
with the active mediation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> and
Brig. Gen. Prospero <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the conference, an order dated April 2, 1978 was issued by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> directing the company to give a
wage increase of P3.00 for three years and to give one day additional vacation
and one day additional sick leave each and ordered the strikers to immediately
return to work (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 32-33).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the <span class="SpellE">FFW's</span> commitment to
abide by the aforesaid order of <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April
 2, 1978</st1:date>, the strikers not only failed to lift the picket lines and
return to work but intensified further the barricades.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 4, 1978, the company filed with the Secretary of Labor
an urgent motion to declare the strike illegal and to revoke the order of April
2, 1978 at the same time it applied for clearance to terminate the employment
of the illegal strikers with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor and
Employment for violation of Presidential Decree No. 823, as amended and General
Order No. 5.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the illegal strikers were placed under
preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Deputy Minister rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11<span class="GramE">,1978</span></st1:date>,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Based on the foregoing and by virtue of the powers of the
Secretary of Labor under PD 823 as amended, and in order to serve as a warning
to all others who violate or disregard the law and the authorities duly
empowered to enforce it, the following are hereby ordered:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

signing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the company shall
give one additional vacation <span style="">and sick
leave each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All other provisions of the
collective agreement which expired in December 1977 are deemed retained for
incorporation into the new CBA.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

union officers under preventive suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;

<span class="SpellE">Sy</span> of the Bureau of Labor Relations is hereby
designated as hearing officer and he shall submit this report and
recommendation to the Secretary of Labor within 20 working days from start of
hearing.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"5<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 23-25)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the company and FFW, through the mediation of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> entered into a memorandum of
agreement to end their dispute and the strike.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Pursuant to the
aforementioned memorandum of agreement, the company and FFW executed a CBA on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1978</st1:date> before respondent <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the application for clearance to terminate the employment
of the illegal strikers, the respondent Deputy Minister rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1979</st1:date> granting or
approving the application for clearance to terminate, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the application for

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1979</st1:date> issued a temporary restraining order
enjoining respondents from enforcing or executing the order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> and the decision dated
<st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1979</st1:date> (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 44-45).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners stress that the respondent's order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date> had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and therefore his subsequent decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> could not legally
revoke the said final order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law invoked by the petitioners is section 10 of Presidential
Decree No. 823 as amended, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 10.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a labor dispute has not been resolved
by the Regional Offices, the Bureau of Labor Relations, the National Labor
Relations Commission and the voluntary arbitrators within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the Secretary of Labor is hereby
authorized to assume jurisdiction over and summarily decide such dispute which
poses an emergency or is critical to the national interest as determined by him
on advise and recommendation of the Undersecretary of Labor, the Chairman of
the National Labor Relations Commission and the Director of the Bureau of Labor
Relations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the Labor Dispute Involves
A Notice Of Strike Or Lockout, the Secretary of Labor May, At Any <span style="">Time, Assume Jurisdiction And Summarily
Decide It.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>decision</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Secretary</u> <u>of</u> <u>Labor</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>final</u>
<u>and</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>executory</u></span> <u>unless</u> <u>stayed</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>President</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u>."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 13-14)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum, petitioners insist that respondent Deputy Minister
gravely abused his discretion and acted in total lack or in excess of his
jurisdiction when he issued his decisions dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, private respondent company emphasizes that the
fact that the order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date>
declared on its face that the awards given therein are the "final and
complete resolution of the issues" in the case does not mean that the said
order may no longer be revoked or modified by the Minister (now Secretary) of
Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It notes that the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> phrase simply means that all the issues raised
by the collective bargaining deadlock between the parties are already resolved
and completely settled but did not make the order final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
as of the date of issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
respondent Deputy Minister has the authority to modify and/or revoke his former
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, private respondent maintains that petitioners’
failure to seasonably move for reconsideration or appeal the decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> made it final and
therefore may no longer be reviewed by the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also underscores the fact that the
petitioners are already <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from questioning the
assailed decisions because the parties already executed a memorandum of
agreement on <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date>
and subsequently, a collective bargaining agreement on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In conformity with the private respondent's stand, the respondent
Deputy Minister through the Solicitor General argues that since the order dated
April 2, 1978 was not appealed to the Office of the President, it is still well
within the power of the respondent Deputy Minister to reconsider and revoke the
same (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 128).</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the Solicitor General stresses that the remedy of
appeal was not pursued by the petitioners but instead they allowed the decision
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> to
lapse into <span class="GramE">finality,</span> hence, they cannot now contest
the correctness of the said decision through a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
eleven (11) months after its promulgation (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 127).</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue therefore, is whether or not the respondent
Deputy Minister gravely abused his discretion when he revoked his former order
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records of this case, the Court
finds the petition devoid of merit and holds that the respondent Deputy
Minister did not gravely abuse his discretion when he revoked his previous
order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date>
and subsequently issued his decisions dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order dated April 2, 1978 of the Minister of Labor never
assumed finality by the very own acts of petitioner union who broke its
commitment to lift the strike when it resumed its blockades on the plant gates,
erected tents, posted new placards and circulated new leaflets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The narration of the incidents of the
controversy by the Deputy Minister of Labor in his decision dated April 11,
1978 shows that he even made a commitment to recommend affirmation by the Office
of the President of his April 2 order and to ask management not to raise the
illegality of the strike before the Department of Labor if only petitioner
union would accept the same upon the opening of working hours on the following
Monday, April 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He renewed this
commitment on <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1978</st1:date>
when the union officials promised before General Prospero <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>
at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and Mayor Joseph
Estrada to dismantle their pickets and return to work immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioner union again backed out
and continued their massive picketing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court is perplexed why petitioner union would now have the temerity
to claim that said order of <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2,
 1978</st1:date> had attained finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it is very clear that the remedy of petitioners against
the decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date>
revoking his previous order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April
 2, 1978</st1:date> is appeal to the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> may be
availed of in the alternative situation where an appeal would not constitute a
plain, speedy and adequate remedy, this is on the theoretical assumption that
the right to appeal is still available in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, however, the remedy by appeal had already
been lost and the loss was occasioned by petitioner's own neglect or error in
the choice of remedies, <i>certiorari</i> cannot lie as a substitute or a tool
to shield the petitioner from the adverse consequences of such neglect or
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two remedies are mutually
exclusive and not alternative or successive (Manila Electric Company v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 88396, July 4, 1990, 187 SCRA 200, 205).</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying this fundamental principle to the case at bar, it is
readily evident that the petitioners had ample opportunity to appeal the
decision of the respondent Deputy Minister revoking his previous order dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remedy of appeal to the Office of the
President was not pursued by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They nevertheless deliberately allowed the period for appeal to pass
without interposing one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse, despite
the then availability of the remaining period for appeal, the petitioners allowed
the decision to lapse into finality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, they cannot now contest the legality of the decision through the
present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the present petition hardly assailed the
correctness of the decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="1">January
 29, 1979</st1:date> despite petitioners’ supplemental petition seeking the
reinstatement of the individual petitioners with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and without loss of seniority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Deputy Minister already declared the strike staged
by the union illegal in his decision dated April 11, 1978, the pertinent
portion of which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be noted that the strike and the strike activities
undertaken by the union were patently illegal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, the employer is engaged in a vital industry and, therefore,
protected by PD 823 as amended from strikes and lockouts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, the Secretary of Labor had already
assumed jurisdiction over the dispute and therefore, the parties are enjoined
against strikes and lockouts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, the
parties themselves have voluntarily agreed to maintain the status quo, while
waiting for the summary decision of the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even if the strike were not illegal
per se, the strike activities staged by the union, especially the establishment
of massive human barricades at all entrances to the company and the use of
coercive methods to keep company officials and other personnel out, were
definitely illegal."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 20)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We already ruled in the case of Union of <span class="SpellE">Filipro</span>
Employees v. Nestle Philippines, Inc. (G.R. Nos. 88710-­13, December 19, 1990,
192 SCRA 396, 411) that "[a] strike that is undertaken despite the
issuance by the Secretary of Labor of an assumption or certification order
becomes a prohibited activity and thus illegal, pursuant to the second
paragraph of Art. <span class="GramE">264 of the Labor Code as amended (<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> Wood Products, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. 82088, October
13, 1989; 178 SCRA 482).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Union officers and members, as a result, are deemed to have lost <span style="">their employment </span>status for having
knowingly participated in an illegal act."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Unrebutted</span> evidence shows that the
individual petitioners actively participated in the illegal strike staged by
the union (see <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 27-28, 30).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hence, the termination of the services of
the individual petitioners is justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">All premises <span class="GramE">considered,</span> the Court is
convinced that the assailed decisions of the respondent Deputy Minister are not
tainted with arbitrariness that would amount to grave abuse of discretion or
lack of jurisdiction and therefore, We find no reason to disturb the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit
