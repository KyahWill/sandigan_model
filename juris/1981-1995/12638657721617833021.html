<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why was the
instruction simply to leave the sack of vegetables at Km. 5 with no specific
person or address to deliver it to?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
market is a public place and anything of economic value might be picked up by
other persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Banghito</span> was following in a private vehicle, why should the
former still request the accused to deliver a sack of vegetables when he could
very well do it himself?</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of any suspicious reaction on his part is not in accordance
with human nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And if he did not
mind carrying a sack from someone he hardly knew and who was following behind
in a car, it is obvious that the accused accepted the nature of the assignment
from <span class="SpellE">Banghito</span> as something he was willing to do and that
there was something strange about the transaction and he was aware of it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant further contends that there are
inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He </span>specifically
questions the prosecution witnesses’ statement that the sack contained dried
marijuana leaves whereas the chemical report revealed the same to be flowering
tops.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing questionable
about the description given by the arresting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">officers </span>because as stated by the Solicitor?General, “It is
dried marijuana, presumably brown in color already.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hard <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span>distinguish by ordinary eye which part of the marijuana plant
it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By</span> its look and smell, the agents
identified it as marijuana and mistakenly <span class="SpellE">labelled</span> it
marijuana leaves when it turned out to be flowering tops upon laboratory
analysis.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further questions the mark on the sack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the prosecution, the sack had a
label which read ‘14-14-14 Compound Fertilizer’ whereas the sack forwarded to
the laboratory for analysis was labeled ‘<span class="SpellE">Yongnara</span>
Chemical Co., Ltd.’ Whatever portions of the writings on the sack were cited in
testimonies, the fact remains that it was the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">same </span>sack which contained the marijuana
and that it was marked by the initials of the apprehending agent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questions raised by the appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">refer </span>to mere inconsistencies on minor details.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged inconsistencies and
improbabilities in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses stressed by the
<span class="GramE">appellant,</span> refer to insignificant details which cannot
destroy the credibility of said witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the alleged discrepancies <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">were </span>fully explained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
issue involves the credibility <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their testimony on the appellant’s being
caught with a sack of marijuana appears convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason to set aside the findings
of fact of the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(People </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Cabale</span>, et <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">al., </span>G.R.

as indicated in the information given to the agents of the law is of no

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the testimonies of defense witnesses are
incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The thrust of the defense
testimony is that the accused went to <span class="SpellE">Cabaguiasan</span> to
fetch his brother, Fernando because their mother is seriously ill but that the
brother <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>unable
to accompany him due to lack of fare; that while inside the bus, the accused
was requested<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> b</span>y <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span> <span class="SpellE">Banghito</span> to carry a sack
of vegetables for him to La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> with
instructions to leave it at Km. 5, with no particular addressee or place to
whom or where it would be delivered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">We
</span>note that the defense witnesses are mostly brothers of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, they may be expected to cover-up for
the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While relationship between
the accused and the witnesses is not necessarily detrimental, this
relationship, taken together with the want of logic of the defense testimonies,
yields the conclusion that it lacks credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The testimony of the
accused that his brother, Fernando was unable to go with him because he had no
fare is contrary to the brother’s testimony that he produces vegetables from
his less than a hectare of land and has a regular buyer for his produce.</p>

<p class="BODY">Con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">s</span>idering the
urgency of the need for them to go to their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">m</span>other’s place and the fact that it was the only reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the appellant’s going to his
brother’s place, they should have been able to raise the necessary fare by
selling Fernando’s produce to Lilia <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span>, his
regular buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they chose to go
to <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Copas</span> who
insisted that they first load the vegetables inside the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>When there was no
space available for them in the vehicle, they were instructed to meet him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span>the provincial restaurant at <span class="SpellE">Natubleng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabaguiasan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Benguet</span></span> where he would hand them
the money they <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>borrowing.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>quite
puzzling that the two (2) brothers should insist on borrowing from <span class="SpellE">Copas</span> when Fernando could just <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sell</span> his produce to <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span> whose place
was only a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>short ten minutes walk
from the place of <span class="SpellE">Copas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the need to see a seriously ill mother, a
son would normally do everything within his means to be able to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">go </span>to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As it is, the reason of Fernando for not
going to <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">sell </span>his goods was quite flimsy - that it was far which it was
not, if he was already at the address of <span class="SpellE">Copas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Fernando testified that he
eventually left <span class="SpellE">Buguias</span> on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="7">July 30, 1986</st1:date> and sold the vegetables for <u>P5<span class="GramE">,000</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>to <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span> on <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1986</st1:date> (TSN, pp. 122-123).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He could have gone directly to <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span> and
gotten more than enough money for bus fares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, he told his brother he would follow the next day but he later
testified that he followed the same day because he was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>able to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sell </span>his
produce to <span class="SpellE">Dalmose</span> in <span class="SpellE">Betag</span>,
La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Banguet</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He likewise admitted in his testimony that he
arrived at <span class="SpellE">Alilem</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> their mother’s place one week afterwards.</p>

<p class="BODY">Silver <span class="SpellE">Litawen</span>, the other defense

accused had been released although he knew that Alfonso had been arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">For testimony to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">be </span>believable,
it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but it must be

they are untruthful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the
Court, the accused was inside <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the bus
for no other purpose than to deliberately transport that sack containing dried
marijuana leaves.” (At pp. 7-8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
