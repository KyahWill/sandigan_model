The controversy in this case is between an uncle, respondent SANTIAGO 
Tero, and his nephews and niece, petitioners FELIX Tero, et al, the 
children of his brother SIMEON Tero.  It would appear that the parents 
of SANTIAGO and SIMEON were FAUSTO Tero and Gabriela Pacaldo.  The 
subject of the litigation is the ownership of a parcel of land of about 
1.3610 hectares (hereinafter referred to as the PROPERTY) situated in 
Isabel (formerly Merida), Leyte.  It is in this town that the Government
 has recently established the country's first and only copper smelter.
<p>
The contending parties are agreed that the PROPERTY was originally owned
 by Felipe Juegos.  The claim of FELIX (the name includes his brothers 
and sister as the context may indicate) is based on Exhibit "D", an 
official AFFIDAVIT OF TRANSFER OF REAL PROPERTY (Provincial Form No. 9),
 dated March 15, 1917, which contains a BUYER'S AFFIDAVIT, subscribed by
 SIMEON to the effect that he had bought the PROPERTY from Felipe 
Juegos, and a SELLER'S AFFIDAVIT, subscribed by the said Felipe Juegos 
to the effect that he had sold the PROPERTY to SIMEON.  Said Exhibit "D"
 is the only solid evidence in this case.  SIMEON, in 1917, declared the
 PROPERTY as his in Tax Declaration No. 1423.  When SIMEON died in 1944,
 the PROPERTY became <em>owned in common</em> by his children; that is by FELIX and his brothers and sister.
</p><p>
The claim, of SANTIAGO is based on Exhibit "2", an unsigned affidavit of
 Magdalena Tero, then a widow, dated November 6, 1953.  In that 
affidavit, it was stated that in 1927 Magdalena and her husband, Pedro 
Amodia, became the <em>mortgagees </em>of the PROPERTY for the sum of P40.00, through a <em>verbal</em>
 contract in their favor made by FAUSTO and his wife who had purchased 
said PROPERTY from Felipe Juegos; that, after the death of FAUSTO, 
SANTIAGO, <em>in representation of his brothers and sisters</em>, as heirs of FAUSTO, had wanted to redeem the PROPERTY <em>now</em>
 (that is, in November, 1953); that the mortgage right had already been 
transferred to Cristeta Amodia, the daughter of Magdalena, who had 
subsequently sold the PROPERTY to Benjamin Amodia; and that SANTIAGO 
could still redeem the PROPERTY by paying the mortgage debt of P40.00, 
presumably to her or to Cristeta, but not to Benjamin.
</p><p>
On the basis of the above-stated facts alone, there can be no question 
but that FELIX and his brothers and sister should be declared the owners
 of the PROPERTY.  The affidavit of Magdalena Tero, even if confirmed by
 her oral testimony (but which was not given on the witness stand), 
cannot defeat the AFFIDAVIT OF TRANSFER OF REAL PROPERTY, Exhibit "D".  
For one thing, FAUSTO, not being the owner, could not have mortgaged the
 PROPERTY to Magdalena and her husband.  In 1927, as now, there could 
not be an oral mortgage.
</p><p>
What has to be determined is whether or not after FELIX became the owner
 of the property in 1944, events transpired such that dominion over the 
PROPERTY has to be deemed to have vested in SANTIAGO.  Those events, 
which can be taken into account, are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.   On January 18, 1953, even before the alleged execution of the
 affidavit of Magdalena Tero on November 6, 1953, SANTIAGO declared the 
PROPERTY as belonging to him through Tax Declaration No. 4301 (Exhibit 
"1").  In said Tax Declaration, it was stated by the assessor that he 
inspected the PROPERTY on November 18, 1953 and found that it had not 
been previously declared for taxation, thus ig­noring Tax Declaration 
1423 in the name of SIMEON. </p>
  <p> 2.   As previously stated, SANTIAGO has based his claim to 
ownership of the PROPERTY on the execution on November 6, 1953 of the 
alleged affidavit of Magdalena Tero (Exhibit "2").  What may be pointed 
out is that, according to the affidavit itself, SANTIAGO had approached 
Magdalena Tero <em>"in representation of his brothers and sisters",</em> "the heirs or legitimate children of FAUSTO".  FELIX has to be included among those heirs. </p>
  <p>
    3.   On August 6, 1957, Felipe Amodia and Benjamin Amodia, claiming 
to be owners of the PROPERTY, filed suit against SANTIAGO and FELIX and 
prayed that they, Felipe Amodia and Benjamin Amodia, be declared the 
absolute owners of the PROPERTY (hereinafter referred to as the AMODIA 
SUIT).  This case was apparently instituted because, as stated in the 
affidavit of Magdalena Tero, her daughter Cristeta Amodia had sold the 
PROPERTY to Benjamin Amodia.
  </p>
  <p> 4.   On August 18, 1958, Hermogenes Bazarte and Leode­gario Denoy 
declared the PROPERTY as belonging to them in Tax Declaration No. 4642 
(Exhibit "P"). </p>
  <p> 5.   On January 22, 1959, the AMODIA SUIT was decided on a 
compromise agreement wherein it was stated that SANTIAGO and FELIX "are 
now the absolute and true owners and possessors of the land" (Exhibit 
"5"). </p>
  <p> 6.   On November 13, 1973, FELIX commenced a suit for forcible 
entry against SANTIAGO before the Municipal Court of Isabel (the 
FORCIBLE ENTRY CASE).  On January 31, 1974, the Municipal Court 
dismissed the case after finding that SANTIAGO "is in actual, continuous
 and physical possession of the subject matter of this litigation prior 
to January 22, 1959 up to the present time". </p>
  <p>
    7.   FELIX appealed from the decision of the Municipal Court to the 
Court of First Instance of Leyte.  On March 25, 1974, FELIX filed a 
Complaint before the Court of First Instance of Leyte against SANTIAGO 
for quieting of title with the principal prayer that FELIX be declared 
the owner of the PROPERTY (the TITLE CASE).
  </p>
  <p> 8.   Three (3) days after March 25, 1974, or on March 28, 1974, 
the Court of First Instance dismissed the appeal in the FORCIBLE ENTRY 
CASE, disregarding a plea that the said case be considered jointly with 
the TITLE CASE pre­viously filed on March 25, 1974. </p>
  <p> 9.   On July 24, 1974, the TITLE CASE was decided against FELIX, 
with the Trial Court stating that "as early as 1950, defendant has 
declared the land for taxation pur­poses". </p>
  <p>
    10.   The decision of the Trial Court in the TITLE CASE was appealed
 to the then Court of Appeals which, in 1980, affirmed the decision of 
the Trial Court, stating, <em>inter alia</em>, that:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "On the other hand, ordinary acquisitive prescription of 
immovables and other real rights thru adverse possession of ten years 
requires possession 'in good faith and with just title for the time 
fixed by law' (Negrete vs. Court of First Instance of Marinduque, 
L-31267, Nov. 24, 1972, 48 SCRA 113).  The parcel of land in question 
was possessed by appellee in the concept of owner, openly, publicly and 
adversely against the whole world since he acquired the same from 
Benjamin Amodia who in turn bought it from Cristeta Amodia.  The latter 
also got the property as her share in the inheritance from her mother 
Magdalena Tero, who was in possession thereof as owner, openly and 
adversely.  It is clear, therefore, that appellee acquired possession 
and ownership of the property in question through acquisitive 
prescription."
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is our opinion that the events which had trans­pired after 1944 as 
mentioned above have not vested title to the PROPERTY in SANTIAGO.  
Article 712 of the Civil Code provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "ART. 712.  Ownership is acquired by occupation and by intellectual creation. </p>
  <p> "Ownership and other real rights over property are acquired and 
transmitted by law, by donation, by testate and intestate succession, 
and in consequence of certain contracts, by tradition. </p>
  <p> They may also be acquired by means of presciption."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The only way SANTIAGO could have acquired title to the PROPERTY is 
through prescription, the mode sustained by the Appellate Court.  We 
find its conclusion untenable.
</p><p>
Under Article 117 of the Civil Code, SANTIAGO's possession of the 
PROPERTY, if he was indeed ever in possession, was not in good faith and
 with just title.  On January 18, 1953, he had already claimed that he 
was the owner of the PROPERTY, that is, before he had allegedly redeemed
 the PROPERTY from Magdalena Tero or Cristeta Amodia after Novem­ber 6, 
1953.  Further, it cannot be assumed, under Article 1127, that SANTIAGO 
had "reasonable belief that the person from whom he received the thing 
was the owner thereof, and could transmit his ownership".  On the very 
face of the al­leged affidavit of Magdalena Tero, it appears that she 
was only a mortgagee and, hence, was not the owner and could not 
transmit the ownership of the PROPERTY.  Lastly, Magdalena's affidavit, 
Exhibit "2", not having been signed, and Magdalena not having confirmed 
the affidavit in testimony before the Trial Court, it could not even be 
presumed that there was a grantor to SANTIAGO under Article 1129.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
SANTIAGO's possession was not peaceful and continuous.  Not peaceful 
because it was questioned in the AMODIA SUIT during the period August 6,
 1957 to January 22, 1959.  Then, in his Motion of September 17, 1974 
for execution of judg­ment pending appeal, SANTIAGO said, he "has been 
deprived of the possession and enjoyment of the property" "for quite a 
considerable length of time".  We have also looked at the pictures 
Exhibits "D", "E" and "F", taken on June 4, 1974, of three (3) houses 
standing on the PROPERTY, and have found them to be houses apparently 
constructed long before the mentioned date of June 4, 1974.  Verily, it 
is not clear that SANTIAGO had been in possession of the PROPERTY for 
the total prescriptive period of ten (10) years.
</p><p>
The lower Courts have not viewed SANTIAGO's claim to title over the 
PROPERTY as a claim of one co-owner against the other co-owners.  When 
SANTIAGO redeemed the property from Cristeta Amodia or from Benjamin 
Amodia, he did so in representation of the heirs of FAUSTO, FELIX among 
them.  Even giving substance to the claim of SANTIAGO, it has to be held
 that, through the redemption, he became only a co-owner.  In the 
compromise agreement in the AMODIA SUIT, SANTIAGO also acknowledged that
 he and FELIX were co-owners of the PROPERTY. "No prescription shall run
 in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against his co-owners or co-heirs so 
long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes the co-ownership".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  The only time it can be assumed that SANTIAGO had denounced the 
co-ownership was when he filed an Answer on November 16, 1973 in the 
FORCIBLE ENTRY CASE (Exhibit "8").
