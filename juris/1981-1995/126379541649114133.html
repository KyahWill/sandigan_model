<p>The accused-appellant was charged in the Regional Trial Court of Masbate with 
the murder of Ricardo Rojas and the attempted murder of Romana Rojas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> After a joint trial of the two cases, he 
was convicted of both offenses in a decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> he now asks us to reverse on the ground of 
insufficiency of the evidence against him.<br><br>That evidence consists mainly 
of the testimony of two alleged eyewitnesses to the crimes and of another 
witness who corroborated the former.&nbsp; For his part, the accused-appellant 
offered the defense of denial and presented his own witnesses to support 
him.<br><br>According to Deolinda Rojas, daughter-in-law of the victims, the 
accused-appellant suddenly barged into their store in the early morning of 
December 12, 1981, and upon seeing him, Romana Rojas immediately shouted in 
warning, "Ricardo evitar!" Thereupon, Delavin pointed the gun he was carrying at 
Romana and pulled the trigger four times, but luckily the gun did not fire.&nbsp; 
Ricardo Rojas then appeared and asked, "What is that?" The accused-appellant&nbsp; 
immediately shot him, hitting him in the right upper side of his body and (as 
the autopsy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> later revealed) instantly 
killing him.&nbsp; Delavin then turned on Deolinda, but she had the presence of mind 
to throw at him some empty bottles that were at hand and then to run upstairs 
and escape through the rooftop.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>This testimony was corroborated by 
the widow, Romana, who added that when Delavin entered their store at about 4:30 
o'clock that morning, he shouted, "Where are you, I will kill you all" and that 
when he pointed the gun at her and squeezed the trigger he also said, "I will 
kill you."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> After the shooting of her 
husband, she hid herself while Delavin pursued Deolinda who, fortunately, was 
able to escape.&nbsp; Like Deolinda, the widow said she recognized the 
accused-appellant because they had known him for seven years and they could 
identify him that tragic morning because the store was lighted by a Petromax 
lamp and two kerosene lamps.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Artemio Deocariza, Jr. did not 
witness the shooting but merely heard a gunshot from his house which was about 
fifteen meters away from the Rojas store.&nbsp; He said that when he later went down 
to the store he saw Ricardo Rojas lying on the floor.&nbsp; He said he also saw 
Delavin then, with a gun and walking toward a house of one of the neighbors, but 
later, he affirmed his earlier affidavit and said he saw Delavin aiming his gun 
at the head of Ricardo Rojas when the latter was already prostrate on the cement 
floor of the store.&nbsp; He further declared that the day before the incident, he 
saw the accused-appellant pointing his gun at Ricardo Rojas and at his 
store.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The court rejects the 
testimony of this last witness as immaterial and self-contradictory, not to say 
inconclusive.<br><br>We also rebuff the accused-appellant's denial as, apart 
from the fact that it cannot stand as against the forthright testimony of the 
prosecution eyewitnesses, the tale he tells is inherently improbable and was 
most likely contrived.&nbsp; He says he heard a gunshot from the direction of the 
Rojas store and then a woman screaming and shouting inside the place, which was 
only about twelve to fifteen meters away from his house.&nbsp; Three minutes later he 
left his house to proceed to the pier where he was to take the motor launch to 
Manila.&nbsp; On the way, he saw Deocariza and his father looking at the Rojas store, 
but it did not occur to him to ask what had happened or to go to the place and 
see for himself.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Unnaturally, his 
curiosity was not at all aroused by the unusual sounds.&nbsp; His attitude was one of 
supreme indifference.&nbsp; A gunshot, screams and shouting at the house of a 
neighbor left him completely cold.&nbsp; It is also significant that when one week 
later his wife informed him by long-distance telephone that he was suspected of 
the killing, he nevertheless remained in Manila — possibly to hide — until he 
was finally arrested and brought back to Masbate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The trial court correctly 
disbelieved the testimony of defense witness Aproniano Villamor, who declared 
that the killer was not Delavin but another person, a mysterious stranger he met 
coming from the Rojas house on that fateful morning who pointed a gun at him and 
thereafter "fled toward the hill of Tara Street."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Commenting on his testimony, the trial 
judge observed:&nbsp; "Aproniano Villamor, who claims to have seen the real assassin 
did not even reveal this matter to any one in the market after the incident in 
the pier where he was working at the time, and to any one in Mobo, Masbate, when 
he went home on the same day, nor to any police authorities.&nbsp; It is said that 'a 
witness who keeps silent is incredible.' (People v. Madarang, 31 SCRA 148)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The trial judge had the 
opportunity to observe the witnesses personally and to determine by his own 
firsthand impressions the credibility of their testimony as indicated by their 
demeanor on the stand, the forthrightness of their declarations, the shades of 
tone and word and pause drawing the line between fact and fabrication.&nbsp; We 
sustain his findings on this matter, there being no showing that he has abused 
his discretion or had no basis for his conclusions.&nbsp; And while it is true that, 
as pointed out by the defense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> there 
are a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimony of the 
prosecution witnesses, we agree that these lapses are only on minor details that 
do not detract from, but in fact, by their very imperfection, strengthen its 
veracity.<br><br>There is, of course, no need to prove motive where the culprit 
has been positively identified by eyewitnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> But in any event, for whatever it may be 
worth, evidence was also adduced showing that Delavin harbored resentments 
against the victims because they had refused to extend him a loan of 
P10,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Treachery attended 
the commission of both offenses as there was a sudden and unexpected attack that 
rendered the victims unable to defend themselves.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> "The killing is qualified with treachery 
when the shooting was sudden and unexpected and the victims were not in a 
position to defend themselves."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The 
sudden and unexpected attack was also deliberate.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> In the case of the attempted murder, the 
intent to kill was amply established by Delavin himself when he said, "I will 
kill you" as he squeezed the trigger.&nbsp; Correctly, evident premeditation, not 
having been proved, was not appreciated.<br><br>We sustain the lower court on 
the civil damages due, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>"It was established in this case that at the time of the death of 
the victim, he was 50 years old and engaged in business where he derived a 
monthly income of P10,000.00.&nbsp; As a result of his death, the family lost their 
business.&nbsp; Taking the average span of life of a Filipino, he may be expected to 
live for six (6) years more.&nbsp; (<em>Merchan vs. Mendoza</em>, 24 SCRA 888) The 
yearly income of the deceased is around P120,000.00, less expenses necessary in 
the creation of such earnings or income and less living and other incidental 
expenses in amount of P60,000.00, thus, his yearly net income is P60,000.00 
multiplied by 6 years, the heirs of the deceased should be entitled to the loss 
of earning capacity in the amount of P360,000.00 pursuant to Article 2202, in 
relation to Articles 2205 and 2206, New Civil Code, and <em>People vs. 
Pentola</em>, 25 SCRA 468."
<p></p></blockquote>and on the dispositive portion of the decision reading as 
follows:
<p></p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder in Crim. Case No. 3813 and hereby 
sentences him to a penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the 
heirs of the deceased in the amount of P30,000.00; moral damages loss of earning 
in the amount of P360,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of 
insolvency, together with all the accessory penalties provided for by law, and 
to pay the costs.&nbsp; In Crim. Case No.3814, the Court finds the accused guilty 
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of attempted Murder and hereby sentences 
him to an indeterminate penalty of TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS of <em>prision 
correccional</em> as minimum, to SIX (6) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY of <em>prision 
mayor</em> as maximum, together with all the accessory penalties provided for by 
law, and to pay the costs."
<p></p></blockquote>One of the arguments invoked by the defense was that the 
accused-appellant, knowing that he could easily be identified, would not have 
committed the offenses openly but would have chosen a more subdued place and 
hour to prevent his discovery.&nbsp; In reply, the Solicitor General says:&nbsp; "Time has 
changed a great deal.&nbsp; The brazenness with which crimes are committed in broad 
daylight are too numerous to be recounted." We agree, with not a little sense of 
sadness.&nbsp; Vanished, indeed, are those gentler yesterdays when one's neighbor 
was, as certain as the break of dawn, a 
friend.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appealed decision is affirmed 
<em>in toto</em>, with costs against the accused-appellant.<br><br><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.
