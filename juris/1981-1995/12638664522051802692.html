<p class="BODY">Petitioners seek to annul the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of
the mortgaged property on <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="8">August 6,
 1979</st1:date> in favor of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) on

the public auction sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
thus maintained that the extrajudicial foreclosure sale being null and void by
virtue of lack of a valid levy, the certificate of sale issued by the

mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An ordinary execution sale is
governed by the pertinent provisions of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rule 68 of the Rules of Court applies in

the other hand, Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118 otherwise known as
"An Act to Regulate the Sale of Property under Special Powers Inserted in

<p class="BODY">The case at bar, as the facts disclose, involves an extrajudicial
