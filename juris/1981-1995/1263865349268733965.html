<p class="BODY">The factual background of this case as found by the trial court
is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The childless couple of <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Adato</span>
were living in a house in their farm outside the barrio proper of <span class="SpellE">Bongliw</span> in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoang</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,

residence consisted of a main structure and a <span class="SpellE"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">camalig</b></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span>attached thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
were allegedly using the annex as their sleeping quarters because the other
portion was in a state of dilapidation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the morning of <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="8">August
 27, 1973</st1:date>, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Adato</span> was found
lifeless in the main house of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> sprawled in her own blood on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was definitely the victim of a foul play,
for it was established that she suffered 16 lesions in different parts of the
body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Evardone</span>, who performed the autopsy in the <st1:place><st1:placename>G.B.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Tan</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
said that the wounds were caused by a sharp-edged instrument like a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ten (10) were chopping wounds while the rest
were incised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctor said that 3 of
these were fatal, 6 were serious and the others were more of less
superficial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shown to be mortal
were:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) a chopping wound, 10 x 5 cm. at
the based of the neck, left side, cutting through a clavicle with the pleural
cavity grazing the upper border of the apex of the left lung; b) a chopping
wound, 26 x 10 cm. at the left chest, cutting through the lateral aspect of the
6th and 7th ribs into the pleural cavity; and c) a chopping wound, left chest,
28 x 10 cm., cutting the 6th and 7th ribs into the pleural cavity and incising
half-way the lower lobe of the left lung (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. “A”
and “A-1”).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The amended information dated <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1973</st1:date>, charging the accused with Parricide
reads as follows:</p>

locally called ‘<span class="SpellE">sondang</span>’ which the said accused had
provided himself for the purpose, thereby inflicting upon the person of

her body which wounds caused the instantaneous death of the latter.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented the following witnesses whose
testimonies, as culled from and summarized by the trial court in its decision,
are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(1) <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>) <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, a farmer residing in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bongliw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
stated that he and his wife were awakened from their sleep in the <span class="SpellE"><b>camalig</b></span> by the barking of their dog in the early
morning of <st1:date year="1973" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He peeped through the <span class="SpellE"><b>nipa</b></span>
wall and saw <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> coming to his house with a bolo
in one hand and a torch in the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> entered the <span class="SpellE"><b>camalig</b></span>
and shouted:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>,
where are you now?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let’s fight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let’s join our belts and intestine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I will kill both of you.” Standing on sawed
lumber in the <span class="SpellE"><b>camalig</b></span>, the accused allegedly
continued swinging his bolo in the direction of the sleeping quarters and hit
the finger and wrist of <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> kicked the
accused but was in turn hit on the right foot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To defend himself, <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> got his bolo and
swung it against <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> who was hit on the
forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused put down the torch
enabling <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> to jump down passing at the back,
and, with his wife who had escaped earlier, crossed the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>
to the direction of the house of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
and Luciana <span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon his call, the <span class="SpellE">Baluyots</span> let them in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They stayed there until morning when <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, accom­panied by barrio councilman <span class="SpellE">Narding</span> <span class="SpellE">Acedera</span>, went to town to
have his wounds treated in the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> also testified that <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> did not pursue them to the house of
Luciana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With his torch burning, the
accused returned and went around the dilapidated house several times before
placing the light in the yard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> got the torch and moved to the direction of the
house of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Irinco</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Decision, Criminal Case No. 388; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 20-21; TSN, Hearing, Dec. 13, 1973, pp. 1-111).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(2) Luciana <span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span>, also a resident of <span class="SpellE">Bongliw</span>,
<st1:place>Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, declared that
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o’clock</st1:time> that morning, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Primitivo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> and
his wife called at their house and requested to be taken in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw that <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
was wounded in the right hand and in the foot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She washed his wounds with alcohol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While taking a piece of cloth to be used as bandage, Luciana narrated,
she heard Victoria <span class="SpellE">Adato</span> shrieking in the direction
of the house of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She noted that <st1:state><st1:place>Victoria</st1:place></st1:state>’s
voice was alarming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luciana became
apprehensive and after giving the cloth to <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>
went up again and looked out of the window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She noticed that there was a light under <span class="SpellE">Primitivo’s</span>
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The torch went around the house
and then proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> where it later
disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following morning, she
learned that <st1:state><st1:place>Victoria</st1:place></st1:state> was found
dead in the house of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Ibid</u>; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

a resi­dent of the same place, about 100 meters from the house of the accused,
declared that somebody challenged him from the doorway that morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He recognized the challenger to be <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> who told
him:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“If you are really brave, come
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I’ll kill you!” Surprised, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> did not move at once.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> broke the <span class="SpellE"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

inside and said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Where are you
now?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You will be the second.” <span class="SpellE">Dicdic</span> bundled his two children and with his wife ran out
passing through the kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They went
to the residence of Tito <span class="SpellE">Acedera</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he returned after lunch, <span class="SpellE">Dicdic</span> found a bolo beneath his kitchen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He noticed that the weapon was stained with
blood and that several strands of hair were attached to it, which he believed
to have come from the head of a woman considering the length.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> inserted the
bolo in a 4-year-old coconut palm in his yard where it laid until he gave it to
a police posse that called several days later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<u>Ibid</u>; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 21-22; TSN; Hearing,
Jan. 31. 1974, pp. 248-249).</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(4) <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Ciray</span>, residing by the
bank of the <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span> river, testified that <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> went up their house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o’clock</st1:time> that morning by pushing the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she went out of their room, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> allegedly boxed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She shouted:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“<span class="SpellE">Nanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">nanay</span>,
help!” They held each other and she was stained with his blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Yoyo <span class="SpellE">Adato</span>,
her husband, got up from bed, he held <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> and
they scuffled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span>
had been subdued, Yoyo inquired:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="SpellE">Papay</span>, why are you doing this to us?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are still your nephews.” <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> answered:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“You try to see your <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> because she is
dead.” According to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>, the “<span class="SpellE">mamay</span>” referred to was Victoria <span class="SpellE">Adato</span>,
the aunt of Yoyo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 22; TSN; Hearing, Feb. 1, 1974, p. 277).</p>

saw <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> in
the house of <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The barrio captain of <span class="SpellE">Bongliw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapiad</span>, who was
also there, informed him that a statement of the accused had been taken and
that Victoria <span class="SpellE">Adato</span> was lying dead in a house about
200 meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They went there and saw
her lifeless body on the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He drew
a sketch of the room before bringing the cadaver to town for autopsy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next time, in company of the chief of police,
he drew a sketch of the <span class="SpellE"><b>camalig</b></span> attached to
the house where <st1:state><st1:place>Victoria</st1:place></st1:state> was
found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sketches were marked <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. “B”, “B-1” and “B-2”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On that occasion, they also went to the house of Luciana <span class="SpellE">Baluyot</span> where <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> gave them the bolo he used against <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “E” the bolo
which Emilio <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span> found under his kitchen stairs, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “D” was handed to <span class="SpellE">Cerbito</span> in
his third visit to the barrio.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cerbito</span> declared that when delivered to him, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “D” was still stained with blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid., <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.

that <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> was semi-conscious when brought to
the hospital with two incised wounds in the right side of the head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was a 10 x 1.5 cm. lesion directed <span class="SpellE">antero-posteriorly</span> involving the whole <span class="SpellE">thicknesss</span>
of the scalp and the other was a 4 x 1 cm. directed also <span class="SpellE">antero-posteriorly</span>
above the other one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both were caused by
a sharp-bladed instrument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctor
opined that only moderate force was employed (Decision, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 388).</p>

<p class="BODY">Among others, the doctor indicated in the sketch the exact
location of the wounds stated in the autopsy report and testified that more
wounds were sustained by the victim on the left side of her body from the left
arm going up to the base of the neck, left side, all slash or chopping wounds
involving the front and the back but more in front.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctor further testified that it is
possible that the assailant was standing at the back of the victim if he was
right handed and if the victim was standing, it is also possible that the
assailant was in front if he is left handed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, he opined that Wound No. 8 located at the left forearm is a
defense wound with the assailant possibly in front and the victim parrying the
blow with her left forearm (TSN:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hearing, Dec. 12, 1973, pp. 317-324).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor further stated that about nine (9) wounds cut through some
hard bones and opined that to inflict these wounds, an ordinary person of
average health must have exerted much effort (<u>Ibid</u>.; TSN, pp. 326-327).</p>

He drank the <b>tuba</b> alone at first but he left and returned later with a
companion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to her, <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> stated that he is drinking because he has a sort

spouses, <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> and Victoria, who are trying to
encroach on their boundary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> said, “I will kill them.” The witness cautioned <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> to keep quiet because they were near the police

at the suggestion of his wife to see the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> lighted a

</span>The witness (<span class="SpellE">Deguia</span>) was by the window and the

him, he heard <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> saying, “What are you doing
there ‘<span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>’” and then he saw <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>) slashed <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> at
the head two times using the left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

after which the witness heard her shouting for help because she was being
killed by <span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her voice was coming from the direction of the house of <span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span> which was twenty (20) meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he heard the sound, he was frightened

allegedly answered that “We have a fight with <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span>

arrived with a <span class="SpellE">banca</span>, she boarded the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and headed for <span class="SpellE">Tarusan</span>

residence in the early morning of August 27, 1973 because the accused was there
and was wounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that he took

a teacher, who took down the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> answers on
paper which was later <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by the latter
before the same was given to the Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span>

that he gave said statement to the Chief of Police (Hearing of March 19, 1974;

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the then Court of First Instance of Northern <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> found the accused-appellant guilty of
the crime charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of the said decision, reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Premises considered, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Valentin</span> <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> guilty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the crime of Parricide beyond

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused-appellant relies on a single assignment
of error, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>THAT THE LOWER COURT
ERRED IN CON­VICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT MERELY ON THE BASIS OF WRONG AND
WEAK INFERENCES.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant appeal is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no eyewitness to the crime of parricide supposed to have
been committed by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
positive and direct evidence was introduced to show who killed the victim who
sustained sixteen (16) chopping and incised wounds, inside the house of <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecu­tion rested its case against the
accused-appellant on the basis of merely circumstantial evidence (Brief for
Accused-­<span class="SpellE">Appelant</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 73; Decision, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 388; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 98).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the version of the prosecution more credible, the trial
court convicted the accused of the crime charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic that conclusions and findings of fact by the
trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed
unless for strong and cogent reasons (Chase v. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>
Sr., 136 SCRA 365 [1985]; People v. Cruz, Sr., 151 SCRA 609 [1987]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Acelajado</span>, 148 SCRA 142 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">But while it is the established rule that appellate courts will
not generally disturb the factual findings of the trial court, considering that
it is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses
themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during the
trial, this does not apply where the lower court overlooked certain facts of
substance and value which if considered, would affect the result of the case
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Royeras</span>, 130 SCRA 259 [1984]; People v.
Martinez, 144 SCRA 303 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The exceptions, therefore, to the rule on conclusiveness of trial
court findings, are, among others:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impos­sible and that the
judgment is based on misapprehension of facts (People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 50
[1986]; People v. Canada, 144 SCRA 121 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, where a careful review of the records shows some
misapprehension of facts, findings actually grounded not on what transpired,
but conjectures about what transpired, and other discrepancies, this Court held
that the appeal must be granted and the accused-appellant acquitted (People v.
Ale, <u>supra</u>, p. 57).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the following conjectures and misapprehension
of facts are noted:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

10.0pt;font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution would have this Court believe that the accused on
that fatal morning, went on a rampage, chal­lenging his neighbors for no
apparent reason and failing to kill any of them, he vent his ire on his hapless
wife and brutally killed her.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed, however, that neither the prosecution nor
the defense made any serious attempt to show that the accused was suffering
from a mental ailment at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the time
preceding the act or at the moment of its execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the trial court made it of record
that it is not aware of the condition of the mind of the accused, so that for
all legal intents, the latter was considered sane and that he acted in his
ordinary state of mind (Deci­sion, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.
388; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 103).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither was it shown that the accused had a quarrel with his wife
before or during the incident, nor was she included among those the accused
allegedly challenged in that incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the harmonious relationship between husband and wife
has never been put in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As shown
by the records, the deceased exhibiting an intense wifely concern, went down
from their house and followed her husband whom she obviously knew was in
danger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, on his part, was
shown by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Giray</span>, a prosecution witness, to have asked her to see her <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span> (his wife), before he collapsed in the house of the
witness due to his wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
violent action which ended the life of the deceased cannot by any stretch of
the imagination be alluded to the accused who has not been shown to have any
complaint against his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, from the testimony of the prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, to the effect
that the accused barged in his <span class="SpellE"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

</span>Let us fight...” can be reasonably implied that there was a previous
encounter between the accused and <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, followed
by a hot pursuit by the accused, giving credence to the version of the defense
that the accused went down at 3:00 o’clock that morning of the inci­dent to
check on his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> and while he was passing the
toilet of his house, he was slashed on the head by an assailant, said to be <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:23.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, in the offer of the statement of the accused allegedly
taken by the Chief of Police in the investiga­tion he conducted in his office,
as evidence both by the prosecution and by the defense, the prosecution
admitted that it is very clear that the accused was slashed by somebody<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> in the toilet, although it was not prepared
to agree that it was <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>
who did it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, it is
evident that the accused was already slashed and wounded before he proceeded to
the <span class="SpellE"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">camalig</b></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>of <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>,

admit the aforementioned statement of the accused as indicative of the latter’s

killing of his wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the trial

his wife, in challenging <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>
and Yoyo and in boxing <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> had been provided by
the accused himself in his statement that he was like a “<span class="SpellE">juramentado</span>”

opportunity to explain his statement before it was used against him, nor was it
shown that he was assisted by counsel when he made the same.</p>

destroyed their door and went up, but I could not slash <span class="SpellE">Dikdik</span>,
because he jumped out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then I went
direct to their kitchen and as I was going down, I fell and my bolo was lost
which I tried to search by touching the ground, but I could not find it because
it was dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After that I went to the
house of Yoyo <span class="SpellE">Adato</span> and when I arrived there, I also
challenged him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Due to my anger and even
if he was the nephew of my wife, I pushed also their door and entered and boxed
<span class="SpellE">Dading</span>, wife of Yoyo, then I grappled with Yoyo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said, ‘What is this, <span class="SpellE">Papay</span>,
I am your nephew, you are fighting me?’ But I said, ‘Because you are debtors,
you do not pay your debts.’ But I said, never mind that, you look after your <span class="SpellE">Mamay</span>, because she is there dead, I was slashed by <span class="SpellE">Tiboy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After that I

standing grievance against the people he was supposed to have challenged in
that incident, such as: <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, for having slashed
him; <span class="SpellE">Irineo</span>, for stealing his coconuts; and Yoyo, for
not paying his debts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But at no instance
was it shown that the accused challenged his wife, berated her, or gave vent to
his anger on her after <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> escaped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without proof of these facts, there a number
of important missing links in the chain of circumstances which raise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">grave doubts as to the culpability of the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than that, the records
show that aside from the superficial wounds he allegedly inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, as well as the fact that he boxed <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>, he did not harm anyone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, no logical reason could be

the deceased coming from the house of <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On ocular inspection, said house was
established to be 235 meters away from her house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that because of the silence of
the place at 3:00 o’clock in the morning, the trial court is correct in finding
that the distressed cry could be distinctly heard, it is hardly persuasive that
at such distance it is possible to identify the voice that must have
considerably changed under the circumstances and which as testified by the
witness “the sound was almost bad.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, Luciana testified that there is no house at the back
of her house (Hearing, January 30, 1974, TSN, p. 120), when in fact during the
ocular inspection, it was clearly observed that “there is a house at the back
of her big house” (Hearing, Feb. 6, 1974, TSN, p. 3) which in fact obstructed
the view from her to the <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> and across to the
far houses of <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it is equally probable that it was accused who uttered the
distress cry when he came upon the body of his dead wife.</p>

circumstance favoring the innocence of an accused must be duly taken into
account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proof against him must
survive the test of reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspicion

the prosecution witnesses are inconsistent on material points, they are based
on surmises and conjectures which have no basis on proven facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than that, there is an obvious attempt
to suppress evidence as shown by the loss of the statement of the accused taken

fact that the statement of the accused in his affidavit was interpreted out of

giving way to a conjecture consistent with guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relative thereto, this Court ruled:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“If the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
facts and circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which
is consistent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with the innocence of the

affidavit and in his statement which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was
</span>confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Lapiad</span>,
a barrio captain who took said statement and <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Adora</span>, a public school teacher who wrote them down.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court discredited the testimony of Felipe <span class="SpellE">Deguia</span>, a 63-year-old woodcutter, for his failure to
identify <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Deguia’s</span>
testimony was based on facts that actually happened such as:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the accused went down at 3:00
o’clock in the morning of that fatal day; (b) that the accused was slashed on
the head by <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> who admitted the slashing
although on a different place; (c) that <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>
challenged the <span class="SpellE">Salangoste</span> spouses to come to his
house because he will finish them; (d) that the deceased cries for help because
she was being killed by <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> came from the house
of the latter; and (e) that she was in fact found dead in said house of <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While such
testimony cannot be used to convict <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span>, it none­theless
threw light in an otherwise <span class="SpellE">bemuddled</span> situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than that, it cannot be denied that the
circumstances narrated are more consistent with simple logic and more in accord
with the ordinary course of human experience than those presented by the
prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Deguia</span> established as a fact that the
accused who was slashed and wounded by <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> before
entering the <span class="SpellE"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">camalig</b></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>of the latter was behaving like any
normal person in search for the enemy who had wounded him and not one who ran
amuck, mad enough <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>kill his
own wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is already well established that “the testimony of
witness may be believed in part and disbelieved in part, depending upon the
corroborative evidence and the proba­bilities and improbabilities of the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court may accept such of the
witness’ testimony as it may deem proper notwithstanding his false
statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If parts of a witness’
testimony is found true, it cannot be disregarded entirely” (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacabes</span>, 137 SCRA 159 [1985]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the trial court found the testimony of Elena <span class="SpellE">Tepace</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tomasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Acuin</span> as incredulous and untrust­worthy, finding it hard to
believe that <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> would broad­cast his intention
to kill within the hearing distance of <span class="SpellE">Tepace</span> or that
upon slaying two of his neighbors should nonchalantly give the information he
would ordinarily with­hold when not drunk.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Acuin</span> is not just a
passing ac­quaintance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As established at
the hearing, <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> is her nephew-in-law and there
is nothing wrong or unusual for the latter to confide to her whom he can reasonably
believe would not testify against him because of their relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally on rebuttal, <span class="SpellE">Basarte</span> could not
show any motive why said witnesses would testify against him except again on
the basis of another conjecture that they have been paid (Hearing, March 26,
1974, TSN, pp. 474-480).</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the fact that the financial condition of the accused
would not support such supposition, the fact that said witnesses have been
paid, have never been proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as
it may, the Supreme court is not neces­sarily bound by the credibility which
the trial court attaches to a particular witness (People v. Burgos, 144 SCRA 1
[1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, it is an established precept that “when the evidence
for the prosecution and the evidences for the accused are weighed, the scales
must be tipped in favor of the accused.” (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pecardal</span>,
145 SCRA 647 [1986]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Circumstantial
evidence as a basis for conviction of crime should be acted on and weighed with
great caution, particularly when the crime is heinous x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.” (People v. <span class="SpellE">Jara</span>, 144
SCRA 516 [1986]), as “our jurisprudence is built around the concept that it is
prefer­able for the guilty to remain unpunished than for an innocent person to
suffer a long prison term unjustly.” (People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span>,
136 SCRA 74 [1985]; People v. Ale, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
