<st1:place><st1:placetype>Mt.</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
there was a communal land called the <span class="SpellE">tayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was owned by the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>

The sale was made in favor of Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>, whose
house had been built thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deed of sale states that sale was made in consideration of

<p class="BODY">According to Jessie, he was with his cousin Leonard munching
sugarcane inside the granary while their grandfather Edward was out hunting and
their grandmother was in <span class="SpellE">Colayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he saw his aunt, <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span>

Three days later, the police filed a complaint for theft against <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span> in the Municipal

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span>

of <span class="SpellE">Jakot</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accused was one of them but she did not declare the land for taxation
purposes because no one in the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span> was allowed to
declare the land as his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
any member of the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span> could make improvements on

died, his widow <span class="SpellE">Pidchoy</span> and their children continued
cultivating the land. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>They also built a
granary thereon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> The
land was later given to <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> by <span class="SpellE">Pidchoy</span>
for cultivation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the family
allowed Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span> to build a house behind the
place where <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> and her family used to have a house

helped each other in farm work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one
had ever prevented them from cutting the sugarcane and the other plants except
in one instance when <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>,
the son of Edward, cut some of her banana plants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> sued him as a

it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew that the sugarcane was
planted by <span class="SpellE">Erkey's</span> father but the bananas were
planted by <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> and her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fangki</span> was one of <span class="SpellE">Erkey's</span> <span class="SpellE">barriomates</span> who helped
her cut the allegedly stolen sugarcane.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal trial court discredited <span class="SpellE">Erkey's</span>
story emphasizing that her claim of continuous occupation and possession of the
land was baseless as she had "no papers to show" or prove such claim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It found that all the elements of theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal
Code were present and accordingly rendered the aforementioned judgment of
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Mountain</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place>
affirmed the municipal trial court and held:</p>

<blockquote>"From the above facts gathered by this court, the following
conclusions had been made x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the claim of complainant over the land
where the plants (sugarcane and bananas) were supposedly located, is more
credible considering that complainant’s claim of ownership over the land and
naturally the plants thereon is documented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span>
"A” is a public document, a Deed of Conveyance, showing the transfer of
the lot where the plants in question are located to complainant Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span> by one <span class="SpellE">Pel-ey</span> <span class="SpellE">Cullalad</span>, allegedly the eldest of the '<span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>'
group who are the owners of the land in dispute, and witnessed by most if not
all the members or the '<span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even accused herself admits that those
involved in the sale are indeed heirs and members of the '<span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>';
and as testified to by <span class="SpellE">Pel-ey</span> <span class="SpellE">Cullalad</span>,
the sale of the area in question was made in favor of complainant, following
the decision of the ‘<span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>’ group due to the long
occupation of the area and the improvements such as the house, the fence and
the plants introduced by complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, complainant's possession over the property is also
constructively supported by his tax declarations marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B" and "C" and his realty tax payment marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “D".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Speaking of tax payments, our Honorable Supreme Court ruled that tax
receipts are strong evidence of possession as no one in his right mind would
pay realty taxes year after year for property not in his actual possession.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, accused does not have a single document to
show her alleged possession of the area in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In spite of the claim of accused that she
occupied the area in dispute for over twenty (20) years, she never declared the
property in her name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this aspect our
Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Cruzado</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bustus</span> and <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span>, 34 Phil. 17,
said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘The failure to declare land for
taxation shows claimant did not believe <span class="GramE">himself</span> to be
owner.’ If the claim of accused has any basis at all, why did she not file
ejection proceedings against complainant, or an action to annul <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Exh</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span>
"A" considering that complainant is not a member of the '<span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>' and that complainant allegedly built his house
without permission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of this, why
did accused allow Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>, the complainant,
to fence the area including the sugarcane, the bananas and the avocado trees if
indeed she and her parents were the ones who planted them?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that the lower courts erred in ruling that <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng's</span> claim over the land was more credible, that the
elements of theft are lacking in this case, and that, inasmuch as there was no
criminal intent on the part of the accused, the instant case is purely civil in
nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Erkey</span>
Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span> filed a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>

<blockquote>"A review of the records clearly shows that private
complainant is a possessor in good faith in concept of an owner over the lot
where the crops in question were planted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As found by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, his claim of ownership is
documented by a Deed of Conveyance (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"A"), a public document which was executed between him and the
members of the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span> group of <span class="SpellE">Arnab</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Mainit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bontoc</span>, Mt.

Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>, (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"D"), although not conclusive proofs of ownership, are, <span class="SpellE">neverthless</span>, <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of his
possession of the land in question, as against petitioner, for, he would not be
paying taxes on the land unless he was in possession thereof and deriving some
benefit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In contrast to <span class="GramE">these</span> documentary evidence,
petitioner offers nothing better than her bare claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused-petitioner next contends that not all the essential
elements of the crime of theft are present in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, it is claimed that criminal
intent on her part has not been established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The personal property
taken by accused-petitioner not being hers but those of Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>, and she gained from the taking thereof without
the consent of the owner, accused-petitioner is guilty of the crime of
theft.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her defense that she owned the
property taken has been shown to be without basis and must have been concocted
by her as it was the only possible defense available to her to avoid criminal
liability for theft."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Her motion for reconsideration having been denied, <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span> filed the instant
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> raising the following issues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether or not there was criminal intent
on the part of the petitioner-accused; (b) whether or not the taking of the
sugarcane was done with intent to gain, and (c) whether or not the present case
is civil or criminal in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court does not re-examine the facts of a case in a petition
for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i> under Rule 45 except for unusual reasons
which would justify otherwise.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
One of these reasons is when certain material facts and circumstances had been
overlooked by the trial court which, if taken into account, would alter the
result of the case in that they would introduce an element of reasonable doubt
which would entitle the accused to acquittal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

effect on this Court of the lower courts factual findings.</p>

taking of personal property; (b) the property belongs to another; (c) the
taking away was done with intent of gain; (d) the taking away was done without
the consent of the owner; and (e) the taking away is accomplished without
violence or intimidation against person or force upon things.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Inasmuch as appellant admits having taken the sugarcane and bananas without
violence or intimidation against person or force upon things, we have to
determine whether it has been proven beyond reasonable doubt that the property
belonged to the complainant and that appellant had intent to gain.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove ownership over the sugarcane and bananas, Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span> relied heavily on his documentary evidence
consisting of the deed of sale, the tax declarations and the receipt evidencing
tax payment for 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A careful study of
these documents, in conjunction with the testimonial evidence extant in the
record, however, discloses matters which put a cloud of doubt upon appellant's
culpability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deed of sale describes the property as containing an area of <u>400</u>
square meters and as bounded on the north by <span class="SpellE">Kedawen</span>
on the south by <span class="SpellE">Kilangan</span> and a foot trail, on the
west by a foot trail and the residential houses of <span class="SpellE">Faryao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Odchanggar</span>, and on the east by <span class="SpellE">Ayochok</span> and <span class="SpellE">Finggay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, tax declarations Nos.
22694 and 23007 show that the property contains an area of <u>512</u> square
meters with the following boundaries:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>north, <span class="SpellE">Lagmay</span> <span class="SpellE">Ayochok</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>east, <span class="SpellE">Sagumay</span> <span class="SpellE">Balani</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>south,
public land (trail); and west, public land (trail).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No where in the record does an explanation on
these disparities appear.</p>

<p class="BODY">These disparities, however, gain significance under the peculiar
circumstances of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case
involved was communal before the sale to Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
being co-owned by the members of the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Anyone, including nonmembers of the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>, could
build a house thereon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the exact location of the area where the allegedly
stolen plants were taken from is concerned, the prosecution presented evidence
that the sugarcane and bananas were planted within Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng’s</span>
yard around three meters from his house;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
that Edward had a granary in his yard "above the place where the
sugarcane" was planted and that <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> also had a
granary above the place where the bananas and sugarcane were planted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> admitted that Edward built
the fence enclosing his house which was “below" her granary<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
and right behind the site of the house of <span class="SpellE">Erkey's</span>
family before they transferred to <span class="SpellE">Arupey</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These testimonies show that the areas cultivated by Edward and <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> were adjacent and so close to each other that the
possibility of confusion as to who planted which plants is not remote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, before the filing of this case, <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> had sued Edward's son, <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>,
who allegedly cut down bananas she had planted in the area.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that Edward had built a fence around the area he claimed as his does
not necessarily prove that he enclosed only the 400 square meters he had
purchased from the <span class="SpellE">tomayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, he had declared as his own for
taxation purposes 112 square meters more than the area he bought.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the definitive identification of the area allegedly
possessed and planted to sugarcane and bananas by Edward <span class="SpellE">Pasiteng</span>
is imperative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is on record a
survey plan of the 512 square-meter areas claimed by Edward<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
but there are no indications therein of the exact area involved in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This omission of the prosecution
to definitively delineate the exact location of the place where <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> allegedly harvested Edward's plants has punctured
what appeared to be its neat presentation of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof on the matter, however, is important
for it means the identification of the rightful owner of the stolen
properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be emphasized that
to prove the crime theft, it is necessary and indispensable to clearly identify
the person who, as a result of a criminal act, without his knowledge and consent,
was wrongfully deprived of a thing belonging to him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We see this case as exemplifying a clash between a claim or
ownership founded on customs and tradition and another such claim supported by
written evidence but nonetheless based on the same customs and tradition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When a court is beset with this kind of case,
it can never be too careful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More so in
this case, where the accused, an illiterate tribeswoman who cannot be expected
to resort to written evidence of ownership, stands to lose her liberty on
account of an oversight in the court's appreciation of the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span> took the sugarcane and bananas believing them to be her
own.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
That being the case, she could not have had a criminal intent.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore not surprising why her counsel believes that this
case is civil and not criminal in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There are indeed legal issues that must be ironed out with regard to
claims of ownership over the <span class="SpellE">tayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But those are matters which should be
threshed out in an appropriate civil action. </p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, appellant <span class="SpellE">Erkey</span> Pit-<span class="SpellE">og</span> is hereby ACQUITTED for lack of proof beyond reasonable
doubt that she committed the crime of theft.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
