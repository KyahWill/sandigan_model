<p class="BODY">We first resolve G.R. No. 84197.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Pioneer Insurance and Surety Corporation <span class="GramE">avers</span> that:</p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRIEVOUSLY ERRED WHEN IT DISMISSED THE
APPEAL OF PETITIONER ON THE SOLE GROUND THAT PETITIONER HAD ALREADY COLLECTED
THE PROCEEDS OF THE REINSURANCE ON ITS BOND IN FAVOR OF THE JDA AND THAT IT
CANNOT REPRESENT A REINSURER TO RECOVER THE AMOUNT FROM HEREIN PRIVATE
RESPONDENTS AS DEFENDANTS IN THE TRIAL COURT.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> - G.R. No. 84197, p. 10)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the following findings of the appellate
court:</p>

<blockquote>"We find no merit in plaintiff's appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that plaintiff Pioneer had
reinsured its risk of liability under the surety bond in favor of JDA and
subsequently collected the proceeds of such reinsurance in the sum of
P295,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants’ alleged
obligation to Pioneer amounts to P295<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, hence,
plaintiff's instant action for the recovery of the amount of P298,666.28 from
defendants will no longer prosper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff Pioneer is not the real party in interest to institute the
instant action as it does not stand to be benefited or injured by the judgment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"Plaintiff Pioneer's
contention that it is representing the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> to
recover the amount from defendants, hence, it instituted the action is utterly
devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff did not even
present any evidence that it is the attorney-in-fact of the reinsurance company,
authorized to institute an action for and in behalf of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To qualify a person to be a real party in
interest in whose name an action must be prosecuted, he must appear to be the
present real owner of the right sought to be enforced (Moran, Vol. I, Comments
on the Rules of Court, 1979 ed., p. 155).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has been held that the real party in interest is the party who would
be benefited or injured by the judgment or the party entitled to the avails of
the suit (<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> v. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd.,
88 Phil. 125, 131).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By real party in
interest is meant a present substantial interest as distinguished from a mere
expectancy or a future, contingent, subordinate or consequential interest
(Garcia v. David, 67 Phil. 27; <span class="SpellE">Oglleaby</span> v.
Springfield Marine Bank, 52 N.E. 2d. 1600, 385 III, 414, Flowers v. <span class="SpellE">Germana</span>, 1 NW 2d 424; Weber v. City of <span class="SpellE">Cheye</span>,
97 P. 2d 667, 669, quoting 47 C.V. 35).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Based on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>foregoing
premises, plaintiff Pioneer cannot be considered as the real party <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>interest as it has already been
paid by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> the sum of P295<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> - the bulk of defendants’ alleged obligation to
Pioneer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In addition to the said proceeds of the reinsurance received
by plaintiff Pioneer from its <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>, the former
was able to foreclose extra-judicially one of the subject airplanes and its
spare engine, realizing the total amount of P37<span class="GramE">,050.00</span>
from the sale of the mortgaged chattels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adding the sum of P37<span class="GramE">,050</span>..00. to the proceeds
of the reinsurance amounting to P295,000.00, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">is </span>patent that plaintiff has been overpaid in the amount of
P33,383.72 considering that the total amount it had paid to JDA totals to only
P298,666.28.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To allow plaintiff Pioneer
to recover from defendants the amount in excess of P298,666.28 would be
tantamount to unjust enrichment as it has already been paid by the reinsurance
company of the amount plaintiff has paid to JDA as surety of defendant Lim <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> defendant Lim's liability to JDA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is the rule that no person
should unjustly enrich himself at the expense of another (Article 22, New Civil
Code)." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> - 84197, pp. 24-25)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that -- (1) it is at a loss where
respondent court based its finding that petitioner was paid by its <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> in the aforesaid amount, as this matter has never
been raised by any of the parties herein both in their answers in the court
below and in their respective briefs with respondent court; (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11) (2) even assuming hypothetically that it was
paid by its <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>, still none of the respondents
had any interest in the matter since the reinsurance is strictly between the
petitioner and the re-insurer pursuant to section 91 of the Insurance Code; (3)
pursuant to the indemnity agreements, the petitioner is entitled to recover
from respondents <span class="SpellE">Bormaheco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maglana</span>;
and (4) the principle of unjust enrichment is not applicable considering that
whatever amount he would recover from the co-<span class="SpellE">indemnitor</span>
will be paid to the <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records belie the petitioner's contention that the issue on
the reinsurance money was never raised by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory reading of the trial court's lengthy decision shows
that two of the issues threshed out were:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx
<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Has</span>
Pioneer a cause of action against defendants with respect to so much of its
obligations to JDA as has been paid with reinsurance money?</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the answer to the
preceding question is in the negative, has Pioneer still any claim against
defendants, considering the amount it has realized from the sale of the
mortgaged properties?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Record on Appeal,
p. 359, Annex B of G.R. No. 84157)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In resolving these issues, the trial court made the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>"It appearing that Pioneer reinsured its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">risk </span>of liability under the surety
bond it had executed in favor of JDA, collected the proceeds of such
reinsurance in the sum of P295<span class="GramE">,000</span>, and paid with the
said amount the bulk of its alleged liability to JDA under the said surety
bond, it is plain that on this score it no longer has any right to collect to
the extent of the said amount.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the question of why it is Pioneer, instead of the reinsurance
(sic), that is suing defendants for the amount paid to it by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>, notwithstanding that the cause of action
pertains to the latter, Pioneer says:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>‘The <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> opted instead that the Pioneer
Insurance &amp; Surety Corporation shall pursue alone the case.’ ‘….Pioneer
Insurance &amp; Surety Corporation is representing the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>
to recover the amount.’ In other words, insofar as the amount paid to it by the
<span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> Pioneer is suing defendants as their
attorney-in-fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But in the first place, there is not the slightest indication in
the complaint that Pioneer is suing as attorney-in-fact of the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> for any amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lastly, and most important of all, Pioneer has no right to institute and
maintain in its own name an action for the benefit of the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that an action brought by
an attorney-in-fact in his own name instead of that of the principal will not
prosper, and this is so even where the name of the principal is disclosed in
the complaint.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“‘Section 2 of Rule 3 of the Old Rules of Court provides that
‘Every action must be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.’
This provision is mandatory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The real
party in interest is the party who would be <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span>
or injured by the judgment or is the party entitled to the avails of the suit.</p>

<p class="2Q">'"This Court has held in various cases that an attorney-in?fact
is not a real party in interest, that there is no law permitting an action to
be brought by an attorney-in-fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

G.R. No. L-22347, 1968, 23 SACRA 706, 710-714.'"</p>

<blockquote>"The total amount paid by Pioneer to JDA is P299<span class="GramE">,666.29</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
Pioneer has collected P295<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>, the uninsured portion of what it paid to JDA is
the difference between the two amounts, or P3,666.28.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the amount for which Pioneer may sue
defendants, assuming that the indemnity agreement is still valid and
effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But since the amount realized
from the sale of the mortgaged chattels are P35<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
for one of the airplanes and P2,050.00 for a spare engine, or a total of
P37,050.00, Pioneer is still overpaid by P33,383.72.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, Pioneer has no more <span class="GramE">claim</span> against defendants.' <span class="GramE">" (</span>Record
on Appeal, pp. 360-363)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The payment to the petitioner made by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span>
was not disputed in the appellate court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering this admitted payment, the only issue that cropped up was
the effect of payment made by the <span class="SpellE">reinsurers</span> to the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the petitioner's
argument that the respondents had no interest in the reinsurance contract as
this is strictly between the petitioner as insured and the reinsuring company
pursuant to Section 91 (should be Section 98) of the Insurance Code has no
basis.</p>

<blockquote>"In general a <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span>, on payment
of a loss acquires the same rights by subrogation as are acquired in similar

</span>This Petition presents these fundamental questions which we believe were
resolved erroneously by the Court of Appeals ('CA')." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">These questions are premised on the petitioner's theory that as a

reimburse certain amounts given by the respondents to the petitioner as their
contributions to the intended corporation, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"However, defendant Lim should be held liable to pay his
co-defendants' cross-claims in the total amount of P184<span class="GramE">,878.74</span>

representing the latter's participation in the ownership of the subject
airplanes and spare parts (Exhibit 58).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, the cross-party plaintiffs incurred additional expenses,
hence, the total sum of P184<span class="GramE">,878.74</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We first state the principles.</p>

<blockquote>"While it has been held that as between themselves the rights
of the stockholders in a defectively incorporated association should be
governed by the supposed charter and the laws of the state relating thereto and
not by the rules governing partners (Cannon v. Brush Electric Co., 54 A. 121,
96 Md. 446, 94 Am. S.R. 584), it is ordinarily held that persons who attempt,
but fail, to form a corporation and who carry on business under the corporate
name occupy the position of partners inter se (Lynch v. Perryman, 119 P. 229,
29 <span class="SpellE">Okl</span>. <span class="GramE">615, <span class="SpellE">Ann.Cas</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">1913A 1065).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, where persons associate themselves together under articles to
purchase property to carry on a business, and their organization is so
defective as to come short of creating a corporation within the statute, they
become in legal effect partners inter se, and their rights as members of the
company to the property acquired by the company will be recognized (Smith v. <span class="SpellE">Schoodoc</span> Pond Packing Co., 84 A. 268, 109 Me. 555; Whipple
v. Parker, 29 Mich. 369).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, where
certain persons associated themselves as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a
</span>corporation for the development of land for irrigation purposes, and
each conveyed land to the corporation, and two of them contracted to pay a
third the difference in the proportionate value of the land conveyed by him,
and no stock was ever issued in the corporation, it was treated as a trustee
for the associates in an action between them for an accounting, and its capital
stock was treated as partnership assets, sold, and the proceeds distributed
among them in proportion to the value of the property contributed by each (<span class="SpellE">Shorb</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Beaudry</span>, 56 Cal.
446).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>However,</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u>
