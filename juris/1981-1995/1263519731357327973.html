<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (pp. 10-11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed separate motions for reconsideration which,
however, were denied. Hence, the present petitions alleging that respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> committed reversible errors in convicting
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Peñaverde</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermita</span>
of the crimes charged and presenting for resolution the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not serious doubts exist as to the
probability of the commission of the offenses imputed to herein petitioners.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there is conspiracy between
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaverde</span>
and his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Melecio</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Hermita</span>
to commit the offenses.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first issue, petitioners contend that <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Peñaverde</span>, as <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of <span class="SpellE">Manapao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Minalabac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, is not an accountable officer; that the BIDA funds in
the amount of P5,000.00 to which <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Manapao</span> is entitled was not entrusted to his custody but to
the custody and control of Provincial Development Officer Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Badiola</span>, who issued the checks for the purchase of
construction materials and for the cost of labor; and that since <span class="SpellE">Badiola</span> is the accountable officer and not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Peñaverde</span>, he (<span class="SpellE">Penaverde</span>) cannot
therefore be guilty of the crime of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of
public funds. Further, they argue that assuming, without admitting, that there
was <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds, the taking of the
amount from the P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in three (3) different
occasions constitutes one (1) crime only.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment to instant petitions the Solicitor General admits
that petitioners may not be convicted of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
because they were not accountable officers. Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Badiola</span>,
the Provincial Development Officer, admitted that he has been the <span class="GramE">accountable</span> officer for the BIDA funds.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do I understand Mr. <span class="SpellE">Badiola</span>
that you were the one who issued these Exhibits A and A-1, these checks?</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You were the one who issued these checks
because you were the one in charge of disbursing this amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> BIDA funds in your capacity as Provincial
Development Officer?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And you are the accountable officer
insofar as that fund is concerned?</blockquote>

 14, 1981</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">However, the Solicitor General alleged
that in Criminal Cases Nos. 2136 and 2138 petitioners conspired to induce <span class="SpellE">Rito</span> Sultan, the owner of the <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>
Hardware which was granted the award for materials, to part with the remaining
balance of P4<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, in the amount of P300.00 and
P1,897.00, on two (2) different occasions on the pretext that the said amount
was for the repair of the school. After receiving the balance, they misappropriated
it. Thus, they were properly charged in two separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Malversation</span> of Public Funds, although they were
only guilty of <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>, a lesser offense (<span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 13 SCRA 366).</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in Criminal Case No. 2137, petitioners conspired to induce
Municipal Development Officer <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Olaño</span> to give them a check for P500.00, the amount
allegedly awarded for labor, by misrepresenting through a picture that the
footpath project was already completed. They eventually <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
the check and misappropriated it, for the third occasion, to the damage of the
government.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the allegation that there was error on the part
of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in concluding that
petitioners conspired in the commission of the offense, suffice it to say that
the basis of its finding was the credibility of witnesses. Pursuant to Section
7 of Presidential Decree No. 1606, in relation to Section 2, Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court, the findings of fact of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
are entitled to great respect and only questions of laws may be raised to the
Supreme Court. Besides, well settled is the rule that the findings of trial
court on credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed unless such findings
overlook certain facts of substance and value which, if considered, might
affect results of case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Cases Nos. 2136, 2137 and 2138, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find that the crimes committed by the herein petitioners are <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>, not <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> as
charged in the information.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the conviction of petitioners by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in Criminal Case No. 2135 is hereby AFFIRMED.
