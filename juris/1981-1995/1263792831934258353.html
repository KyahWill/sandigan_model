decision in CA-G.R. No. 00783 on the ground that the findings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the </span>respondent Court of Appeals are
based on misapprehension of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">facts </span>and
conflict with those <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the trial

<p class="BODY">Arturo Arbatin was the successful bidder in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sale </span>at public auction of junk <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>other unserviceable government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">property located </span>at the compound of

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On September 8, 1979, at
4:00 o'clock in the morning, on a Saturday and a non-working day, while the
private respondent was tying a cable to a pile of scrap iron to be loaded on a
truck inside the premises of the compound, and while the bucket of the
payloader driven by Ramon Buensalido was being raised, the bucket suddenly fell
and hit Adarle on the right back portion of his head just below the nape of his

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">While still in the

Arbatin, his employer; Buensalido, the </span><span class="GramE">payloader</span>
operator; Candelario Marcelino, the civil engineer; and petitioner, the Highway
District Engineer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">During the trial on the
merits, the petitioner put up the defense that he had no knowledge of or

when it happened, he was not present </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the government
compound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the fact that it

part of his evidence, the petitioner presented a memorandum directed to a
certain Mr. Orlando Panaguiton ordering the latter to take charge of the
district until his return (Exh. 1).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trial court found
that, with the exception of the petitioner, all of the defendants were present
at the Highway's compound when the accident occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it still adjudged the petitioner
liable for damages because the petitioner was supposed to know what his men do
with their government equipment within an area under his supervision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January

court rendered a decision finding all the defendants </span>liable for damages
under Articles 1172 and 2176 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the New
Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dispositive portion of
the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, <span class="GramE">this</span> court orders the
defendants to pay to plaintiff the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">amounts
stated in the complainant's </span>prayer as follows:</blockquote>

plaintiff the sum of P312.00 monthly from <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1979</st1:date> until his release from the hospital.</blockquote>

further hospitalization until the release of plaintiff from the hospital;</blockquote>

plaintiff the sum of at least P100,000.00 as actual and compensatory damages,
considering that plaintiff Eduardo Adarle is totally incapacitated for any
employment for life;</blockquote>

plaintiff the sum of P20,000.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as </span>moral

discretion of the Honorable Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay the
plaintiff the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as attorney's
fees." <span class="GramE">(pp. 129-130, Original Records).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner appealed
to the Intermediate Appellate Court which affirmed the decision of the trial
court and further ordered the defendants to pay P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
exemplary damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant Candelario
Marcelino was, however, absolved from liability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the appellate court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"That <span class="GramE">payloader</span> owned by the
Government, as found by the lower court, should not have been operated that <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="9">Saturday, September 8, 1979</st1:date>, a
Saturday, a non-working holiday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no official order from the proper authorities authorizing Arbatin and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plaintiff to work and Buensalido to operate
the <span class="GramE">payloader</span> on that day inside the Highway
compound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereabouts, we can logically
deduce that </span>Arbatin <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
plaintiff went to the compound to work with the previous knowledge and consent
of Highway District Engineer Jose E. Genson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">And allowed him, probably upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the request of Arbatin.</span></span></span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have noted that Genson testified that his
office does not authorize work on Saturdays.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Genson testified that he was in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
from September 9 and 10, 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accident
occurred on September 8, in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In his answer, Genson did not allege his presence in <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>
on September 9 and 10.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x x x.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We fully concur with the lower court's conclusions regarding
the physical presence of appellants inside the compound on that fateful day,
pursuant to a previous understanding with Arbatin for plaintiff to work on the
scrap iron and for Buensalido to operate the <span class="GramE">payloader</span>
inside the compound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arbatin and
plaintiff would not go to the compound on that Saturday, if there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was no previous understanding with Genson and
Buensalido.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The liability of Genson is based on fault, intentional and
voluntary or negligent (Elcano v. Hill, 77 SCRA 106; Jimena v. Lincallo, 63
O.G. 1115, 8 C. A.R. 2567).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He gave
permission to Arbatin, plaintiff and Buensalido to work on Saturday, a
non-working day, in contravention of his office' rules and regulations
outlawing work on Saturdays." (pp. 29-30, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this present petition,
the petitioner contends that the appellate court committed a palpable error
when it ruled that the petitioner was present when the accident happened and
that he had given permission to the other defendants to work on a Saturday, a
non-working day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner argues
that considering these were the facts relied upon by the said </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">holding that he was negligent and thus liable for damages, such a <span class="GramE">conclusion,</span> is without basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner further
contends that the appellate court erred in not holding that the suit against
the petitioner was, in effect, a suit <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">against
</span>the government and, therefore, should be dismissed under the principle
of non-suability of the state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As regards the
petitioner's second contention, we hold that the petitioner's identification as
the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Highway District Engineer in the complaint
filed by the private respondent did not result in the said complaint's becoming

Government".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the
accident in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">case </span>at bar

belongs to the Government, the work <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was

<blockquote>"The ISU liability thus arose from
tort and not from contract; and it is a well-entrenched rule in this
jurisdiction, embodied in Article 2180 of the Civil Code of the Philippines,
that the State <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is liable only for torts
caused by its special agents, specially commissioned to carry out the acts

liable therefor."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Therefore,
the defense of the petitioner that he cannot be made liable under the principle
of non-suability of the state cannot be sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the main contention of the petitioner that the
appellate court based its conclusions on an erroneous finding of fact, we agree
with him that the appellate court's finding that he was present within the
premises when the accident happened is not supported by evidence indisputably
showing that he was indeed there.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the evidence fails to establish petitioner Genson's
presence when the payloader's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bucket
fell on the head of Mr. Adarle, any </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">liability </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">on his part would be based only on his alleged failure to exercise
proper supervision over his subordinates (See Umali v. Bacani, 69 SCRA 263,
267-268).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the trial court, Mr. Genson authorized work on a
Saturday when no work was supposed to be done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It stated that the petitioner should know what his men do with their
government equipment and he should neither be lax nor lenient in his
supervision over them.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:41.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The petitioner contends that:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No evidence on record
exists that Genson gave authority to Adarle and Arbatin, either verbally or in
writing, to enter and work inside the Highways Compound on <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1979</st1:date>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

the cranes or payloaders have to be brought there.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There is likewise no

engineer's office was ever filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
more logical to presume that Buensalido, the operator of the <span class="GramE">payloader</span>,
was trying to earn a little money on the side from the junk buyer and that his

arrangement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the records <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>this case, we are not disposed to

office practice in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue
before us is subsidiary liability for tort committed by a government employee
who is moonlighting on a non-working day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, it is a well-settled principle of law that a
public official may be liable in his personal private capacity for whatever
damage he may have caused by his act done with malice and in bad faith,
(Mindanao realty Corp. v. Kintanar, 6 SCRA 814) or beyond the scope of his
authority or jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">the</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippine

therefore, is whether</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioner

<blockquote>"Petitioner contends that, contrary to the holding of the
respondent Court of Appeals, he was not sued in his personal capacity, but in
his official capacity. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Neither was
malice or bad faith alleged against him in the complaint, much less proven by
the evidence, as the respondent court made no such finding of malice or bad
faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Examining the allegations of the complaint and reviewing the
evidence it would indeed be correct to say that petitioner was sued in his
official capacity, and that the most that was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">imputed to him is act of culpable neglect, inefficiency and gross
indifference in the performance of his official duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily, this is not imputation of bad faith
or malice, and what is more was not convincingly proven."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the respondent court, "Genson and Buensalido
divested themselves of their public positions and privileges to accommodate an
acquaintance or probably for inordinate gain." <span class="GramE">(p. 31,
Rollo).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing from the records that Genson received
anything which could be called "inordinate gain".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that he permitted work on a
Saturday to accommodate an acquaintance but it is more plausible that he simply
wanted to clear his compound of junk and the best time for the winning bidder
to do it was on a non-working day.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, we see no malice, bad faith, or gross negligence on
the part of Genson to hold him liable for the acts of Buensalido and Arbatin.</p>
