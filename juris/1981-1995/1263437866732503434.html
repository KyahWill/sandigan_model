were filed with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 11, Davao City, on September
16, 1992, the trial court issued an Order suspending petitioner until the
termination of the case on the basis of Section 47, R.A. 6975, otherwise known
as Department of Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 47.  Preventive
Suspension Pending Criminal Case. - Upon the filing of a<i> </i>complaint or
information sufficient in form and substance against a member of the PNP for
grave felonies where the penalty imposed by law is six (6) years and one (1)
day or more, <u>the court shall immediately suspend the accused from office
until the case is terminated.</u>  Such
case shall be subject to continuous trial and shall be terminated within ninety
(90) days from arraignment of the accused.  (Underscoring ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On October 11, 1993, petitioner filed a motion to lift the order
for his suspension,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
relying on Section 42 of P.D. 807 of the Civil Service Decree, that his

respondent judge denied the motion pointing out that under Section 47 of R.A.
6975, the accused shall be suspended from office until his case is
terminated.  The motion for
reconsideration of the order of denial was, likewise, denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> to set aside the
orders of respondent Judge and to command him to lift petitioner's preventive
suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find the
petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the case of petitioner who is charged
with murder and attempted murder under the Revised Penal Code falls squarely
under Sec. 47 of RA 6975 which specifically applies to members of the PNP.  In dispute however, is whether the provision
limits the period of suspension to 90 days, considering that while the first
sentence of Sec. 47 provides that the accused who is charged with grave
felonies where the penalty imposed is six (6) years and one (1) day shall be
suspended from office "until the case is terminated", the second
sentence of the same section mandates that the case, which shall be subject to
continuous trial, shall be terminated within 90 days from the arraignment of
the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner posits that as a member of the Philippine National
Police, under Sec. 91 of RA 6975 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 91.  The Civil Service
Law and its implementing rules and regulations shall apply to all personnel of
the Department.,</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">he is covered by the Civil Service Law,
particularly  Sec. 42 of PD 807 of the
Civil Service Decree, which limits the maximum period of suspension to ninety
(90) days, thus:</p>

<blockquote>SEC.<span style=""> </span>42.  Lifting of Preventive Suspension <i>Pending
Administrative Investigation.- </i>When the administrative case against the
officer or employee under preventive suspension is not finally decided by the
disciplining authority within the period of ninety (90) days after the date of
suspension of the respondent who is not a presidential appointee, the
respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the service; <i>Provided, </i>That
when the delay in the disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence
or petition of the respondent, the period of delay shall not be counted in
computing the period of suspension herein provided.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He claims that an imposition of
preventive suspension of over 90 days is contrary to the Civil Service Law and
would be a violation of his constitutional right to equal protection of
laws.  He further asserts that the
requirements in Sec. 47 of R.A. 6975 that "the court shall immediately
suspend the accused from office until the case is terminated" and the
succeeding sentence, "Such case shall be subject to continuous trial and
shall be terminated within ninety (90) days from arraignment of the
accused" are both substantive and should be taken together to mean that if
the case is not terminated within 90 days, the period of preventive suspension
must be lifted because of the command that the trial must be terminated within
ninety (90) days from arraignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">First.  The language of
the first sentence of Sec. 47 of R.A. 6975 is clear, plain and free from
ambiguity.  It gives no other meaning
than that the suspension from office of the member of the PNP charged with
grave offense where the penalty is six years and one day or more shall last
until the termination of the case.  The
suspension cannot be lifted <u>before</u> the termination of the case.  The second sentence of the same Section
providing that the trial must be terminated within ninety (90) days from
arraignment does not qualify or limit the first sentence.  The two can stand independently of each
other.  The first refers to the period
of suspension.  The second deals with
the time frame within which the trial should be finished.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suppose the trial is not terminated within ninety days from
arraignment, should the suspension of accused be lifted?  The answer is certainly no.  While the law uses the mandatory word
"shall" before the phrase "be terminated within ninety (90)
days", there is nothing in R.A. 6975 that suggests that the preventive
suspension of the accused will be lifted if the trial is not terminated within
that period.  Nonetheless, the Judge who
fails to decide the case within the period without justifiable reason may be
subject to administrative sanctions and, in appropriate cases where the facts
so warrant, to criminal<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> or
civil liability.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
If the trial is unreasonably delayed without fault of the accused such that he
is deprived of his right to a speedy trial, he is not without a remedy.  He may ask for the dismissal of the
case.  Should the court refuse to
dismiss the case, the accused can compel its dismissal by <i><span style="">certiorari, </span></i>prohibition or <i>mandamus</i>,
or secure his liberty by <i><span style="">habeas
corpus.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Second.  Petitioner
misapplies Sec. 42 of PD 807.  A
meticulous reading of the section clearly shows that it refers to the lifting
of preventive suspension in pending administrative investigation, not in
criminal cases, as here.  What is more,
Section 42 expressly limits the period of preventive suspension to ninety (90)
days.  Sec. 91 of R.A. 6975 which states
that "The Civil Service Law and its implementing rules shall apply to all
personnel of the Department" simply means that the provisions of the Civil
Service Law and its implementing rules and regulations are applicable to
members of the Philippine National Police insofar as the provisions, rules and
regulations are not inconsistent with R.A. 6975.  Certainly, Section 42 of the Civil Service Decree which limits
the preventive suspension to ninety (90) days cannot apply to members of the
PNP because Sec. 47 of R.A. 6995 provides differently, that is, the suspension
where the penalty imposed by law exceeds six (6) years shall continue until the
case is terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third.  Petitioner's
reliance on <i><span style="">Layno and Deloso </span></i>is
misplaced.  These cases all stemmed from
charges in violation of R.A. 3019 (1060), otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act which, unlike R.A. 6975, is silent on the duration of the
preventive suspension.  Sec. 13 of R.A.
3019 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>Suspension and loss of benefits.- </i>Any public officer against
whom any criminal prosecution under a valid information under this Act or under
the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on bribery is pending in court, shall
be suspended from office.  Should he be
convicted by final judgment, he shall lose all retirement or gratuity benefits
under any law, but if he is acquitted, he shall be entitled to reinstatement
and to the salaries and benefits which he failed to receive during suspension,
unless in the meantime administrative proceedings have been filed against him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i>Layno</i>, the duly elected mayor of Lianga,
Surigao del Sur, was preventively suspended after an information was filed
against him for offenses under R.A. 3019 (1060), the Anti-Graft Corrupt
Practices Act.  He had been suspended
for four (4) months at the time he filed a motion to lift his preventive
suspension.  We held that his indefinite
preventive suspension violated the "equal protection clause" and
shortened his term of office.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>2.  Petitioner is a duly elected municipal mayor
of Lianga, Surigao del Sur.  His term of
office does not expire until 1986.  Were
it not for this information and the suspension decreed by the Sandiganbayan
according to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, he would have been all
this while in the full discharge of his functions as such municipal mayor.  He was elected precisely to do so.  As of October 26, 1983, he has been unable
to.  It is a basic assumption of the
electoral process implicit in the right of suffrage that the people are
entitled to the services of elective officials of their choice.  For misfeasance or malfeasance, any of them
could, of course, be proceeded against administratively or, as in this
instance, criminally.  In either case,
his culpability must be established.  Moreover, if there be a criminal action, he is entitled to the constitutional
presumption of innocence.  A preventive
suspension may be justified.  Its
continuance, however, for an unreasonable length of time raises a due process
question.  For even if thereafter he
were acquitted, in the meanwhile his right to hold office had been
nullified.  Clearly, there would be in
such a case an injustice suffered by him.  Nor is he the only victim.  There
is injustice inflicted likewise on the people of Lianga.  They were deprived of the services of the
man they had elected to serve as mayor.  In that sense, to paraphrase Justice Cardozo, the protracted continuance
of this preventive suspension had outrun the bounds of reason and resulted in
sheer oppression.  A denial of due
process is thus quite manifest.  It is
to avoid such an unconstitutional application that the order of suspension
should be lifted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Nor is it solely the denial of procedural
due process that is apparent.  There is
likewise an equal protection question.  If the case against petitioner Layno were administrative in character
the Local Government Code would be applicable.  It is therein clearly provided that while preventive suspension is
allowable for the causes therein enumerated, there is this emphatic limitation
on the duration thereof:  "In all
cases, preventive suspension shall not extend beyond sixty days after the start
of said suspension." It may be recalled that the principle against
indefinite suspension applies equally to national government officials.  So it was held in the leading case of Garcia
v. Hon. Executive Secretary.  According
to the opinion of Justice Barrera:  "To adopt the theory of respondents that an officer appointed by
the President, facing administrative charges, can be preventively suspended
indefinitely, would be to countenance a situation where the preventive
suspension can, in effect, be the penalty itself without a finding of guilt
after due hearing, contrary to the express mandate of the Constitution and the
Civil Service law." Further:  "In the guise of a preventive suspension, his term of office could
be shortened and he could in effect, be removed without a finding of a cause
duly established after due hearing, in violation of the Constitution.  Clearly then, the policy of the law mandated
by the Constitution frowns at a suspension of indefinite duration.  In this particular case, the mere fact that
petitioner is facing a charge under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act
does not justify a different rule of law.  To do so would be to negate the safeguard of the equal protection
guarantee.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case of <i><span style="">Deloso, </span></i>likewise,
involved another elective official who was preventively suspended as provincial
governor, also under RA 3019 the Anti-Graft Law.  This Court, faced with similar factual circumstances as in <i><span style="">Layno</span></i><span style="">, </span>applied the ruling in the latter case "in relation to the
principles of due process and equal protection."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is readily apparent that Section 13 of R.A. 3019 upon which
the preventive suspension of the accused in <i><span style="">Layno </span></i>and <i><span style="">Deloso </span></i>was
based is silent with respect to the duration of the preventive suspension, such
that the suspension of the accused therein for a prolonged and unreasonable
length of time raised a due process question.  Not so in the instant case.  Petitioner is charged with murder under the Revised Penal Code and it is
undisputed that he falls squarely under Sec. 47 of R. A. 6995 which
categorically states that his <u><span style="">suspension
shall last until the case is terminated</span></u><span style="">.  </span>The succeeding
sentence of the same section requires the case to be subjected to continuous
trial which shall be terminated within ninety (90) days from arraignment of the
accused.  As previously emphasized,
nowhere in the law does it say that after the lapse of the 90-day period for
trial, the preventive suspension should be lifted.  The law is clear, the ninety (90) days duration applies to the
trial of the case not to the suspension.  Nothing else should be read into the law.  When the words and phrases of the statute are clear and
unequivocal, their meaning determined from the language employed and the
statute must be taken to mean exactly what it says.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourth.  From the
deliberations of the Bicameral Conference Committee on National Defense
relative to the bill that became R.A. 6975, the meaning of Section 47 of R.A.
6975 insofar as the period of suspension is concerned becomes all the more
clear.  We quote:</p>

a criminal case but here we are talking, let's say, of murder, rape, treason,

context that <u>there is a difference between a purely anti-graft case  and a criminal  case which could be a serious  case</u> since it is six years and one day or more, so it must be

<p class="BODY">The foregoing discussions reveal the legislative intent to place
on preventive suspension a member of the PNP charged with grave felonies where
the penalty imposed by law exceeds six years of imprisonment and which
suspension continues until the case against him is terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason why members of the <span style="">PNP </span>are treated differently from the other classes of persons
charged criminally or administratively insofar as the application of the rule
on preventive suspension is concerned is that policemen carry weapons and the
badge of the law which can be used to harass or intimidate witnesses against
them, as succinctly brought out in the legislative discussions.</p>

<p class="BODY">If a suspended policeman criminally charged with a serious
offense is reinstated to his post while his case is pending, his victim and the
witnesses against him are obviously exposed to constant threat and thus easily
cowed to silence by the mere fact that the accused is in uniform and
armed.  The imposition of preventive
suspension for over 90 days under Section 47 of R.A. 6975 does not violate the
suspended policeman's constitutional right to equal protection of the laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">The equal protection clause exists to prevent undue favor or
privilege.  It is intended to eliminate
discrimination and oppression based on inequality.  Recognizing the existence of real differences among men, the
equal protection clause does not demand absolute equality.  It merely requires that all persons shall be
treated alike, under like circumstances and conditions both as to the
privileges conferred and liabilities enforced.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the equal protection clause does not absolutely forbid classifications,
