appellant pleaded not guilty.  After
joint trial of the aforesaid <span style="">cases, </span>the
court below rendered judgment on October 15, 1991, with the following
dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 735 for killing Elino Apolinario,
the Court finds and declares the accused, Salvador Caras @ "Badong,"
GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT of the crime of murder, defined and penalized by
Art. 248 of our Revised Penal Code with reclusion temporal in its maximum

him an Indeterminate Penalty of imprisonment ranging from ten (10) years and
one (1) day of prision mayor, as minimum, to eighteen (18) years, eight (8)
months and one (1) day of reclusion temporal, as maximum, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

defined and penalized by Art. 248 of our Revised Penal Code with reclusion
temporal in its maximum period to death.  Due to the abolition of capital punishment in our 1987 Constitution, the

<p class="BODY">From that judgment, appellant sought relief from the Court of
Appeals which, as stated at the outset, rendered its confirmatory but modified
judgment.  For purposes thereof, the
antecedent facts capsulized by the trial court were adopted by the Court of
Appeals and, finding the same to be evidentiarily sound, we reproduce at length
those factual foundations of this case:</p>

<blockquote>x x x At around seven o'clock in the evening of 28 August 1984, in
Sto. Niño, Western Samar, a member of the Integrated National Police, Pfc. Elino
Apolinario and a civilian named Guillermo Carcellar were shot dead allegedly by
the appellant.  Two separate
informations for murder were filed (Records of Criminal Case No. 736, p.
1).  Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded
not guilty (Records of Criminal Case No. 736, p. 28).  The two cases were tried jointly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the trial, the prosecution presented Evelyn Santos, Francisco
Apolinario (brother of victim Elino), Mario Casio, and Dolores Ramirez as
witnesses.  Their version of the
incident is as follows:  On the night in
question, Francisco Apolinario was invited by Sgt. Antonio Cabasares (then the
Station Commander of the INP station at Sto. Niño, Samar), the superior of
victim Elino, for a few drinks at the house of Troadio Ramirez.  Ramirez also operated a store at his
residence.  The drinking spree inside
the residence was attended by said Cabasares, Francisco, appellant, a certain
Nicart, and the owner of the house, Ramirez.  Cabasares sent appellant and Nicart on an errand to buy some "<i>pulutan.</i>"<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While the drinking session was going on inside the house,
Francisco, Elino and Guillermo Carcellar arrived, intending to purchase half a
case of beer from the store.  When
Cabasares saw Elino, he beckoned him to go inside the house.  Elino entered the house and Cabasares
offered him a shot of whisky.  Elino
drank it and then asked for leave to go home claiming that he had visitors
waiting for him.  Cabasares would not
let him and instead, he gave Elino another shot of whisky.  Elino drank the liquor after which he begged
to be excused.  He managed to go out of
the house.  However, Cabasares followed
him.  When Cabasares caught up with
Elino, he (Cabasares) hit Elino on the head.  Elino asked his superior why he was hit and then knelt before him
(Cabasares).  Cabasares grabbed the
kneeling Elino and pulled him away about 45 to 50 meters across the street
where it was dark (as it could not be reached by the illumination from the
petromax lamps which lit the inside of the Ramirez residence).  Elino clung to the leg of Cabasares as the
latter (Cabasares) dragged him causing Cabasares to fall.  When both were on the ground, they rolled
about (<i>"paligod-­ligod", </i><i><span style="">TSN, 06 </span>September 1989,</i> p. 14).  In the struggle that ensued, Elino was able to maneuver himself
on the top of Cabasares, pinning down the enemy's arms to the ground.  Cabasares then shouted to appellant who had
by then arrived from an errand:  <i>"Badong,
tabang!" </i>(<i>"Badong, help!", TSN, 11 October 1990,</i> <span style="">p. 11).  Elino told Cabasares he was not going to fight him </span>(Cabasares).  With that statement, he released Cabasares
and fled towards his house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, Elino's brother Francisco helped Cabasares up on his
feet.  Responding to Cabasares' call for
help, appellant together with Sgt. Cesar Ilaw, Militar Nicart, Pat. Javate, a
certain Boy, and one Monsanto arrived at the scene.  Appellant was toting an armalite rifle.  When Cabasares was up, he ordered Francisco at gunpoint to lead
them to Elino's house.  Francisco begged
for his brother's safety and asked Cabasares to let the incident pass.  But, Cabasares was unmoved.  Francisco accompanied the group including
appellant to his brother's house.  When
they reached Elino's residence, its entrance was closed.  Cabasares instructed Francisco to<span style=""> </span>knock at the door and call on to (sic)
his brother.  Elino opened the door and
Cabasares pushed Francisco inside the house.  He then dragged Elino towards the outside.  As they reached the bamboo fence of the residence, Elino held on
to one of its posts.  At that point
Francisco embraced his brother.  Seeing
appellant aiming an armalite rifle at Elino from his arms, Francisco pleaded
with him not to shoot his brother, and even gestured with an open palm
motioning appellant to stop.  When
Francisco released Elino from his arms, Cabasares uttered the order to
kill.  A volley of bullets emanated from
the appellant's armalite riddling Elino's body.  Elino, however, managed to stagger inside his house.  Cabasares and appellant followed him.  Using the armalite he had grabbed from
appellant, Cabasares pumped some more bullets into Elino's body after which the
body was dragged outside the house.  Then Cabasares went back inside the house.  Seeing Guillermo hiding in a corner, Cabasares shot Carcellar
with one bullet in the head using the same weapon he had shot Elino with.  As this was going on, appellant had gone to
Elino's bedroom and found the service armalite issued to Elino.  Using this armalite, appellant strafed the
inside of Elino's house with bullets.  Then, the attackers left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Medico-Legal Necropsy Report dated 12 September 1984, issued by
the Calbayog City General Hospital (Annex "D", Records of Criminal
Case No. 735, p. 8) determined the cause of death of victim Elino as
"cardio pulmonary failure due to hemopneumothorax, massive hemorrhage,
multiple punctured wound (gunshot), neurogenic shock." In a similar
report, the cause of death of victim Carcellar was declared to be
"crushing injury head to gunshot." (Annex "A", Records of
Criminal Case No. 736, pp. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant admitted having killed the two victims, but invoked the
justifying circumstance of defense of stranger provided in Article 11,
paragraph 3 of the Revised Penal Code.  Defense witnesses Sgt. Antonio Cabasares, Sgt. Pablo Enguerra, Sgt. Ray
Basas, Sgt. Cesar Ilaw, and appellant testified to this effect:  Appellant was a provincial guard at
Catarman, Samar.  He was sent to Sto.
Niño on a mission to re-arrest an escapee-prisoner.  He stayed there for a few days lodging in the house of one Saling
Hechanova.  Several other men were
boarders in the same house, namely:  Sgt. Ilaw, Sgt. Javati and Pali Javati who were soldiers assigned at
Catbalogan, Samar.  On the date and time
in question, when they were about to take supper in the second floor of the
Hechanova house, a voice which the other soldiers recognized as that of Sgt.
Cabasares’ called out for help.  Two
soldiers CIC Javati and Ilaw immediately rushed downstairs and outdoors with
their armalites, leaving behind appellant.  The latter found an armalite inside one of the rooms in the house,
picked up the weapon and then went out of the house.  As he stepped out of the Hechanova residence, he heard the
screaming voice of a woman coming from a house (which later turned out to be
the house of victim Elino) about a hundred meters away.  He walked towards the house and peeped
through its window.  From where he
stood, he saw a man (later identified as the victim Elino) trying to seize a
pistol from a second man (later identified as Cabasares).  Then he saw a third man (later identified as
victim Carcellar) with an armalite.  Appellant witnessed Carcellar cocked (sic) the armalite.  Perceiving Carcellar to be on the verge of
killing Cabasares, appellant shot Carcellar.  Appellant claimed to have heard only two shots from the rifle he
fired.  Then, appellant went inside the
house and picked up the armalite rifle of Carcellar.  Elino (the one who was trying to seize the pistol from Cabasares)
was, in the meantime, able to wrestle the gun from Cabasares.  Elino was about to shoot Cabasares.  Sensing the urgency of the situation,
appellant fired the armalite which was then set to "fully-automatic"
towards the would-be assailant.  These
two killings had a short interval of five seconds in between.  Cabasares (whose life appellant appears to
have saved) could not see appellant as the latter fired from the outside of the
house through the window, as it was very dark outdoors.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As the gun battle was going on, soldier Ilaw ducked on the ground
for safety.  He <span style="">could </span>not see anything as it was very dark.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the shooting incident, appellant entered the house where he
had shot two persons, and took the armalite of Carcellar as well as the pistol
of Cabasares.  The latter and appellant
then went out of the house.  Cabasares
informed appellant of the names of the two people he had shot after appellant
had told him that he did so to defend his (Cabasares’) life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, Cabasares put appellant under arrest.  Cabasares, together with appellant, left
Sto. Niño at 4:00 a.m. the next day.  Appellant was brought to Camp Lucban in Catbalogan.  There he surrendered to a certain Col.
Almaden.  Two <span style="">M16 </span>Armalite rifles <span style="">with </span>Serial
Nos. 067625 and 9007111 were also turned over to the aforementioned military
officer.  It appears that the M16
Armalite Rifle Serial No. 9007111 was issued to Cabasares <span style="">(<i>TSN, 04 July 1990,</i> </span>pp. 7-8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witness Cabasares' testimony echoed the version of the
prosecution.  It varied however with
respect to the events that transpired after Cabasares and Elino grappled.  Cabasares claimed that after Elino released
him, the latter left for his (Elino's) house.  As soon as he (Cabasares) stood up, he went to Elino's house accompanied
by Francisco.  The latter knocked on the
door of the house, and Elino opened the door.  Elino held an armalite rifle on his right hand with his finger on the
trigger.  Thinking that Elino was angry
at him, Cabasares immediately grabbed the barrel of the weapon with his left
hand, as he held his .38 caliber pistol in his right hand, his finger also on
its trigger.   Seeing this, Francisco
shouted "Don't do that." (<i>TSN, 24 January 1990,</i> p. 23), and
ran inside the house.  Using his left
hand, Elino grabbed Cabasares' right hand (which held the handgun).  As the two of them grappled with each
other's weapon, a gunshot was heard from behind Cabasares.  Cabasares felt something hit him on the
head, and he fell to the ground.  He
lost his grip on his gun and Elino took it.  At that point, Cabasares heard a volley of gunfire coming from behind
him, and Elino fell on top of Cabasares.  At the time the shooting occurred, Cabasares did not know who the
triggerman was.  However, when he turned
around in the direction where the shots had come after the actual firing, he
saw appellant who was outside Elino's house.  He (Cabasares) asked appellant why he shot Elino, and the latter replied
that it was because Elino was about to shoot him (Cabasares).</blockquote>

<blockquote>An Examination of the 10 empty cartridge cases (marked
"JNA-1" to "JNA-10" submitted to the PC/INP Crime
Laboratory in connection with the killing of the two victims was made by
comparing said cartridge cases with those fired from the M16 Rifle with Serial
No. 9007111 and those fired from the M16 Rifle with Serial No. 067626
(sic).  Ballistics Report No. B-326-84 (<i>Records
of Criminal Case No. 735,</i> p. 167) made the following conclusion:  “The specimens marked "JNA-1" - to
"JNA-10" were fired from the caliber 5.56 mm. rifle with Serial No.
9007111.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

intention not to file an additional appellant's brief." In view thereof, any
mention or citation herein of the briefs of the parties refer to those filed by
them in the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his recourse to said appellate court, appellant Caras would
want it, and now this Court, to believe, first, in his version of the incident;
second, that the testimony of the eyewitness of the prosecution was biased and
inconsistent; and, lastly, that he acted in defense of a stranger.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first and second assigned errors raise the question of
credibility of witness Francisco Apolinario.  Appellant contends that Apolinario's narration, on which the judgment of
conviction was predicated, "reveals the witness' penchant (for) telling
(an) incredible story borne (sic) out probably by his bias, exaggeration or
special interest <span style="">in </span>the outcome
of this case, he being the brother of the deceased Elino Apolinario."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
We have conscientiously reviewed and assayed the evidence, and we are
sufficiently persuaded to reject appellant's propositions.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the trial court even enumerated details which reveal that
"the evidence adduced by the accused show the same to be tainted with
irreconcilable inconsistencies with other facts established on record, while
the testimonies of the accused himself and Antonio Cabasares and Cesar Ilaw are
at loggerheads with each other, rendering the defense of stranger unreliable,
unconvincing and untenable."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The
efforts exerted by the lower court to clearly point out the evidence upon which
the verdict was based indubitably show that its presiding judge made an
exhaustive review of the transcripts of the stenographic notes.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has time and again reiterated the doctrinal rule that
it will not interfere with the findings of the trial court on the issue of
credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, unless said court had plainly
overlooked undisputed facts of substance and value which would have altered the
result of the case.  The findings of the
trial court are accorded great respect by an appellate tribunal for the latter
can only read in cold print the testimonies of the witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
If we appear doctrinaire by now repeating this precept, it is because of its
unquestionable applicability to the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the prosecution witnesses are relatives of the
victim does not necessarily indicate bias as would impair their
trustworthiness.  In the absence of
proof of ill motive on the part of witnesses, relationship between them and the
victim does not undermine their credibility.  On the contrary, it would be unnatural for persons such as the relatives
of the victim who themselves seek justice to commit injustice by imputing the
crime to persons other than those who are actually responsible therefor.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court gave weight and credence to the testimony of
Francisco Apolinario and we do not feel that <span style="">we </span>should disturb its appraisal thereof, unless some facts or
circumstances might have been overlooked and which may affect the adjudication
of the case.  Appellant, however, has
not submitted or demonstrated any compelling reason for us to depart from this
rule.  No evidence was presented by the
defense to show that prosecution witness Apolinario harbored any vindictive
feeling against appellant, or any circumstance as would affect the weight of
his testimony, except the inconsequential fact that Francisco was the brother
of the victim Elino.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not appellant acted in self-defense is
essentially a question of fact.  Again,
in the absence of any showing that the court <i>a </i><i><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>failed to appreciate facts and circumstances of weight and
substance that would have altered its conclusion, and it having observed the
demeanor of and heard the witnesses as they testified, said court was decidedly
in a better position to evaluate their testimonies.  No compelling reason, therefore, exists for this Court to impinge
upon matters more appropriately within the province of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, where an accused has admitted that he is the author
of the death of the victim and his defense is anchored on self-defense, it is
incumbent upon him to prove this justifying circumstance to the satisfaction of
the court.  To do so, he must rely on
the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the prosecution,
especially so since he himself has admitted the killing.  The burden is upon the accused to prove clearly
and sufficiently the elements of self-defense which is an affirmative
allegation, otherwise his conviction is inescapable.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a judicious review of the case, the Court of Appeals
categorically held that there was no unlawful aggression on the part of the
victim.  It buttressed its conclusion
with this telling observation:  "The situation posed no actual, imminent and real danger to a
stranger's life.  Cabasares' testimony
that he had grappled with Elino in the latter's house and, in the process, something
hit him on his head and injured him making him lose his grip on his handgun and
thereby putting him in danger of being shot by Elino, is totally
fabricated.  The Physical Injuries
Report issued by the Calbayog City General Hospital submitted by the defense as
Exhibit 2 to show that Cabasares sustained injuries from the grappling and to
prove unlawful aggression on the part of Elino indicates that the contusions
complained of by Cabasares were committed on 08 August 1985, as found in the
examination conducted on 29 August 1985.  Clearly the aforesaid report does not cover any injuries supposedly
sustained on 28 August 1984, the date in question.  x x x The absence of unlawful aggression negates the
applicability of the justifying circumstance of defense of stranger.  x x x."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals likewise concurred in the findings of the
trial court that the victims were unarmed.  This Court cannot likewise believe the allegation of the defense that
Elino was armed with an armalite.  As
readily perceived by said appellate court, if Elino was indeed so armed, he
would have been able to protect himself from the aggressors who had come for
him in his house.  On the contrary,
Elino was helplessly dragged out of his house, without any resistance from
him.  Carcellar, too, who had been
hiding in a corner was unquestionably unarmed.  Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals thus correctly held
appellant guilty of murder as the killing was attended by the qualifying
circumstance of abuse of superior strength when the unarmed victims were
mercilessly sprayed by him and Cabasares with bullets from high-powered
firearms.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as pointed out by the trial court and the Solicitor
General, appellant took flight after the filing of these criminal cases against
him, which fact, by jurisprudential fiat, is a clear indication of appellant's
guilt.  The trial court noted that the
accused fled, for which reason the cases were ordered archived for a time, and
emphasized that his flight was not only an indication of guilt but also
revealed appellant's awareness that his defense is untenable.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This adheres to our reiterative holding that if the accused honestly believed
that their acts constituted self-defense against the unlawful aggression of the
victim, they should have reported the incident to the police, instead of
escaping and avoiding the authorities until they were arrested or prevailed
upon to surrender.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In light of applicable law and jurisprudence, the evidence was
clearly sufficient to sustain the verdict holding appellant guilty of the crime
of murder as charged and proved.  Consequently, the Court of Appeals properly increased the imposable
penalty for the crimes as explained in the decretal portion of its judgment, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>"We note, however, that the penalty imposed by the court <i>a</i>
<i>quo</i> is erroneous.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of
murder is punishable by <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to
death.  Appellant admitted killing the
two victims herein.  The killings of the
two persons were attended with the qualifying aggravating circumstance of abuse
of superior strength.  Hence, the
killings reached the level of murder.  Dwelling is considered as a generic aggravating circumstance.  Appellant herein is entitled to the mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering that the generic aggravating circumstance of dwelling
is offset by the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender, the penalty
that should be imposed on the appellant is the medium period of the penalty
provided for under Article 248, which is <i>reclusion perpetua.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is affirmed with the modification
that accused-appellant in Criminal Cases Nos. 735 and 736 is hereby sentenced
to suffer two penalties of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to pay the heirs of
the victims in each case (a) civil indemnity in the sum of P50,000.00 consonant
with the ruling in the case of People vs. Lacao (201 SCRA 317 [1991]); (b) the
amount of P20,000.00 to the heirs of each of the  victims by way of moral damages <i>(People vs. Quilaton,</i> 205
SCRA 279 [1992]); and (c) P10,000.00 to the heirs of each of the victims as
exemplary damages, pursuant to Article 2230 of the <span style="">New </span>Civil Code by reason of the presence of two aggravating
circumstance which attended the commission of the crimes.
