October 12, 1979, in CA-G.R. No. 08609-SP, which set aside the decision of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dated September 22,
1978, in Civil Case No. 28389, which had affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
the judgment on the pleadings rendered by the Municipal Court of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, dated December 19, 1976, in Civil Case No. 3773.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1974, <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> and Company,
Limited Partnership, hereinafter referred to as Ortigas, filed with the
Municipal Court of San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, a complaint for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> against <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>, praying that after hearing, judgment be
rendered â€“ (1) ordering the defendant, his heirs, assigns or
successors-in-interests to vacate the subject lot and surrender full control
thereof to the plaintiff; (2) declaring the residential building constructed on
the lot by the defendant as forfeited in plaintiff's favor; and (3) condemning
the defendant to pay a monthly rent of P5,000.00 from July 18, 1971, up to the
time he vacates the premises; attorney's fees in the amount of P7,000.00;
exemplary damages in such amount as the court may fix; and the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No.
3773.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the defendant had
filed his answer, the Municipal Court of San Juan, upon motion of the
plaintiff, rendered a judgment on the <span class="GramE">pleadings</span> dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="12"><span style="">December
 19, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED.''</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a motion for reconsideration was denied, <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> appealed to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> which docketed the same as Civil Case No. 28389.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing a memorandum in support of
his appeal, <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1978</st1:date>, a motion to dismiss under Sec.
11, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

case on the merits if the parties therein file their pleadings and go to the
trial without any objection to such jurisdiction."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Alleging lack of jurisdiction of the
Municipal Court of San Juan and manifesting his objection to the exercise by
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> of its original
jurisdiction, <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> sought the dismissal of Civil
Case No. 3773.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, however, denied the motion to
dismiss and subsequently rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1978</st1:date>, affirming <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the judgment of the Municipal Court of San
Juan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> likewise issued a writ of execution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1978</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> simultaneously filed with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a notice of appeal and with the
Court <span style="">of Appeals a motion to extend
time to file petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a
resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="12"><span style="">December 7, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Court of Appeals granted <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> an extension of twenty (20) days from </span><st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="12"><span style="">December
 4, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, within
which to file a petition for review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
December 20, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> filed with the Court of
Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition, with preliminary
injunction, assailing:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the
jurisdiction of the Municipal Court of San Juan and the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; (b) the propriety or validity of the
judgment on the pleadings rendered by the Municipal Court of San Juan; and (c)
the propriety or validity of the Writ of Execution issued by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Docketed as CA-G.R. No.
08609-SP, the petition was given due course by the Court of Appeals which
subsequently rendered a decision dated </span><st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="10"><span style="">October 12, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision of the municipal court of
San Juan, Metro-Manila, as well as the decision of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> aforesaid, are hereby SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court of Appeals held that the
Municipal Court of San Juan had no jurisdiction over the case <span class="GramE">nor</span> the power to resolve <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
issues on the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>
but the same was denied by the Court of Appeals in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>
filed with this Court the present petition for <span style="">review of the decision of the Court of Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After analyzing the issues raised by <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>
before the Court of Appeals and resolved by said court in the decision under
review, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the jurisdiction of
the Municipal Court of San Juan and of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>; (b) the propriety or validity of the judgment on the
pleadings rendered by the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;
and (c) the propriety or validity of the Writ of Execution issued by the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, We find that the same are
purely legal in nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since appellate
jurisdiction over cases involving purely legal questions is exclusively vested
in this Court by Sec. 17 of the Judiciary Act (R. A. No. 296), it is readily
apparent that the decision under review was rendered by the Court of Appeals
without jurisdiction and should, therefore, be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that <span class="GramE">We</span>
resolved on <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1981</st1:date>, to
give due course to the petition for review and to consider the same as
submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">But as We set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals dated
October 12, 1979, for having been rendered without jurisdiction, We proceed
with the review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> dated September 22, 1978, and the judgment of the
Municipal Court of San Juan dated December 19, 1976, which said decision
affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, considering that the
appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was perfected on time, albeit
erroneously brought to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is in consonance with the spirit of Sec. 31 of the Judiciary Act
(R. A. No. 296, as amended) which provides that "(a<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ll</span></span> cases which may be erroneously brought to the
Supreme Court or to the Court of Appeals shall be sent to the proper court
which shall hear the same as if it has originally been brought before it."</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his contention that the Municipal Court of San
Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, did not have jurisdiction over the case
filed by <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> F.
<span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> cited in his comment to <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span>'
petition for review (which We considered as his answer to the petition) the
case of FUENTES AND GO TEK vs. HON. MUÃ‘OZ-PALMA, ETC., AND AYALA SECURITIES,
INC. (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-15074, </span><st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 31, 1960</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
108 Phil. 640).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have reviewed
Our decision in said case and We find the material facts thereof to be almost
identical to those of the case at bar, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) both cases involved complaints for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
filed against defendants who acquired possession of the subject lots by virtue
of agreements whereby the plaintiffs had contracted to sell the subject lots
and the defendants had in turn bound themselves to pay the <span class="SpellE">downpayments</span>
and the subsequent monthly installments on the purchase prices of said lots;
(2) the agreements in both cases allowed the purchasers to take possession of
the subject lots and to construct thereon buildings and/or other permanent improvements
but specified that before full payment of the purchase prices, the purchasers
would be considered as mere tenants or lessees of the subject lots; (3) the
agreements in both cases further provided that should the purchasers fail to
pay any of the monthly installments within ninety (90) days from its due date,
the contracts shall automatically be cancelled and all sums of money paid under
the same shall be considered as rentals on the property and the purchasers may
be ejected <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by the means provided for by law
for trespassers or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainers</span>; (4) in both
cases, the purchasers took possession of the subject lots after having made the
<span class="SpellE">downpayment</span> and constructed thereon buildings and/or
other permanent improvements; (5) in both cases, the purchasers failed to pay
the monthly installments which became due, prompting the plaintiffs to file the
complaints for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> which sought to
eject the purchasers-defendants from the subject lots; and (6) the complaints
for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> in both cases contained prayers
affecting the property rights of the parties in the permanent improveÂ­ments
constructed on the subject lots â€“ in the cited case, Ayala Securities, Inc.
prayed for the removal of the warehouses, garages and other permanent
improvements constructed by defendant Fuentes on the subject lots while in the
case at bar, <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> prayed that the residential
building constructed by defendant <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> on the
subject lot be declared forfeited in its favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">After noting that "(a)n action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>, which is a summary proceeding to wrest possession
from one who has no right thereto, is applicable only when the issue is that of
possession; but rights of property in the land created by the Agreements,
especially the relative rights and obligations of the parties to the
improvements are directly involved", this Court held in the cited case
that the Justice of the Peace Court (now Municipal Court) of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> did not have jurisdiction over the action filed by
Ayala Securities, Inc., as the same involved rights over real property, other
than mere right <span style="">of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court declared null and void the
proceedings in the court below and dismissed the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case filed by Ayala Securities, Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the above ruling applicable to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated, the complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
filed with the Municipal Court of San Juan sought not only the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the defendant from the subject lot, but
likewise prayed that the residential building constructed by him on the same
lot be declared forfeited in plaintiff's favor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, the issues raised before said inferior court did not only
involve possession of the lot but <span style="">also
the rights and obligations of the parties to the residential building which
under Art. 415 (1) of the Civil Code is considered real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff's prayer that said building be
declared forfeited in its favor directly puts in issue the ownership of said
real property.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the issues raised
by <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> before the Municipal Court of San Juan in
Civil Case No. 3773 exceeded the allowable scope of an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit which should be limited to the issue of
possession of real property, the case could not qualify as an exception to the
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance under Sec. 44(b) of the Judiciary
Act which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 44.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">ORIGINAL JURISDICTION.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Courts of First Instance shall have
original jurisdiction:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In all civil actions which involve the title
to or possession of real property, or any interest therein, or the legality of
any tax, impost or assessment, except actions of forci<span style="">ble entry into and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> on lands or
buildings, original jurisdiction of which is conferred by this Act upon city
and municipal courts;"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Consequently, the Municipal Court of San
Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, did not have jurisdiction over Civil
Case No. 3773.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its judgment dated <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1976</st1:date>, should therefore
be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since Civil Case No. 3773 was decided by the Municipal Court of
San Juan without jurisdiction over the subject matter thereof, said <span style="">case should have been dismissed by the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> when the same was brought
before it on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 11, Rule 40
of the Rules of Court, which <span class="GramE">We</span> have heretofore
quoted, provides for an instance when the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (to which original jurisdiction over the case filed
by <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> properly belonged) could have validly
assumed original jurisdiction over the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that provision is inapplicable to the case at bar since <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span> expressly objected to assumption of jurisdiction
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the decision of the Court of
First Instance dated </span><st1:date year="1978" day="22" month="9"><span style="">September 22, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, should likewise be set aside for lack of
jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, without prejudice to the right of <span class="SpellE">Ortigas</span> to file the proper action with the proper court,
the following are hereby set aside for lack of jurisdiction:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the decision of the Court of Appeals
