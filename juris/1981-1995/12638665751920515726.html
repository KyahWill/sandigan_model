				<H3>DIOSDADO DE VERA AND UNITED CMC TEXTILE WORKERS UNION, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION, CENTRAL TEXTILE MILLS, INC., AND/OR AGUSTIN CABATINGAN, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> de Vera was employed as a
mechanic in the weaving department of the Central Textile Mills, the herein
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He claims he
was active in union activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
course of his employment, he had been administered disciplinary sanctions for
various offenses, including not wearing the ID tag in the company premises,
leaving his workplace without permission, habitual tardiness, reporting for
work under the influence of liquor, and damaging property in the performance of
his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last two offenses were
each punished with 5 days suspension and the others with written or oral
warnings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioner had a row with Jesus <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, a fellow
worker, whom he hit in the head with a stick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The protagonists were soon pacified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> saw fit not to file any charge against
De Vera with the company or the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the private respondent, upon learning of the incident,
called for its investigation by a fact-finding committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was composed of a company representative
as chairman and two union representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the investigation, De Vera claimed he had on the date in
question asked <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> for payment of a P100.00 loan
he had extended him, but the latter resented the dunning and swore at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That provoked his attack on <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> himself never appeared before the
investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two months later, the
committee chairman, allegedly without notice to the two union members,
recommended De Vera's dismissal for violation of company rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting on this recommendation, the private
respondent dismissed the petitioner on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>,
the president of the CMC Textile Workers Union filed on its behalf and of the
petitioner a complaint for illegal dismissal against the Central Textile Mills,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After hearing, the complaint was
dismissed by Labor Arbiter Emerson C. <span class="SpellE">Tumanon</span> in a
decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1989</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On appeal, the decision was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
by the NLRC in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1990</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner then came to this Court alleging grave abuse of discretion on
the part of the public respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact of the NLRC are conclusive on this Court in
the absence of a showing that they were arrived at <span class="GramE">arbitrarily</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has failed to show such arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We therefore accept, on the basis of the
evidence of record, including the petitioner's own admission, that he had
indeed committed a violation of company rules by hitting <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
on the head.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming the provocation, we nevertheless agree that the attack
was not justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not correct to
say that the company was not itself prejudiced, for the peace in its premises
was disturbed and the discipline of the personnel affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent could not close its
eyes to the incident at the risk of further disregard of its rules, which it
had a right to enforce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> chose not to prefer charges did not prevent the
company from acting <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
to investigate the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also sustain the finding that the private respondent was not
guilty of any unfair labor practice, no evidence having been submitted to
support the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going deeper into the record, however, we find that the penalty
of dismissal was not commensurate with the offense, considering the other circumstances
of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We note, first of all,
that the petitioner had been working with the respondent company for fourteen
years and was apparently doing well except for the earlier-mentioned offenses
that had already been sufficiently punished.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The differences between De Vera and <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>
have long since been patched up and the two have decided to forget the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To all appearances, the
discipline of the company has not deteriorated as a result of the quarrel
between the two employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given all these facts, we feel that a lighter penalty than that
meted out to De Vera would have been more just, if not humane.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, since relations between the parties have already
been strained, we feel it is not practical anymore to reinstate the petitioner,
who is no longer welcome in the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We shall therefore sustain the penalty imposed, but with
modification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The modification is that
the petitioner shall be granted separation pay at the rate of one month salary
for every year of service, taking into account the nature and degree of the
offense he has committed, which is neither serious nor depraved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling is conformable to the case of
PLDT v. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>There should be no question that where it comes to such valid but
not iniquitous causes of failure to comply with work standards, the grant of
separation pay to the dismissed employee may be both just and compassionate,
particularly if he has worked for some time with the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, a subordinate who has irreconcilable
policy or personal differences with his employer may be validly dismissed for
demonstrated loss of confidence, which is an allowable ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A working mother who has also to take care of
her child may also be removed because of her poor attendance, this being
another authorized ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I<u>t is not
the employee's fault if he does not have the necessary aptitude for his work
but on the other hand the company cannot be required to maintain him just the
same at the expense of the efficiency of its operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He too may be validly replaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these and similar circumstances,
however, the award to the employee of separation pay would be sustainable under
the social justice policy even if the separation is for cause.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>But where the cause of the separation is more serious than mere
inefficiency, the generosity of the law must be more discerning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt it is compassionate to give
separation pay to a salesman if he is dismissed for his inability to fill his
quota but surely he does not deserve such generosity if his offense is
misappropriation of the receipts of his sales.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is no longer mere incompetence but clear dishonesty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A security guard found sleeping on the job is
doubtless subject to dismissal but may be allowed separation pay since his
conduct, while inept, is not depraved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But if he was in fact not really sleeping but sleeping with a prostitute
during his tour of duty and in the company premises, the situation is changed
completely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not only
inefficiency but immorality and the grant of separation pay would be entirely
unjustified. (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The social justice policy mandates a compassionate attitude
toward the working class in its relations with management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in calling for the protection of labor,
the Constitution does not condone wrongdoing by the employee, it nevertheless
urges a moderation of the sanctions that may be applied to him in the light of
the many disadvantages that weigh heavily on him like an albatross hanging from
his neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Management must look upon the
working class with sympathy, remembering that they are equal partners joined in
a common venture whose success should redound to their mutual benefit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should regard each other in a spirit of
amity and trust, not with closed hands but with open <span class="GramE">arms,
that</span> they may endeavor better together.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is partly GRANTED, and the private
respondent is DIRECTED to pay separation pay to the petitioner as above
indicated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
