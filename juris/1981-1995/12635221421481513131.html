A proceeding for review on <em>certiorari </em>of the Decision of 
respondent Court of Tax Appeals in CTA Case No. 3201, which reversed the
 Decision of petitioner, the Acting Commissioner of Customs, decreeing 
the forfeiture of various foreign currencies found in the possession of 
private respondent (Charles Joseph Andrulis) for violation of Central 
Bank Circular No. 534, in relation to section 2530(f) of the Revised 
Tariff and Customs Code.
<p>
On 20 February 1980, Andrulis representing himself as an American 
businessman "on joint ventures with his Filipino counterparts", arrived 
in Manila and checked in at the Century Park Sheraton Hotel.  Two days 
later, or on 22 February 1980, he left the hotel surreptitiously without
 paying for his bills in the amount of P2,000.00.  Col. Felix Zerrudo, 
Chief Security Officer of the Hotel, timely discovered the scheduled 
departure of Andrulis on that same day, and immediately tipped-off the 
Customs authorities on Andrulis' intention to abscond.  At the Manila 
International Airport (MIA), the Customs authorities looked for Andrulis
 from among the passengers who were already on board Philippine Airlines
 Flight No. 501 bound for Singapore.  Apprehensive, Andrulis locked 
himself inside the airplane's comfort room.  In the course of 
negotiations for him to come out, he slipped through an opening bills 
worth US$300.00.  Andrulis finally yielded to the authorities and 
surrendered the luggage he was carrying which, when opened by the 
authorities, contained various foreign currencies consisting of 
US$59,639.00; 53,100 Indonesian Rupiah, and Singapore $308.00.
</p><p>
A criminal charge was filed before the Office of the City Fiscal, Pasay 
City, for violation of CB Circular No. 534 in relation to RA 265, the 
Central Bank Charter.  On 10 March 1980, the Assistant City Fiscal 
dismissed the charge on the rationalization that the Government had 
failed to present evidence that the currencies were not brought in by 
Andrulis.
</p><p>
Proceedings for the seizure of the foreign currencies were also 
commenced at the Customs Office of the MIA in Pasay City, docketed as 
Seizure Identification No. 416280.
</p><p>
During the hearing, Andrulis submitted the case for resolution on the basis of the following documentary evidence:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.     Sworn Affidavit of Charles Joseph Andrulis, stating that the foreign exchange in question are owned by claimant; </p>
  <p> "2.     Resolution of the City Fiscal of Pasay City in I.S. No. 
80-94112, entitled MIA Customhouse vs. Charles Joseph Andrulis, 
dismissing the alleged charge of violation of Central Bank Circular No. 
534, in relation to Central Bank Circular No. 265, to show that there 
was no violation as charged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For its part, the prosecution submitted the case on the basis of the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A.  Affidavit of Col. Felix A. Zerrudo (Ret.) Chief Security 
Officer of the Century Park Sheraton-Manila Hotel, executed on February 
29, 1980; </p>
  <p> “B.  Certification issued by Col. Felix A. Zerrudo (Ret.) dated February 29, 1980; </p>
  <p> “C.  Certification of Mr. Domingo J. Galicia, Acting Credit Manager of the Manila Hotel dated February 28, 1980; </p>
  <p> “D.  Letter of Demand dated July 9, 1979 issued by Robert L. 
Maniquiz, Credit and Collection Manager of the Resort Hotels Corporation
 addressed to Mr. Charles Andrulis; </p>
  <p> "E.  Sworn statement dated February 22, 1980 of Mr. Ramonchito 
Liongson, a Customs Officer, who apprehended the various foreign 
currencies herein subject to seizure."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Items "C" and "D" above-listed tended to show that Andrulis had, on 
previous occasions, also tried to abscond without payment of his bills 
from the Manila Hotel and the Pines Hotel in Baguio.
</p><p>
On 3 June 1980, the Acting District Collector of Customs rendered a 
Decision, which found Andrulis to have violated Central Bank Circular 
No. 534 in relation to section 2530(f) of the Tariff and Customs Code, 
and decreed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    WHEREFORE, by authority of law vested in this Office, it is ordered 
and decreed that the various foreign currencies confiscated from herein 
claimant, covered by SID No. 4162-80 be, as they are hereby declared 
forfeited in favor of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines,
 the same to be turned over to the Central Bank of the Philippines and 
exchanged with their equivalent in Philippine pesos which shall be 
deposited with the National Treasury and accounted for as Customs 
receipts.
  </p>
  <p> "Let copies of this Decision be furnished all offices and parties concerned for their information and guidance. </p>
  <p> "The Chief, Auction and Cargo Disposal Division, this Customhouse, shall inform this Office of the action taken hereon. </p>
  <p> "SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Andrulis appealed to the Acting Commissioner of Customs, who affirmed the same.
</p><p>
On 23 January 1981, Andrulis filed a Notice of Appeal and on 16 February
 1981, a Petition for Review with the Court of Tax Appeals, docketed as 
CTA Case No. 3201.  On 30 June 1982, respondent Court reversed the 
appealed Decision on the theory that the legal presumption of ownership 
has to be accorded the possessor of the res, who need not be obliged to 
show or prove it pursuant to Section 5(j) of Rule 131 of the Rules of 
Court and Article 541 of the Civil Code.  The dispositive portion of the
 CTA Decision decreed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed and respondent 
ordered to effect the restitution of the forfeited currencies to 
petitioner.  No pronouncement as to costs. </p>
  <p> "SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On 10 September 1982, petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration on 
the principal ground that respondent Court had failed to consider that 
claimant Andrulis had the burden of proof to show that the foreign 
currencies seized from him were brought into the Philippines by him.  
The motion was denied on 2 December 1982.  Hence, the instant Petition 
for Review on <em>Certiorari </em>by the Acting Commissioner of Customs represented by the Solicitor General.
</p><p>
The pertinent legal provisions provide:
</p><p>
"Section 3.  Unless specifically authorized by the Central Bank or 
allowed under existing international agreements or Central Bank 
regulations, no person shall take or attempt to take or transmit foreign
 exchanges, in any form, out of the Philippines, directly, through other
 persons, through mails, or through international carriers."
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The provisions of this section shall not apply to tourists and 
non-resident temporary visitors who are taking or sending out of the 
Philippines their own foreign exchange brought in by them." (CB Circular
 No. 534) </p>
  <p> "Section 2530.  <em>Property Subject to Forfeiture Under Tariff and Customs Law</em>.
  - Any vehicle, vessel or aircraft, cargo, article and other objects 
shall, under the following condition be subject to forfeiture: </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">xxx</span></p>
  <p> (f)   Any article the importation or <em>exportation of which is effected or attempted contrary to law</em>,
 or any article of prohibited importation or exportation, and all other 
articles which, in the opinion of the Collector, have been used, are or 
were entered to be used as instruments in the importation or exportation
 of the former."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  (Italics supplied)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his defense, private respondent seeks refuge behind the exception in 
the aforequoted CB Circular No. 534 giving tourists the right to take 
out of the Philippines their own foreign exchange brought in by them.  
Private respondent also relies heavily on his acquittal in the criminal 
charge filed against him for violation of CB Circular No. 534.
</p><p>
The core issue is who has the burden of proof in seizure or forfeiture 
proceedings?  The applicable law, Section 2535 of the Tariff and Customs
 Code, is explicit in this regard.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC.  2535.  <em>Burden of Proof in Seizure and/or Forfeiture</em>.
  - In all proceedings taken for the seizure and/or forfeiture of any 
vehicle, vessel, aircraft, beast or articles under the provisions of the
 tariff and customs laws, <em>the burden of proof shall lie upon the claimant:</em>
  Provided, That probable cause shall be first shown for the institution
 of such proceedings and that seizure and/or forfeiture was made under 
the circumstances and in the manner described in the preceding sections 
of this Code"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  (Italics ours).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Upon the facts of the case, the requirement of the law that the 
existence of probable cause should first be shown before filing of the 
forfeiture proceedings, had been fully met.  When Andrulis was 
apprehended at the MIA and was found to have in his possession the 
various foreign currencies, he could not produce the required Central 
Bank authorization allowing him to bring them out of the country.  This 
constituted <em>prima facie</em> evidence of infringement of the 
provisions of CB Circular No. 534 and provided sufficient basis for the 
seizure of the said foreign exchange.  Probable cause having been shown,
 the burden of proof was upon Andrulis to establish that he fell within 
the purview of the exception prescribed in the second paragraph of the 
aforequoted Section 3 of CB Circular No. 534 in that he actually brought
 into the country the foreign currencies and was just taking them out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  This burden, Andrulis had failed to satisfactorily discharge.  The 
legal presumption in Section 5(j), Rule 131 of the Rules of Court and 
Article 541 of the Civil Code, relied upon by respondent Court, are of a
 general character and cannot prevail over the specific provisions of 
the Tariff and Customs Code.
</p><p>
Aside from Andrulis’ suspicious actuations when about to be apprehended 
on board the plane, which cast doubt on his alleged bona fide possession
 of the foreign currencies, his bare assertion in his Affidavit, 
claiming that "he came into the country with the intention of investing 
here and of going into joint ventures with local counterparts"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
 , has not been corroborated by other convincing evidence.  The 
observations of the Solicitor General on this point finds relevance:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "If it was really his intention to invest, he could have presented
 documents to support his assertion.  He could have produced papers 
required by the Government of foreigners intending to invest in the 
Philippines.  He could have presented as witnesses Filipino businessmen 
with whom he entered into joint ventures or at least discussed the 
prospects thereof.  He could at the least have revealed the nature of 
the business he intended to engage in, the capital requirements thereof,
 the situs of the business, the form of the entity he intended to form 
to carry on the business, etc.  He had done none of these. </p>
  <p> "Private respondent implies that the foreign currencies seized 
from him were intended to be invested in business ventures in the 
Philippines.  If this is so, why was it necessary for him to have three 
kinds of currencies:  US dollars, Indonesian Rupiah and Singapore 
dollars.  Besides, businessmen usually do not personally carry the cash 
which they intend to invest.  They remit them through the banks."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Andrulis' acquittal in the criminal charge before the City Fiscal's Office does not operate as <em>res judicata</em> in a seizure or forfeiture proceeding.  A distinction exists between the proceedings before the Fiscal which are <em>in personam </em>since they are directed against the owner or holder of the thing; whereas, a forfeiture proceeding is one <em>in rem</em> directed against the thing itself.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "There is a split of authority as to whether a former conviction 
of a criminal offense based upon the same facts amounts to a bar.  x x x
 The authorities are by no means agreed, however, that a prior 
conviction for a criminal charge bars an action for a forfeiture of 
property.  Thus, it has been held that since the forfeiture proceedings 
is one <em>in rem</em> under which the offense is attached primarily to 
the thing rather than the offender, the forfeiture proceedings stands 
independent of, and wholly unaffected by, any criminal proceeding <em>in personam </em>and is not barred by a conviction of the individual under a criminal charge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In a similar vein, it was also held in C.F. Sharp &amp; Co., Inc. vs. 
Commissioner of Customs, 22 SCRA 765 (1968) that the result of criminal 
proceedings in a separate case before a different tribunal, being 
dependent upon the evidence adduced therein, would not necessarily 
influence the judgment in a forfeiture proceeding.
</p><p>
Finally, Andrulis contends that no foreign currency declaration is 
required of any incoming or outgoing passenger and that it is not the 
intention of the Government to entrap unwary foreigners.  True, 
Resolution No. 594, dated 14 April 1969, of the Monetary Board, 
provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Henceforth, no currency declaration of any kind shall be required either from outgoing or incoming passengers."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, tourists are not precluded from submitting proof, other than a 
currency declaration, to show the legitimate source of the currency in 
their possession.  Besides, Resolution No. 594 must be deemed superseded
 by Resolution No. 1412, dated 16 July 1976, which requires that persons
 taking or transmitting or attempting to take or transmit foreign 
exchange out of the Philippines must have authorization from the Central
 Bank allowing them to do so.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the Decision of respondent Court of Tax Appeals, promulgated 
on 30 June 1982, is hereby reversed and set aside, and the Decision of 
the Acting Commissioner of Customs, dated 15 December 1980, hereby 
ordered reinstated.  No costs.
