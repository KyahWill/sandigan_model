Charged and convicted of the crime of murder by the then Court of First 
Instance of Palawan, the two (2) accused, Adriano Cañete and Jose Bilog,
 were both sentenced to the maximum penalty of death, and to pay jointly
 and severally the heirs of the deceased, Douglas Bilog, in the sum of 
P12,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to 
pay proportional costs.
<p>
The People's version of the facts is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Accused Jose Bilog and Douglas Bilog were brothers.  They were 
owners of adjoining ricelands adjacent to the Inagawan Sub-Colony at 
Puerto Princesa, Palawan (p. 10, tsn, Jan. 4. 1973, Anonas).  They were 
not in good terms and always quarreled because Jose resented the fact 
that Douglas has received .a bigger share of the lands inherited from 
their parents.  (pp. 12, 20, tsn., Anonas). </p>
  <p> The ire of Jose against his brother became unbearable that on or 
about April 28, 1971, he got his father's shotgun and waylaid Douglas at
 the bridge leading their house.  A tragic incident was averted only 
when Concepcion, the wife of Douglas, in­formed her uncle, Cervancia, of
 Jose's evil scheme.  Cervancia imme­diately went after Jose and 
succeeded in retrieving the gun from the latter and tried to settle 
their differences (p. 10, tsn, Anonas). </p>
  <p> Through the intercession of Mr. Aniceto Gamo, a Chief of Section 
in the Inagawan Sub-Colony, Jose Bilog had allowed his farm to be worked
 by Nicasio Dayao, a prisoner at the Colony (pp. 4-5, 13, tsn, Duero).  
Sometime in May, 1971 while Dayao was working in the ricefield, Jose 
Bilog offered him P300.00 if he (Dayao) would kill Douglas.  Dayao asked
 Jose Bilog why he wanted his brother liquidated.  Jose replied that 
Douglas poisoned their mother and if Douglas would not be liquid­ated he
 (Douglas) would eventually kill all of them in the family (p. 7 tsn., 
Duero).  Dayao rejected the proposal and offer of reward.  He explained 
to Jose that he could not kill Douglas because he has many children to 
think about (p. 8, tsn., Duero). </p>
  <p>
  On April 19, 1972, at about 5:00 p.m., Concepcion Bilog saw from the 
window of their house in the ricefield, Jose Bilog riding on a bicycle 
going towards the ricefield.  On that occasion she saw Jose Bilog 
converse with two colonists (pp. 6-7, 10, tsn., Jan. 4, 1973, Anonas).
  </p>
  <p>
  Almost at the same time on that day, Angel Rebong, a prisoner of the 
colony was sent by Aniceto Gamo to get some palay from Roming, who lived
 near the ricefield of Jose Bilog (p. 53, tsn., Duero).  On the highway,
 Angel Rebong met Jose Bilog who was then riding a bicycle.  Jose told 
him not to mention to anybody what he might see in the ricefield (pp. 
35, 49,53, tsn., Duero).  Angel, however, did not see anything unusual 
in the ricefield so he went directly to the house of Roming.  He left 
Roming's place at about 6:00 p.m. and reported to Mr. Gamo that he 
failed to get the palay.  Thereafter, he returned to the General 
Services Barracks in the colony's compound.  He reached his hut at about
 7:00 p.m.  (pp. 36-37, tsn., Duero).
  </p>
  <p> At about 5:00 o'clock that same afternoon, Antonio Cabig, an 
inmate of the Colony was on his way from the Colony's PX to the Coconut 
Division (pp. 64-65, tsn, Duero).  He passed the ricefield of Jose Bilog
 and saw Douglas and Jose drinking wine in the latter's hut.  They were 
seated in front of a table with about five bottles of 'Cuatro Cantos' 
gin on it (p. 92, tsn., Duero).  When Cabig was 3 or 4 meters from the 
hut, Douglas saw him and offered him a drink.  He accepted the drink but
 stayed outside the hut (pp. 68, 93, tsn., Duero).  Not long thereafter,
 two persons arrived and joined the drinking party.  Appellant Adriano 
Cañete also arrived and joined the group.  He sat beside Jose Bilog (pp.
 90, 93, tsn., Id.). </p>
  <p> When those around the table were already drunk, Jose (Boy) Bilog 
stood up and drew from his waist a 'laring', a bladed instru­ment about 
1-1/2 feet long.  Sudden­ly, Jose stabbed Douglas at the front part of 
his body (pp. 75, 77, 114, tsn., Id.).  Cabig witnessed the incident, 
but could not tell how many stab blows Jose Bilog delivered.  He noticed
 that the knife embedded in Douglas' body.  At this juncture, Cañete got
 hold of the knife and stabbed Douglas on the stomach (p. 144, tsn., 
Id.).  Douglas stood up and fought his assailants with karate blows (p. 
118, tsn., Id.).  The two persons who had arrived earlier helped Jose 
and Cañete by hitting Douglas with a piece of wood.  When Boy Bilog 
called for assistance, a colonist, one Roming, came and helped them 
until Douglas fell dead.  The victim was then dumped in a nearby canal. 
 Cañete got the 'laring' and proceeded to the Colony's brigade with it 
(p. 140, tsn., Duero). </p>
  <p> When Angel Rebong arrived in his hut, Dugguan Abao, his hutmate, 
informed him that appellant Adriano Cañete came to their hut with 
blooded clothes.  Cañete got Angel's clothes and wore them and left his 
blooded clothes (pp. 37-38, tsn., Duero).  Angel then left for the 
General Ser­vices Barracks because he was to perform guard duty at 8:00 
p.m.  There he saw appellant Cañete wear­ing his black pants and Vonnel 
T-Shirt.  The latter told him that he got his (Angel's) clothes be­cause
 he had no clothes to wear (pp. 39, 44, 59, tsn., Duero). </p>
  <p> On April 27, 1972, police investigators received information about
 the persons seen at the scene of the crime prior to its commission.  
They took into custody Adriano Cañete and Angel Rebong and brought them 
to Puerto Princesa for inter­rogation.  When they reached Puerto 
Princesa, Adriano Cañete informed Angel Rebong that he killed Douglas 
Bilog (p. 57, tsn., Duero).  Upon investigation, appellant Cañete 
readily admitted that he together with Jose Bilog, Pedro Macabihag and 
Ramon Dealogo killed Douglas Bilog.  Cañete then voluntarily gave a 
written statement.  (Exhibit "C"; pp. 157, 158-159, tsn. Duero).  Later,
 he led Sgt. Maduro to his quarters in the Colony and surren­dered the 
fatal knife (pp. 162, 180, tsn., Id.).  On June 22, 1972 Cañete gave 
another statement.  This time he stated that only he and Jose Bilog had a
 hand in the killing of Douglas (p. 177, tsn., Duero). </p>
  <p> Dr. Oscar Magtang, Rural Health Physician at Puerto Princesa, 
Palawan conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of Douglas Bilog.  He found 
26 injuries, twenty-four (24) of which were incised and stab wounds 
scattered all over the body, particularly on the face, head, chest, 
abdomen, back, arms, and fingers of both hands.  There were abrasions on
 the neck and lower abdomen.  Death was due to severe hemorrhage (pp. 
55-58, tsn. Anonas).  Dr. Magtang made a written report, Exhibit "F" (p.
 53, tsn. Id.).  According to said doctor, the most severe of these 
wounds were those inflicted on the left mammary region of the chest 
going vertically downward and injuring the heart, and the stab wound on 
the abdomen (pp. 60-61, tsn., Anonas). </p>
  <p> Adela Pereyna, Chief, Record and Document Section and Parcel 
Investigation, of the Iwahig Penal Colony testified that per records in 
her custody Adriano Cañete was convicted by the Court of First Instance 
of Cebu of robbery on September 7, 1960; that he transferred to Davao 
Penal Colony for work assignment bearing Serial No. 34831-P; that he 
escaped while serving sentence on January 10, 1963, but was captured and
 recommitted to prison on the following day; that he escaped again on 
April 7, 1964; that on August 6, 1966, he was committed to the Iwahig 
Penal Colony after having been convicted of robbery by the Court of 
First Instance of Ormoc City; that because he did not reveal his 
identity, he was included in the list of new arrivals and given serial 
No. 55791­P; that at the Verification and Identification Section, his 
identity was established as the same Adriano Cañete who was previously 
given Serial No. 34831-P and who escaped from the Davao Penal Colony on 
April 7, 1964; that he was prosecuted for evasion of sentence in the 
Davao Court of First Instance with the aggravating circumstance of 
recidivism; and, that his term of sentence Davao Court of First Instance
 with the aggravating circumstance of recidivism; and, that his term of 
sentence was due to expire on August 23, 1975 (pp. 41-43, tsn, April 16,
 1973, Anonas; Exh. "D", p. 109, Rec)." (pp. 4-10, Appellee's Brief). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant Adriano Cañete assails the decision against him and submits 
that the lower court erred (1) in not rejecting his extra-judicial 
confession, Exhibit "C", notwithstanding that the case was merely 
concocted, incredible and in conflict with the People's evidence; (2) in
 not finding that there were at least seven (7) possibilities or 
versions as to who committed the crime and in not acquitting him on 
reasonable doubt; (3) in finding that the crime was committed in 
conspiracy with the attendance of evident premeditation, price, 
treachery and in not finding that Cañete should have been found guilty 
only of physical injuries or at most homicide.
</p><p>
On the other hand, appellant Jose Bilog claims that the lower court 
erred (1) in giving credit to the testi­mony of prosecution witness 
Antonio Cabig, notwithstanding that said witness is "known to be a 
confirmed degenerate and an admitted perjurer"; (2) in disregarding his 
defense of alibi; and (3) in not acquitting him on reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
Appellant Cañete submits that the extra-judicial admission, Exhibit "C",
 should have been disregarded, not due to violence in the taking 
thereof, but on the ground that the same had been successfully explained
 by him; that the contents thereof were merely concocted and this is 
supported by the evidence of the prosecution; that aside from the 
irreconciliable conflict between what is contained in his extra-judicial
 confession and what prosecution witness Antonio Cabig testified in 
court, said extra-judicial confession contains statements which are 
strikingly incredible; and that the credibility of prosecution witness 
Cabig as to the participation of appellant Cañete in the killing of 
Douglas Bilog is doubtful.
</p><p>
The contention is utterly without merit.  The findings of the trial 
court is entitled to great weight that Cañete's retraction was merely a 
last minute effort at exculpation, considering that his extra-judicial 
con­fession, Exhibit "C", given in April 1972, was freely and 
voluntarily given.  The fact is, there was no evidence presented that 
said confession was obtained as a result of violence, torture, 
intimidation or promise of reward or leniency, nor that the 
investigating officer could have been motivated to concoct facts 
narrated in said confession.
</p><p>
Besides, even with the exclusion of said Exhibit "C", there is the 
testimony of Antonio Cabig who witnessed the incident from the time Jose
 Bilog stabbed his brother on his breast up to the time Douglas fell 
after receiving the thrust of Cañete.  Hereunder is Cabig's testimony 
regarding the horrifying incident:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “Q   You said that Douglas Bilog was killed, do you know the persons who killed </p>

    A     Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    (TSN, pp. 77-78, January 8, 1973 hearing)
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Likewise, appellant Jose Bilog's alibi cannot pre­vail over the positive
 identification of Cabig.  He points out that on the day of the 
incident, April 19, 1972, he was in his house doing household chores as 
his wife was in Puerto Princesa doing some marketing.  On this score, 
the lower court rightfully observed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Jose Bilog's alibi has no merit.  His house is but three 
kilometers away from the place of the in­cident and he was seen by the 
widow of the deceased leaving his house on a bicycle about 4:00 o'clock 
that afternoon.  At 5:00 o'clock, he was met by Angel Rebong at the 
highway while riding his bicycle and at 6:00 o'clock late in the 
afternoon, Antonio Cabig saw him drinking liquor with the deceased in 
his hut in the banana plantation (pp. 154-155, Rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The defense of alibi cannot be believed where the distance between two 
barrios is only eight kilometers and can be traversed by walking one and
 one-half hour.  (People vs. Manangan, L-32733, Sept. 11, 1974, 59 SCRA 
31).  (pp. 9-10, Appellee's Brief).
</p><p>
Aside from the fact that courts exercise great caution in accepting 
alibi because it is easily concocted, it may be proper to repeat what 
one author said about alibi as a defense:  "it is a reason with a bad 
reputation.”
</p><p>
Again, We agree with the findings of the trial court that "while Jose 
Bilog tried to shift the blame at Cañete, Cañete too wanted the Court to
 believe that it was Jose Bilog who did the heinous act.  Repudiating 
his confession, Cañete tried to convince the Court that he was simply 
offered P1,000.00 in consideration of his admission of the crime.  On 
cross-examination, however, Cañete slipped and admitted that the 
P1,000.00 consider­ation was offered for him to execute the killing.  It
 is therefore evident that cañete's testimony disowning the crime is but
 a last minute attempt at exculpation."
</p><p>
The killing of Douglas Bilog was qualified by treachery because the 
attack was unexpected and sudden, and the victim had no chance to defend
 himself.  Like­wise, the aggravating circumstance of price was present 
in the commission of the crime and this affects not only the person who 
received the money or the reward but also the person who gave it.  
(People vs. Tailedo, 58 Phil. 539).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED but, for lack of 
necessary votes, the sentence is modified in that both appellants shall 
each suffer Reclusion Perpetua only, and shall indemnify, jointly and 
severally, the heirs of Douglas Bilog in the sum of P30,000.00.  Costs 
against both appellants.
