<blockquote>"The claim of amorous advances made by the complainant to the
accused is quite out of this world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the traditional modesty of Filipina women, this Court
considers it exceedingly hard to believe that a country lass of about 14 or 15
years isolated from the incidents of pornography and smut films would be so
pervaded by immorality and immodesty as to make advances to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>married man triple her age, there
being nothing extraordinarily irresistible on the accused in this case who has
neither the physique of Steve Reeves nor the looks of Alain <span class="SpellE">Delon</span>."
(p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The corroborating declarations of defense witnesses utterly
failed to counteract the evidence of the prosecution, particularly
complainant's testimony and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Casañada's</span> medical report and testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote with approval the able dissertation

afternoon of the day of the incident the complainant had her arm around the
waist of the accused and the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">had
</span>one of his arms on the shoulder of the complaining-witness, the latter
helping the former in walking because he was drunk, is not entitled to credit
as one proceeding from a biased source.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The biasness of the witness was betrayed when on questions by the court
as to the date when he saw the accused and the complaining-witness he asserted
that he consulted his calendar after the two (2) had left and when pressed
further for the reason why he consulted the <span class="SpellE">calender</span>,
he asserted that he might be asked about the date in Court as he found it queer
that the accused was with another woman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Darlito</span> <span class="SpellE">Genton</span>, who was listed in the information as a witness for
the prosecution but who testified subsequently for the defense, is open to
suspicion because he was hesitant in answering question on the witness stand
and his general appearance was one of fear and hesitancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He disclaimed knowledge of the contents of
his sworn statement which had been marked as Exhibit 'E', claiming that he does
not know the contents thereof because he signed the same at the instruction of
the policeman who made it without having read it and without the same having
been read to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the professed
lack of knowledge of the contents of said statement, however, he asserted that
said contents are false and are at variance with what he testified in
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How this is possible despite his
claim that nobody coached him nor told him about the contents of his sworn
statement is beyond the comprehension of this court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of Julio <span class="SpellE">Genton</span>, who
claimed that when he saw the complaining witness and the accused on the evening
in question the accused was drunk and was being propped up by the
complaining-witness, is also open to doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This witness admitted that he saw the two from a distance of about two
(2) <span class="GramE">arms-length</span> from the balcony of their house at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> in the evening and they did
not stay long because after he refused to receive them they immediately
left.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There having been no conversation
other than the request for shelter for the night and the refusal, after which
the accused and the appellant left, the latter did not therefore stay in the
yard of the witness for long, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>matter
admitted by the witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the witness, as admitted by him, was reading by lamplight when he heard
his name being called by the accused and immediately thereafter he peeped thru
the window and proceeded to the balcony where he saw the accused and his
companion in the yard, his eyes, which were adopted to the brightness of the
light under which he was then reading, labored in the darkness as admitted by
him when he went to the balcony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
being elementary that a sudden switch of the eyes from brightness to darkness
would occasion a blurred vision, the pretension that the witness saw the
complainant propping up the accused on the night in question which happened to
be moonless, is open to doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
doubt is not cured in any way by the evasiveness of the witness when asked
about whether the accused was also holding on to the complaining-witness at the
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He professed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">having seen </span>the complaining-witness
holding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>accused with two (2)
hands but failed to see whether the accused was also holding unto the
complaining-witness at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
evasiveness if anything shows biasness." (pp. 25-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The first three (3)
assigned errors raise, in general, the question of credibility of the
prosecution witnesses and the sufficiency of their testimonies to prove
appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Appellant contends it was
impossible for him to have abducted complainant at a place which is near the
gate leading to his residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="GramE">We</span> find to be without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's house is about fifty (50) meters from the place where he
forcibly brought complainant and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">one's
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">view was obstructed by coconut
trees and bushes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fact </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">is, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">there is sufficient evidence of abuse upon complainant and the place of
commission is immaterial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
was only 14 years old at the time and with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">knife poked at her,
with threat to be killed if she would not follow what he said, it is not
surprising that she was scared to death and, therefore, had to obey.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That some did notice the unusual situation
complainant was in at the time and did not do anything to help her is
understandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the natural
reaction </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">people who did not want to be involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon her release, however, she immediately
reported the matter to the authorities and to her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These actuations, which are part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>, command
strong probative value considering that it was made by the offended party to
the persons who, </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">cases of
this nature, were the most logical ones to seek redress from.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The claim of appellant
that he was drunk at the time was denied by complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, assuming that he was drunk, it is of
common knowledge that a person in that condition is more aggressive and capable
of having carnal knowledge with the opposite sex.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The fact that complainant
did not sustain any injury is no argument that she was not abused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The truth is, she was not given fist blows;
but, she was intimidated and threatened with a knife and that was sufficient
for a 14-year old girl not to resist at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rape may be committed even if no force was used; intimidation is
sufficient, and this includes the moral kind such as the fear caused by
threatening a girl with a knife or pistol (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Garcines</span>,
57 SCRA 653).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the absence
of spermatozoa does not disprove the consummation of rape, the important
consideration being, not the emission of semen, but penetration (People vs.
Jose, 37 SCRA 450; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Carangdang</span>, 52 SCRA
259).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">With respect to the
fourth assigned error that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over
the case because the complaint filed with the municipal court did </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">state that <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
Herrera is the father of <span class="SpellE">Evelita</span> Herrera is not
tenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that when
the offended party is a minor, the father may file a complaint under Article
344 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
father has the custody of the person of the minor and owes to her all the legal
obligations of maintenance, care and protection growing out of that
relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The omission of
relationship in the complaint </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">is,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">if at all, a formal, not a
jurisdictional defect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The last assigned error
need not be discussed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conviction is the
necessary consequence considering that the presumption </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">innocence in favor of the accused-appellant
has been successfully overthrown by the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
