leveled against him, the accused-appellant has inextricably ensnared himself in
<span style="">a </span>confusion of lies that has

have been warned, although these words would have<span style=""> been alien to him:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The victim was a 68-year old woman who, despite her age, was
still working at her small store at the Daraga Public Market in Albay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="10">October
 30, 1984</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">seven o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, she was waylaid and stabbed for refusing to part with the
handbag she was carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One hour
later, Josefa Milallos was dead.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1985</st1:date>,
an information for robbery with homicide was filed against Francisco de Guzman
and Arjun Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge carried the
allegation that de Guzman was a recidivist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After trial, the <span style="">accused-appellant
was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment and to pay civil indemnity
in the sum of P30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also
required to restore the value of the things stolen from the victim in the total
amount of P1,900.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez was acquitted
on </span>the <span style="">ground that there was
absolutely no evidence against him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, de Guzman claims he had been mistakenly
identified and that he was nowhere at the scene of the crime when it was
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal witness for the prosecution was Maybel Millena, who
was with her grandmother at the time of the fatal assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This 16-year old girl testified that, after
locking up for the day in question, she and her Lola left the market and
proceeded for home, taking the route on <st1:street><st1:address>Gen. Luna St</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they neared the <st1:place><st1:placename>Ludovice</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, a man emerged from behind
a post near a garbage can and approached them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without much ado, he detained her Lola by her right hand even as he
tried to unsling the handbag the old woman was carrying over her shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her grandmother resisted and the man said,
"Hold-up yadi!" (This is a hold-up!"), at the same time drawing <span style="">a </span>knife from
his waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Terrified, Maybel started to
run but after covering a distance of only five meters she went back as she
could not leave her grandmother behind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By then, however, the man was already fleeing with her Lola's handbag
and the old woman was bloody from her wounds.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her Lola said the fleeing man had stabbed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybel and two men took the fallen victim to
the nearby hospital but it was too <span style="">late.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The three stab wounds on her chest had
drained her life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">a </span>sworn statement she made at the Daraga police station on
November 6, 1984, Maybel described her grandmother's killer as "more or
less 5'5" in height, medium build, fair complexion, slightly curly hair,
with mustache, limp (pilay), wearing whit T-shirt and maong pants."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1985</st1:date>,
when she was asked to look at a police line-up of twelve detainees, she readily
pointed to the accused-appellant <span style="">as </span>the man who had attacked her grandmother.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its brief, the defense argues that Maybel could not have
remembered all the items of the killer's appearance during the short period she
saw him that night, <span style="">more so since she </span>was
<span style="">terrified of her own life at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is one viewpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is possible that the
incident and all its gory details, including the description of the man who
killed her grandmother, were etched in her mind because of their traumatic
impact.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court approves the following conclusions of Judge Antonio A.
Arcangel of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Legazpi</st1:placename>

<blockquote>This Court is bent to believe the
prosecution that accused Francisco de Guzman y de Dios <span style="">was </span>indeed the heartless culprit who robbed and killed the
68-year old woman last October 30, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For one, he was positively identified by Maybelle Millena who had no
doubt about his identity because she claimed the accused, when running <span style="">away, </span>was illuminated by the lights
of the electric post, the pub house and the very bright Shell gasoline station
where the accused ran towards in trying to escape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But what convinced this court about the
identity of the accused Francisco de Guzman y de Dios is the fact that as <span style="">early </span>as November 6, 1984, when
Maybelle's sworn testimony was taken by the police of Daraga, which was more
than two weeks before the accused was seen by her in the Tabaco Municipal Jail,
Maybelle already clearly described the culprit as more or less 5'5" in
height, medium built, fair complexioned, slightly curly hair, with moustache,
limp (pilay), wearing white T-shirt and maong pants (Exh. I-D).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This description of the culprit on November
6, 1984 matched substantially and strikingly with the description of the
accused Francisco de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused de
Guzman says he is 5'7 1/2" while Maybelle <span style="">says </span>he is 5'5" in height which is a negligible difference
and could be excusable considering that that was only an approximation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused de Guzman is observed by this court
to have wavy hair which fits the description and that he was slightly
curly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Accused tried to conceal this by
having his hair cut very short during the hearing); accused de Guzman has a
moustache which he admits he sports but had it shaven before he testified; he
is medium built, fair complexioned, and above all, he limps on his left
leg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also tried to hide his limp and
even denied having scar on his left leg although he subsequently changed his
mind and admitted his leg injury which he claimed was caused by Pat. Berchez <span style="">of </span>Tabaco who shot him before October
30, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above descriptions
dovetail with each other, and are just too glaring to be overlooked in
revealing the true identity of Francisco de Guzman as the real culprit.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">De Guzman testified that he was at Rawis, Legazpi City, at the
time the offense was committed and that he went to Daraga only at about nine
o'clock in the evening of October 30, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We choose not to believe him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the first place, Daraga is only about five to six kilometers <span style="">away </span>from Rawis and can be reached in
twenty minutes by <span style="">public motor
transportation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, he
did not even present a single corroborating witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worst of all, his own sworn statements show
that </span>he <span style="">is, in the trial judge's
words, "an inveterate liar" whose own falsities have condemned him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He denied ever having been convicted of robbery only to be
confronted with the decision finding him guilty of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He denied having been imprisoned in other cases but later admitted he had been
jailed for the crime of assault.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He denied he had a scar on his left leg when in fact he had not one but two
scars on that leg.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">He pretended not to limp but said later
he was limping because he had earlier been shot in the leg by a </span>policeman.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He also said he had been manhandled while under detention and even sustained
"broken ribs"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
but did not complain earlier about <span style="">his </span>injuries
or submit to medical treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
also noteworthy that before the trial, he had his hair cut short and shaved off
his mustache so he would not fit Maybel's description of the killer.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the accused-appellant's defense was properly
rejected by the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
positive identification by Maybel, who was with her grandmother when she was
stabbed, and, no less important, his own flawed statements under oath, not to
mention his other evasive acts, served only to reveal his deceptive
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt at all that
he <span style="">was </span>the person who robbed
and killed Josefa Milallos in the evening of October 30, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was correct in approving the claim for the stolen
property, consisting of a ring and earrings, the value of which was established
without contravention at P1,600.00 by the victim's son, Alfredo Milallos, and
of the P<span style="">200.00 </span>in the bag, plus
the bag itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the civil indemnity must be increased from P30,000.00 <span style="">to P50,000.00 in accordance with the
resolution of this Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dated August 30, 1990.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the age and relative defenselessness of Josefa
Milallos and the peacefulness of her humble pursuits, one cannot but be
saddened over the violent way her life was ended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalties imposed upon the heartless
killer seem disproportionate to his terrible deed, which cruelly and needlessly
denied a harmless old woman the serenity of her declining years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is AFFIRMED as modified,
with costs against the accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
