in the former Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del

however, after an evaluation of the evidence on record, convicted appellant as
charged and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, "with a strong <span style="">recommendation for executive clemency."
Appellant was further ordered to pay P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime
before 9:00 o'clock </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the evening of </span>September 6, 1981, complainant <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span>
Montes, then fifteen (15) years old, was alone in their house near the national
highway at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Balili</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte,
feeding pigs while her parents were at their farmhouse about two (2) kilometers
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After performing her chores, she
decided to join her parents at said farmhouse.</p>

<p class="BODY">On her way along a "human trail," complainant noticed a
man walking very fast towards her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
prompted her to walk faster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before
long, however, the man who turned out to be the appellant overtook her, blocked
her way and immediately held her right shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As complainant struggled to free herself and
continue walking, appellant tripped her causing <span style="">her to fall to the ground.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, appellant placed himself on <span class="GramE">top</span> of
her, threatened her with a hunting knife and ordered her not to shout or else
he would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then grabbed her
short pants and tore the portion covering her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he ripped her panties also at</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">"<span class="SpellE">bilahan</span>,"
the portion covering her private parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant then inserted his penis into her organ through the openings in
her short pants and panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All this
time, complainant struggled to prevent the sexual assault but she became </span><span style="">too </span><span style="">weak to sufficiently resist appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the consummation of the dastardly deed, appellant told
complainant to go home, which she did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching their farmhouse, and on her mother's inquiry why she was
late in coming home, complainant forthwith told her mother about her
unfortunate experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking off her
clothes, complainant noticed that there were blood stains on the portion of her
panties covering her private parts and that her dress was soiled with mud at
the back portion, which items of apparel were presented and admitted as
evidence in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's mother asked a nephew to contact the barrio
captain, one <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Ponce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, upon being told of what happened,
then went to the place where appellant was staying and told appellant <span style="">that </span>he was to be delivered and
surrendered, as appellant was in fact surrendered to the municipal hall for
safekeeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, complainant
was investigated in writing by police authorities and was subjected to medical
examination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The medical certificate
issued by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gavina</span> V. </span><span class="SpellE">Galbines</span>,
who conducted the medical examination on complainant on <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1981</st1:date>, contained the following
findings:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">â€œPelvic examination:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>speculum examination:</span></p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Introitus</span>
- admits one finger easily, admits two fingers with less resistance, presence
of fresh <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> <span style="">laceration.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Cervix<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>- closed, no <span class="SpellE">cervicitis</span> noted, bloody discharges peering from the
cervical <span class="SpellE">os</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Uterus<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-</span>
not enlarged</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Adnexa</span> - negative</blockquote>

<blockquote>Discharges - bloody, non-odorous</blockquote>

<blockquote>N. B<span class="GramE">. :</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Patient is <span class="SpellE">menstrating</span>."
(<span class="GramE">sic</span>)<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant espouses a different version.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He admits having had sexual intercourse with the complainant but claims that
the coitus was mutually agreed upon by them, they being sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant moreover claims that the copulation
occurred in their house and not on the muddy trail as alleged by the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As proof of their
relationship, appellant presented as evidence a ring and a letter allegedly
given to him by the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
appellant faults the trial court in finding him guilty of the crime of rape by
using force or intimidation.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In amplification of his plaint, appellant assails the
prosecution's version as incredible and cites the fact that complainant did not
suffer any injury as proof that she never resisted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lack of an outcry from the complainant,
appellant insists, also negates complainant's story.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain appellant's conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Owing to the peculiar nature of the crime of rape, the very act
itself is oftentimes, as in this case, witnessed by only two people, the
complainant and the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
consequence, extreme care and caution is required in weighing and appraising
their conflicting testimonies to ensure that justice is meted out.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Proceeding from this premise, we have carefully perused
complainant's testimony and we find that the same was related with all
sincerity and candor expected of a girl truthfully recounting the terrible
experience which had befallen her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
straightforward account of the events which occurred before, during and after
the rape was consistent and unwavering even during the cross-examination,
obvious proof of the veracity of her declarations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue raised on the absence of any other injury on the victim
is of no moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the complainant
did not sustain any additional injury does not negate the fact of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant found no need to employ such force
as would have battered complainant because she had already submitted out of fear
and exhaustion <span style="">as she continued to free
herself from the clutches </span>of the appellant who poked a hunting knife on
her and threatened to kill her unless she kept quiet.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Firmly settled is the rule that rape may be committed even if the
force employed was not so great nor of such character as could not be resisted;
intimidation is sufficient, and this includes the moral kind such as the fear
caused by threatening a victim with a pistol or knife,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lack of an outcry on the part of the complainant likewise
does not render improbable the commission of rape against her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Human reactions vary and are
unpredictable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A person at one moment
may cry her heart out over her misfortune but may be dry-eyed the next time she
recalls her tragic fate.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, as earlier stated, the complainant was cowed into silence by the
menacing demeanor of appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, complainant's behavior immediately after the incident
adequately supports the credibility of her claim that she was raped by
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant lost no time in
reporting the outrage on her honor to her parents and, later to the police,
after which she submitted herself to physical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These actuations are certainly inconsistent <span style="">with appellant's allegation that he had a
romantic relationship with the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If, in fact, complainant was in love with him, she could have easily
forgiven him; she would not have submitted herself to physical examination of
her private parts; she would not have gone to the extent of filing this charge;
nor would she have allowed herself to undergo the ordeal and embarrassment of a
public trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Even granting <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>gratia</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>argumenti</u></span> that complainant and accused were
lovers, the latter nevertheless committed rape when he compelled her to yield
to his sex drive, physically overcame her spirited resistance and sexually took
her against her will.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Love is not
a license for lust, at least upon a sweetheart only <span class="GramE">who</span>,
unlike the wife, has a right to resist the passionate advances of her partner.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In any event, the
circumstances of force and </span>intimidation attending the present case are
manifested clearly not only by complainant's testimony but also by the physical
evidence presented during the trial consisting of <span style="">the torn pants and underwear of the complainant and the medico-legal
report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such evidence indeed <span class="GramE">are</span> more eloquent than a hundred witnesses.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It
is also evident that the version of appellant that he and the victim were
lovers is not </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">improbable but is
also full of contradictions, inconsistencies and equivocations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As categorically found and aptly observed by
the trial court regarding appellant's allegation that the copulation took place
in his aunt's house where he was staying -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court is not unmindful of the testimony of the accused <span style="">in </span>refutation of the testimony of the
complainant to the effect that the sexual attack took place on the â€˜human
trailâ€™ on her way to their farmhouse, when he said in effect that the sexual
intercourse was in a room in his house, but this becomes incredulous (sic) when
he further said (Ibid., pp. 22-23) that the house has only one room and there
were four persons inside the house at the time (his aunt Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pacion</span> and her 3 children), albeit his cousins were outside
(the <span style="">room).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even married couples would hesitate to
copulate under such environment! Furthermore, the testimony of the accused is
belied by the testimony of his own aunt and witness, Magdalena <span class="SpellE">Pacion</span>, when she said in effect that at the time of the
incident she was not there (at home) - t. s. n., <span class="SpellE">Salido</span>,
p. 12., test. <span class="GramE">of</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacion</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More telling are the perceptive findings of said court on the
ring and the letter presented by the defense as proof that appellant and
complainant were sweethearts, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the thrust of the defense of the accused
is to the effect that the sexual intercourse he had with complainant was
between sweethearts and not a punishable crime (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<span style="">test. <span class="GramE">of</span> <span class="SpellE">Murallon</span>, p. 4; test. <span class="GramE">of</span> <span class="SpellE">Pacion</span>, p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Salido</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As proof of this accused <span class="SpellE">Murallon</span>
said that complainant Montes gave him a ring, Exhibit '2' (Ibid., </span><span style="">p. </span><span style="">5) and in turn he gave her a ring similar to
Exhibit â€˜2', with the difference that the ring he gave has a reddish pearl on
top of it (Ibid., pp. 6-7); and in jail she visited him and gave him a letter,
Exhibit â€˜1'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And his aunt <span class="SpellE">Pacion</span> testified that â€˜I believe they (<span class="SpellE">Murallon</span>
and Montes) are sweethearts because there is even a letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
â€˜1' of <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span> to <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> (<span class="SpellE">Murallon</span>)' â€˜â€¦ shown to me by <span class="SpellE">Romy</span>.'
<span class="GramE">(Ibid., p. 7).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit '2' appears to be an ordinary iron or aluminum ring, which is
seldom peddled even by sidewalk vendors because it is almost worthless, or at
most, to the thinking of the Court, nobody would ordinarily buy for more than a
few pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">To the
thinking of the Court also, no sweetheart, even how poor, would give such kind
of a present to a loved one.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
complainant Montes was confronted with the ring in cross-examination, she said
that she had not seen it before and did not have a ring like it (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 7-8, <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter, Exhibit '1', is in <span class="SpellE">Cebuano-Visayan</span>, done on a notebook sheet, the translation
of which was not made by the defense despite its reservation to do so (Ibid.,
p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears to be written by one <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span> to <span class="SpellE">Romey</span> (sic) under
date of </span><st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="9"><span style="">September 9, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, but on cross-examination (Ibid., p. 28) the complainant said the letter
is not hers and she has no idea who wrote it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the cross-examination of the accused <span class="SpellE">Murallon</span>,
he said that Exhibit â€˜1' was given to him by <span class="SpellE">Carmencita</span>
on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="5" month="9"><span style="">September 5, 1984</span></st1:date><span style=""> (81?) - <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 12, <span class="SpellE">Salido</span>
- which puts the cart before the <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>, so to say,
because the letter would have been delivered before it was written.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted observations of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
