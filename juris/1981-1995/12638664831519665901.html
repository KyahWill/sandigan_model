her two thighs with his left elbow as well as ** the wrist of her right hand,

and middle finger on ** (her) cheeks ** in order that her mouth could be opened
and something which looked like coffee placed in a glass was poured into her
mouth, thus, she was able to drink the liquid which tasted sweet and bitter, **
after which she became dizzy and did not know anymore what happened to her as
she regained consciousness only at three o'clock dawn of the following morning
and found out that she was still in the bedroom with Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span>
lying beside her and was already awake; that when she woke up **, she cried

and she found out that she had nothing on any more except her <span class="SpellE"><i>sando</i></span> underwear; that in the previous evening before
the incident, she saw Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span> wearing an
undershirt and long pants, but when she woke up ** she saw that the accused was
not any more in his long pants, but only a brief 'Walker' and a sleeveless
undershirt; that she went out of the bedroom ** and went to the <span class="SpellE"><i>sala</i></span>, after which Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span>
also went out and proceeded to the (other) bedroom where Lolo <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span> was and woke (him) up ** because according to the
accused, they were already plying their bus, while she went back inside the
bedroom; that when she woke up that early morning, the first thing she noticed
when she sat near the feet of Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span> was her
panty with blood, which she put on and went out of the room; that during the
whole day of (that) Wednesday, she stayed in the house of Lolo <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span> with Mrs. Paz <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>
and went to ** (her) boarding house (at <span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span> City)
at 8:00 in the evening, where her elder sister was also boarding, but when she
arrived there, her sister was in the church and came back only at 8:30 when she
was already asleep; that when she felt the pain on her vagina, she became
worried and as she was schooling during that time, she did not any more go to
school after the incident because she was ashamed, so she went home (to Barrio <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>) **; and that when she examined the area on her body
which was hurting, she found out in her anus that there was something like
water, but was only sticky, which caused it to be wet."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (Lolo) <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>
testified that in the evening of February 20, 1973, he and his wife, Paz <span class="SpellE">Inot</span>, had indeed gone to the theater.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon their return to their home at around
10:30 o'clock, they came upon Loreto and <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>, who
were in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, dancing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lolo also asked Loreto, "What is this
all about?" Loreto said that they would just sleep there since it was
already curfew.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lola thereupon asked <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> who her parents were, and when <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
told him, he said that her father was his friend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asked <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
"if nothing worse will occur and ** (she) replied there is nothing."
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span> was insisting that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
should go home, but Lolo told <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> "that
since it was already curfew hour he will permit her to sleep in his house
provided the following morning she would go home." <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Turtogo</span> slept in the room with Lolo <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>, the latter's wife, and their small daughter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He himself then reported for
work, and when he returned to his home at about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, he
was told by his wife that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> had departed after

<p class="BODY">Some twelve (12) days after the promulgation of judgment, Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago's</span> attorney, <span class="SpellE">Heliodoro</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Fiel</span>, filed a motion for new trial on the ground of newly
discovered evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
consisted of a letter that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> had supposedly
asked one Cesar <span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span> to deliver to her
sweetheart, Loreto, reading:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>"Dear
<span class="SpellE">Noy</span> <span class="SpellE">Nito</span>,:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Noy</span>, bring my bag
tomorrow and leave it at the corner, and tell that it should be</i> <i>brought

affidavit was appended to the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">This move proved disastrous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For when Cesar <span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span> gave evidence at the
hearing of the motion for new trial, he denied material portions of his
affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That affidavit, according to
him, was prepared by Loreto's lawyer, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Fiel</span>, in
the latter's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He disclaimed that
part of the affidavit depicting <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> and Loreto as
lovers, although he admitted the portion referring to his intimate acquaintance
with <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also denied the allegation in his
affidavit that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> had given him a note for
delivery to Loreto, asserting that the note entrusted to him by <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> on February 20, 1973 was not for Loreto, but for <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> mother, which he had delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While admitting that he had gone to see
Loreto at the City Jail, he averred that it was for the purpose of paying for
some pigs and not, as his affidavit states, to deliver any note to him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the letter allegedly entrusted to Cesar <span class="SpellE">Maglasang</span>, marked as Exhibit "1," was discovered
by the Court, upon examination, to bear "earmarks of a simulation or
falsification with the addition of the word 'love' prior to '<span class="SpellE">Inday</span>,' because a comparison of Exhibit 'X' with the
handwritten word, 'love,' in ball pen and in pencil by the complainant clearly
reveal the difference in the writing of 'love' before <span class="SpellE">Inday</span>
in said Exhibit '1' and the word 'love' handwritten in open Court by the
complainant in Exhibit 'X.'"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant's motion for new trial was consequently denied by

Hence, the present appeal in which Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span>
pleads for reversal of the verdict of conviction and his acquittal on
reasonable doubt on the basis of two (2) errors attributed by him to the Court <i>a
quo</i>, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>finding
that he had carnal knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> "when
the People's own evidence positively shows the contrary," and</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>finding
that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> "was deprived of reason or was
rendered unconscious with the use of drugs applied by the accused in
cooperation and conspiracy with <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span> and Paz <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>, when
there are facts and circumstances in the <span class="SpellE">expediente</span>
making the testimony relative thereto ** incredible."</p>

<p class="BODY">In substantiation of the first ascribed error, the appellant
invokes the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span> <span class="SpellE">Kierulf</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Kierulf's</span> testimony is to the effect that -</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florita</span> was still a virgin at the time he examined her with
the use of a "vaginal speculum" six (6) days after the alleged rape;</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florita</span>, on examination, was found negative for
spermatozoa;</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>her
hymen was intact, not damaged, there being only a very slight laceration
thereof which however he did not believe could have been caused by the
insertion of some object into her vagina; indeed, the physician's finger could
not be inserted in that organ;</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:45.0pt">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if
was unlikely that that slight laceration was caused by penetration, of "a
hard object, for example a penis," because, as the physician put it,
"if you are also the man ** you do not have to stop there."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant argues that assuming that <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
had been rendered unconscious by some drug and made incapable of presenting any
resistance of any sort, there is no reason why the appellant would not have
actually entered her while she was in that utterly helpless state, if in truth,
what he intended was to have carnal knowledge of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact is, however, that she was
subsequently found to be still a virgin, with only a very slight laceration of
her hymen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This demonstrates, the appellant
submits, that her complaint of rape was "nothing but a fabricated
charge," "more fictional than factual."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also contends that <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span>
narrative of the things that transpired at the <span class="SpellE">Bonsilaos</span>'
residence taxes credulity, is so unnatural as to be totally undeserving of
credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must at the outset be conceded that the evidence given by
appellant Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span> is feeble, even
contrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the proofs of the
prosecution are of no better character, if not actually inferior.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The familiar principle that the prosecution
must rely for a conviction on the strength of its proofs, and not on the
weakness of those of the defense, is peculiarly applicable to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is self-contradictory to assert as the Trial Court has in
effect done, that rape was perpetrated on a girl who was found on expert
medical examination six (6) days later, to be a virgin, her hymen intact and
not damaged, there being only a very slight laceration thereof which however,
in the view of the forensic expert who examined her, could not have been caused
by the insertion of some object into her vagina, there having been "no
penetration because not even a finger could ** (enter) the vagina of <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> <span class="SpellE">Turtogo</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
No explanation of the paradox has been given by the Trial Court or is otherwise
furnished by the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> recital of the
manner by which she was sexually assaulted, and the events thereafter
transpiring do not inspire belief, being quite contrary to normal behavior and
experience.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <i>locus</i> of the crime could not be more
inauspicious:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a small two-bedroom house,
then occupied by a married couple not shown to be otherwise than respectable,
and "many teen-agers and children."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the co-conspirators of the rapist could not be a more
unlikely pair:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the owners of the house
in which <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> defloration had taken place:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a married woman, who had come to know <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> only at that time, and her husband, Lolo <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>, who knew <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> only
slightly, both described as having spontaneously consented to the commission of
a sexual assault in their own home, in which their own children, and their
nephews and nieces were then sleeping.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> own conduct subsequent to her
violation could not be more improbable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she recovered consciousness and discovered that she had been
deflowered, she felt no anger, or panic, or other strong emotion; she did not
confront the <span class="SpellE">Bonsilaos</span> or Loreto and denounce them,
or attempt to flee that place of horror or otherwise seek assistance and
vindication; she merely put on her panties though bloodied, and then, when
Loreto went out to work in the early morning, simply returned to the bedroom
and went back to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is more,
she stayed in the house the whole day following the night of her rape, again
neither confronting and remonstrating with the <span class="SpellE">Bonsilaos</span>
nor trying to leave and complain to the authorities against them and Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She even
took a long <i>siesta</i> and was in fact still slumbering when Loreto returned
to the house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On waking up, she had a
brief conversation with her ravisher, Loreto, in the <span class="SpellE"><i>sala</i></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She left the <span class="SpellE">Bonsilaos</span>'
home only at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8 o'clock</st1:time> at night,
went to her boarding house and, when she discovered no one there, again went to
sleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her subsequent acts were also most commonplace:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>she went to Can-<span class="SpellE">adieng</span>
to "collect money," apparently on earlier instructions of her mother,
then went home and gave the money to her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No effort was made to report her ravishment
to her parents, to her sisters, or to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, instead of denouncing Loreto <span class="SpellE">Malbago</span>, she wrote a note to him three (3) days later and
had it delivered by a friend, asking him to do her a small favor, to give her
bag to "<span class="SpellE">Mana</span> Aurora." She obviously had no
intention of making known her alleged defilement to any one had not Lolo <span class="SpellE">Bonsilao</span>, according to her, gossiped to the passengers of
his bus about "what happened to her," and one of the latter had told
her father about it; and even then, she said she would still have to think
about filing a case against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">So often has it been said almost to the point of triteness that
evidence to be believed must not only proceed from a credible witness, but must
be credible in itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here we have an
extremely incredible story, of the defloration of a girl who has yet retained
her virginity, and who afterwards, instead of manifesting that great anger that
might be expected of a maiden so grievously wronged, did nothing but the most
pedestrian things, even requesting her supposed defiler to do an errand for
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not difficult to reconstruct what really happened:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> parents
were unwilling to accept her declaration that nothing had happened between her
and Loreto, and that she had gone with him to the <span class="SpellE">Bonsilaos</span>
simply out of pique resulting from her elder sister's scolding, and because of
the prospect of obtaining a job at another place; her parents were clearly of
the impression that the story would not be believed by their relatives and
friends, and would bring disgrace to <span class="SpellE">Florita</span> and her
family; hence, the ideation of a new version of the incident, to protect <span class="SpellE">Florita's</span> honor, which was the version recounted to the
investigators and eventually the Trial Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The stratagem was helped along by the bungling of Loreto and his counsel
who, instead of standing by the truth, made what the Trial Court perceived to
be a clumsy attempt to embellish an innocuous note of <span class="SpellE">Florita</span>
to Loreto and make it appear as a communication between lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be this as it may, the Court cannot affirm a
conviction of such a grave crime as rape on the basis of a demonstrably
unnatural and unpersuasive narration of facts by the complaining witness.</p>
