Commission (CSC) to pass upon contested appointments is brought into focus in
this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appearance of the

<p class="BODY">In the course of the reorganization of the Department of
Transportation and Communications (DOTC), Guido C. <span class="SpellE">Agon</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
who was also appointed to the position of Supervising Telecommunications
Engineer, range 12, questioned the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span>

Reorganization Appeals Board of the DOTC composed of <span class="SpellE">Moises</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, Jr. of the Office of the Secretary, as
Chairman and Assistant Secretary <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Sitchon</span> of the Office of the Secretary, as members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1989</st1:date> the said Reorganization Appeals

respondent Civil Service Commission (CSC).</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="8">August
 29, 1989</st1:date>, respondent CSC revoked the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span> for the

DOTC Assistant Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> sought a

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="12">December

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>
filed their separate motions for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
resolutions of the CSC but these were denied by the said commission in a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for a writ
of preliminary injunction or restraining order which was filed by the Solicitor
General in behalf of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1990</st1:date>, the Court required
the respondents to comment on the petition within ten (10) days from notice and
issued a restraining order enjoining the CSC from enforcing its questioned
resolutions until further orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this case is whether or not the CSC acted in
excess of its jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
of jurisdiction when it ordered the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Nerio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> to the contested position.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Whil</span>e<span style=""> </span>petitioner does not question the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> resolu<span style="">t</span>ions
of the CSC insofar as it disapproved the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span>
<span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>
to the positions of Head Telecommunications Engineer, petitioner maintains that
as the appointing authority, <span style="">he </span>has
the right of choice and discretion to appoint the persons whom he deems<span style=""> fit</span> to the position to be filled.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner emphasizes that when the CSC denied his motion for reconsideration
in re<span style="">sol</span>ution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1989</st1:date>, As<span style="">sist</span>ant Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span>
informed the CSC through a manifestation that the DOTC Selection and Promotions<span style=""> </span>Board will be convened to del<span style="">iber</span>ate<span style=""> </span>on the <span style="">position </span>of

the contested position.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the othe<span style="">r</span> <span style="">h</span>and, the CSC contends that it was

and legal duty<span style=""> to </span>enforce the
merit and fitness principle in the appointment of civil servants <span style="">an</span>d to uphold their equally g<span style="">uaranteed </span>right to be appointed <span style="">to </span>similar or comparable positions in

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and Section 12 of the same Executive
Order:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 12. - The Commission <u>shall administer the Civil
Service</u> and shall have the following powers and functions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) <u>Administer and enforce the constitutional and statutory
provision of the said merit systems</u>..."(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">respondent CSC argues that the primary
objective of the CSC system is to promote and establish professionalism by
ensuring a high level of morale among the employees and officers in the career
civil service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to this
constitutional mandate, the CSC contends it should see to it that the merit system
is applied, enforced and implemented in personnel actions involving
appointments affecting all levels and ranks in the civil service at all times.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

known as the "Civil Service Decree of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,"

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing provision it is clear that the CSC has the
power to <u>approve</u> or <u>disapprove</u><span style=""> </span><span style="">an </span>appointment and
not the power to make the appointment itself or to direct that such appointment
be made by the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
CSC can only inquire into the eligibility of the person chosen to fill a vacant
position and if it finds the person qualified it must so attest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The duty of the CSC is to attest
appointments.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

its participation in the appointment process ceases.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, should the <span style="">CSC </span>find that the appointee is not qualified for the position, it
has the duty to disapprove the appointment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the responsibility of appointing the qualified person in
lieu of the disqualified appointee rests upon the discretion of the appointing
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC cannot encroach upon
such discretion vested solely in the appointing authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has pronounced in no uncertain terms that the CSC has
no authority to revoke an appointment on the ground that another person is more
qualified for a particular position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court likewise held that the CSC does not have the authority to direct the
appointment of a substitute of its choice.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner demonstrated his deference to the resolutions of the
CSC disapproving the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
in the implementation of said resolutions he decided to convene the DOTC
Selection and Promotions Board to deliberate on the person who should be appointed
as Head Telecommunications Engineer among qualified candidates including
respondent <span class="SpellE">Nerio</span> <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of acknowledging the authority of
petitioner to exercise its discretion in the appointment of a replacement, the
CSC, in excess of its jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction, directed the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>
as the substitute of its choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
act of the CSC must be struck down. </p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span>, besides
his comment, filed a motion to disqualify the Office of the Solicitor General
from appearing for petitioner and to cite petitioner in contempt of court for
the filing of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General is the lawyer of the government, its
agencies and instrumentalities, and its officials or agents including
petitioner and public respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
is so provided under Presidential Decree No. 478:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1. <u><span style="">Functions
</span>and Organization</u>.- (1) The Office of the Solicitor General shall
represent the Government of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
its agencies and instrumentalities and its officials and agents <u>in any
litigation, proceeding, investigation or matter requiring the services of a
lawyer</u>. xxx." (Emphasis supplied.)<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10-A</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the discharge of this task the Solicitor General must see to
it that the best interest of the government is upheld within the limits <span style="">set </span>by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with a situation where one
government office takes an adverse position against another government agency,
as in this case, the Solicitor General should not refrain from performing his
duty as the lawyer of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is incumbent upon him to present to the court what he considers would legally
uphold the best interest of the government although it may run counter to a client's
position.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> In such an instance the
government office adversely affected by the position taken by the Solicitor
General, if it still believes in the merit of its case, may appear in its own
behalf through its legal personnel or representative.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>the present
case, it appears that after the Solicitor General studied the issues he found
merit in the cause of the petitioner based on the applicable law and
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is his duty to
represent the petitioner as he did by filing this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cannot be disqualified from appearing for
the petitioner even if in so doing his representation runs against the
interests of the CSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the first time that the Office of the Solicitor
General has taken a position adverse to his clients like the CSC, the National
Labor Relations <span style="">Commission, among
others, and even the People of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
such instances, the Solicitor General nevertheless manifests his opinion and
recommendation to the Court which is an invaluable aid in the disposition of
the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On some occasions he begs
leave to be excused from intervening in the case, more so, when the client had
already filed its own comment different from the stand of the Solicitor General
or in a situation when he finds the contention of a private party tenable as
against that of the government or any of its agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General has recommended the
acquittal of the accused in appealed criminal cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are cases where a government agency declines the services
of the Solicitor General or otherwise fails or refuses to forward the papers of
the case to him for appropriate action.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court finds and so holds that this practice should be stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the Solicitor General is the
lawyer of the government, any of its agents and officials <span style="">in </span>any litigation, proceeding,
investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception is when such officials or
agents are being charged criminally or are being civilly sued for damages
arising from a felony.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> His
services cannot be lightly rejected, much less ignored by the office or
officials concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the assistance of the Solicitor General should be
welcomed by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be
given full support and cooperation by any agency or official involved in
litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be enabled to faithfully
discharge his duties and responsibilities as the government advocate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And he should do no less for his
clients.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His burden assisting in the
fair and just administration of justice is clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court does not expect the Solicitor General to waver in the
performance of his duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, the Court appreciates the participation of the Solicitor General in many
proceedings and his continued fealty to his assigned task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not therefore desist from appearing
before this Court even in those cases he finds his opinion inconsistent with
the government or any of its agents he is expected to represent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court must be advised of his position
just as well.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> also seeks to hold petitioner in contempt of court
on the ground that the petition was filed in order to circumvent or obviate the
dismissal of a similar petition in this Court filed by Guido <span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal personality of the petitioner to
file the petition is also questioned on the ground it was Assistant Secretary <span class="SpellE">Sibal</span> and not the petitioner who issued the contested
appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner denies this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asserts that the petition was properly
brought in his name as head of the DOTC as what is in issue is the reorganization
of the said department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
does not dispute the disapproval of the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>; he only disagrees with the order of the
CSC directing the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> to the
contested position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner also alleges
that he was not aware of the existence of a separate petition filed in this
Court by <span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
arguments and assertions of petitioner to be well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the records of this Court show that there is such
a case docketed as G.R. No. 92064 entitled "Guido <span class="SpellE">Agon</span>,
et al., vs. CSC, et al." which is a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
with a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was dismissed for late filing in
a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1990</st1:date>
this Court denied with finality the motion for reconsideration filed by the
said petitioners there being no compelling reason to warrant the reversal of
the questioned resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the disapproval of the appointments of <span class="SpellE">Agon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Magnayon</span> was the issue
in said petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present
petition as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, petitioner yields to the
disapproval of the appointment of the two, but questions the authority of the
CSC to direct the appointment of <span class="SpellE">Madarang</span> to the
contested position.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the questioned
resolutions of the respondent CSC dated <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="8">August
