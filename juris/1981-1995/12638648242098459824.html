				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of
Quezon City, Branch 106, finding appellant Juan P. David guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of five counts of rape sentencing him for each count to suffer
the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay indemnity of P30,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Criminal Case No. Q-20893, the complaint reads:</p>

of the complainant LUZ DELGADO, against her will." (Rollo, p. 27)<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence upon which the trial court based its
finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is summarized as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that in late 1978, the accused Juan David met
Adelaida Masupil (maternal aunt of the private complainant Ma. Theresa
Aguilar).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They both worked in the office
of an architect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun was a married
man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Adelaida did not know
this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, when she testified,
the court observed that Adelaida is naive and impressionable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Six months after they were acquainted, Jun became Adelaida's
boyfriend.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Valentine's day, 1979
they eloped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the elopement, Jun
confessed that he was a married man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was angry, but he was able to mollify her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They went to live at the house of Jun's mother in Bacolor,
Pampanga.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They lived there for about a
year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In December 1980, Adelaida's sister, Toribia Aguilar, invited
them to live in her house at 35 Scout Castor Street, Toribia was going on
business to Japan and Korea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted
her sister to take care of the children while their mother was abroad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They accepted the invitation and moved in.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After they transferred to Toribia's house, Jun worked as a
draftsman for another architect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mainly,
he did his work at home, particularly in his second floor bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here, he kept his tools and implements,
including a long knife to cut paper with (Exhibits "F" and
"16").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Adelaida said she
frequently saw him cutting drafting paper, (Exhibit "V").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He usually reported to office only on a
Friday or Saturday.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Adelaida stayed at home with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She kept an eye on the children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But eventually, they were able to hire a
trustworthy babysitter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, in March
1982, Adelaida accepted employment in the office of her sister Toribia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This office was opened only the month
before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Toribia was engaged in
entertainment promotions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically,
they took prospective Japanese employers on a survey of Manila nightclub
entertainers and hired some of them for entertainment work in Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes the sisters worked until late at
night, because of the nature of the job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Initially, Adelaida's family were lukewarm to Jun because
they knew he was a married man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But for
Adelaida's sake, they learned to accept the relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two couples lived harmoniously in the
Aguilars house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Toribia said that he
treated Jun as a brother and trusted him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She felt secure when she was abroad, because he and Adelaida were at
home to take care of the children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
first, he was very kind to the children and always brought something home for
them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But gradually, Adelaida noted that Jun's attitude changed,
particularly with respect to Theresa.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adelaida said that for about three times, she saw Jun touch Theresa's
vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'Pinipisil-pisil niya na parang
nanggigigil’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, Theresa was
about four years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she saw the
incident for the first time, Adelaida chose to ignore it, but suspicion raced
in her mind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second time, she advised Theresa that if Jun did the act again,
Theresa must tell Jun to stop, because Theresa's father would get angry if he
knew.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, Adelaida accosted Jun
himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denied that she saw anything
immoral, and claimed that he was merely playing with the children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Further, Adelaida testified that Jun used to engage in
playful banter with the maid Luz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
latter would sometimes cry out to Adelaida: 'Ate Dea, eto si Jun, o.' The tone
of Luz's voice also aroused Adelaida's suspicion, but she kept it to herself
because she did not actually see Jun doing anything to Luz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One time, when Adelaida was working on a temporary basis, she
went home at 7:30 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw Jun and
Theresa watching TV with the lights off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adelaida was surprised and asked why the lights were off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun said that there was a brownout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This could not have been true, because the TV
was on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun and the child Theresa were
sitting side by side on the sofa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz said that Jun had a mean streak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the children misbehaved, he maltreated
them and denied them lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Luz was
afraid to precipitate a quarrel between the parents and Jun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, Luz was afraid Toribia might think she
was not taking good care of the children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz believed that when Jun threatened to kill the children,
he was perfectly capable of doing so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jun usually went around the house wearing only a pair of
short pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He put on a shirt only at
mealtime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the household, Luz was not treated as an ordinary
maid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her deceased mother used to work
as a temporary maid of the Aguilar family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When her mother reported to the Aguilar household, Luz tagged
along.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mother died in 1 January
1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She entrusted Luz to the care of
the Aguilar couple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz moved in with
the couple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She left for a short while,
but when Toribia returned from abroad, Luz also returned to the household,
toward the end of 1981.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Aguilar couple treated Luz like a member of the
family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She assumed various household
duties, including babysitting the three girls.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz testified that Jun raped her four times in the summer of
1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first time took place at about
the first week of April, at about 2:00 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only the children were at home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The man of the house, Antonio Aguilar, was in Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is a professional singer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jun shouted for her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She went up to his bedroom on the second floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was sending her on an
errand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But when she reached the room,
Jun locked the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He showed her
photos of naked women which he took out from a plastic bag with the logo of
National Bookstore.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jun forced her to read the literature that occupied the
pornographic photos, but she refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
spread out the photos on the bed and once more, forced her to read.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She continued to refuse and tried to leave
the room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jun grew angry and forced her to lie down on the bed by
holding her on both arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With his left
hand, he pinned her two arms down on the bed beyond her head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With his right hand, he held a knife about 8
inches long and threatened to kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He kissed her on the face and put the knife down on the floor, maybe
about two meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is not sure
of the distance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz was wearing a blouse and skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun placed his right hand inside her
skirt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He touched her two breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He forcibly removed her panty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Jun released her, stood up and removed his shorts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried to run away, but he boxed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He lowered himself on top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because he was stronger, he was able to force
his sex organ inside hers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt
pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He moved on top of her for sometime,
maybe for an hour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz felt that her vagina was bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She passed her hand on her buttocks and saw
blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She tried to remove his penis
because she was in pain, but he pumped faster.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After this first incident, she confided what happened to the
houseboy Danilo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was not until
after the fourth incident that Danilo in turn told Toribia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz did not complain to Toribia, because Luz
was afraid that Jun would carry out his threat to kill her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Toribia noticed that she had been crying, and asked her
why.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She answered that she had a
headache.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was because Jun was
present and staring her down.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, Luz believed that even if she told Toribia, the
latter would not believe her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz
thought that in a confrontation, the family would instead take Jun's version to
be true because after all, he was Adelaida’s husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Luz believed the death threat because Jun customarily went
around the house holding the knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, this did not strike the rest of the household as unusual,
because they knew he used the knife to cut paper with.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When she was with other members of the household, Jun would
always stare her down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was able to
intimidate her this way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz described
Jun's demeanor in Tagalog as '<u>nanlilisik</u> <u>ang</u> <u>mata</u>'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second rape, took place about the second week of April,
at about 4:00 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the children
were at home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz was fixing clothes in
the maid's room on the ground floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, Jun entered the room and asked what she was doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She demanded to know what brought him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He replied that he just wanted to see what
was going on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asked him to leave.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Instead of leaving, he locked the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She threatened to scream.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If she did, Jun said, he would kill all the
children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he was not then
holding the knife, Luz felt afraid and believed his threat.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He ordered her to stand up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He held her and laid her down on the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He prevented her from getting up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She resisted but to no avail, because he was
stronger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He placed his hand across her
mouth to prevent her from shouting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
did not occur to her to bite his hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He raped her for the second time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After he finished, he repeated his threat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If she reported what happened, he would kill
Toribia and the children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She did not report this incident because she was ashamed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The third rape took place at about the third week of May in
the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the children were in
the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both Luz and Jun were
downstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He ordered her to fetch a
drawing from his upstairs bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
hesitated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shouted at her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, she went up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unknown to her, he followed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He locked the door and forced himself on her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He picked up the knife that was lying on his table.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He forced her down on the bed and forcibly
penetrated her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz recounted that for
about half an hour, he moved on top of her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, he ejaculated a white sticky substance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he was finished, he stood up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He warned her not to tell anybody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The fourth rape took place at about the fourth week of May,
at about 11:00 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was in the
children's bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The four children
were sleeping in their bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
keeping them company and was sleeping in a separate bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bedroom door was locked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Apparently, Jun entered the bedroom by passing thru the
adjoining bathroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He lay down beside
her and started kissing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
awoke.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He placed his hand across her
mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He brandished the knife and
warned her not to make a sound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He lay
on top of her for about half an hour.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She fought back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although she was afraid because of the knife, she pushed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two of them fell on the bed, but none of
the children awoke.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He raped her for the
fourth time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After he left, she did not wake up the children because she
wanted to shield them from knowledge of such an ugly thing. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>She was unable to sleep for the rest of the
night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She did not notice when Toribia and her husband arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw Toribia the next morning, but she did
not report the matter because she was afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She was in turmoil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She decided to report what happened to Toribia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But she had to wait for the proper time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She missed her menstruation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, she learned that Theresa reported to
her mother that Jun had molested the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This emboldened her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime in May, Theresa who was six years old was playing
downstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun called her from his
second floor bedroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, she dutifully
complied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she entered the room, he
did not say anything.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He made her lie
down and took off her panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He took off
his shorts and briefs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw that his
penis was exposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He put his penis on
her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Theresa felt pain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The second rape also took place in Jun's room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her sister Aurea, 5, was in the same
room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jun ordered them both to go to
sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She saw that Aurea was very
sleepy and instantly obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also
closed her eyes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He took off her skirt and panty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he took off his shorts and briefs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He inserted his finger inside her
vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both acts produced pain for
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not shout because if she
did, then, Jun would know that she was not sleeping.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"Her parents arrived,
maybe at 9:00 p.m.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not tell them
what happened, because Jun was at home and she was afraid of him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On 30 May 1982, a Sunday, Jun and Adelaida went out to
church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Theresa told her mother what
happened.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Adelaida and Jun went to Pampanga to fetch some of Adelaida's
things.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They did not return right
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The family speculated that Jun
forced Adelaida to stay with him in Pampanga.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe he was holding her hostage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While the family discussed this speculation, Toribia noticed
that Luz was all ears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Toribia felt that
Luz should not be privy to such a private discussion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, Toribia ordered Luz to go upstairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Luz did not obey and remained where she
was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Toribia got angry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, Luz burst into tears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was when Luz revealed that Jun raped
her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When Adelaida and Jun returned home, they found the household
strangely quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They told Adelaida that
they had learned that Jun had raped Theresa and Luz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Adelaida asked Jun to leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He cried while he packed, and left that same
night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Theresa's
disclosure, Toribia immediately informed her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He called a lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the lawyer's suggestion, they brought
Theresa to the Capitol Medical Center.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They told the doctor that their daughter was complaining of itchiness in
the vagina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, as the doctor was conducting the examination, they
decided to reveal that their daughter had actually complained that she had been
raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearing this, the doctor
refused to give a medical certificate and suggested that they should go to Camp
Crame or to the NBI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Toribia hesitated
to take the doctor's advise, because she was afraid that a medical examination
would traumatize her daughter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On 1 July 1981 (should be 1982), Toribia took the two girls
to the PC crime laboratory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The medico
legal officer issued Luz' clinical history report (Exhibit "J").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also made a clinical history report on
Theresa (Exhibit "H").</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The chief of the PC-CIS sent a letter-request to the head of the
crime laboratory for medical examination (Exhibit "G”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lt. Col. Gregorio Blanco conducted an
examination on Theresa and submitted his medico legal report (Exh.
"I").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The report states that
he found no external signs of recent application of any form of trauma.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The smears were negative for
spermatozoa.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found that physically,
Therese was still a virgin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But he found the vulvar area to be congested and
reddish.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This condition may have been
caused by an attempt to forcibly insert the penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The penis may have penetrated the <u>labia</u>
<u>majora</u> and <u>labia</u> <u>menora</u>, but not the hymen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Col. Blanco also examined Luz and filed his medico-legal report
(Exhibit "K").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no
external signs of recent application of any form of trauma.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found healed lacerations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The smears were negative for
spermatozoa.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He found that physically,
Luz was no longer a virgin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The lacerations indicated that there was more than one act of
sexual intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the
lacerations were healed, the intercourse could have taken place two months
before the examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If so, this
explains why there are no contusions or trauma.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On 2 July 1982, Toribia took the two girls to the
PC-CIS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Investigator Vicente took the
statements of Luz (Exhibit "E"); Theresa (Exhibit N"); and
Toribia (Exhibit “O”.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because of the trauma of the rapes, Theresa failed to pass
Grade I and had to repeat it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Previously, she passed nursery, preparatory, and kindergarden without
repeating any of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Theresa is also
bound to repeat Grade 2." (Rollo, pp. 28-35)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's defense consists of denials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He states that he did not rape either of the
two complainants at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According
to David, the Aguilar family trumped up the charges because the members wanted
to keep him away from Adelaida.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
attributes the physician's findings on the housemaid to her having an affair
with a houseboy named Danilo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to
Theresa's testimony against him, the appellant attributes it to a hyperactive
imagination caused by watching pornographic movies shown on television.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He states that this may have excited
Theresa's imagination to such an extent that the small girl fantasized
copulation with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In lieu of an assignment of errors, the appellant presents three
arguments:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>PROSECUTION’S EVIDENCE IS FATALLY FLAWED
AND HAS FAILED TO PROVE BEYOND REASONABLE GROUND THE GUILT OF ACCUSED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>CONDUCT OF COMPLAINANTS AFTER ALLEGED RAPE
CASTS DOUBTS ON THE TRUTH OF THE ALLEGATIONS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III<span style="font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IS CLEARLY
INSUFFICIENT TO CONVICT ACCUSED OF THE CHARGE OF THE RAPE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Appellant's Brief, pp. 5, 18, 20)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the testimony and evidence presented,
upon which the trial court based its decision, is clearly insufficient to find
him guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds, based on the records, that the elements of rape
were present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 335 of the Revised
Penal Code defines the crime of rape and provides for its penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The elements of rape pertinent to the case of
Luz Delgado are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) that the offender
had carnal knowledge of a woman, and 2) that such act is accomplished by using
force or intimidation (People v. Sunpongco, 163 SCRA 222, 230) and those
pertinent to the case of Theresa Aguilar are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of a woman, and 2) that such
act is committed when the woman is under twelve years of age.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also alleges that there was no showing that force
and intimidation were present as to the four rapes committed against Luz
Delgado.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not well-founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Luz Delgado's testimony, she stated that she was threatened
with a knife by the accused and there were threats to kill her if she would
attempt to shout and put up a resistance. </p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the lower court in its ruling that Luz Delgado's
testimony had passed the test of credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It ruled:</p>

<blockquote>This trial court was convinced by the sincere demeanor of the
private complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time she
testified, Luz was 17 and a factory worker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although she is a graduate of the Ramon Magsaysay High School, she did not
appear to be particularly intelligent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She cried intermittently while struggling to testify."</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both complainants hesitated for long stretches in answering
questions, particularly those concerning the actual violation; and they would
weep bitterly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Crying instead of
answering, when asked by the authorities, is not a denial of the rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She must have been ashamed that she has been
the victim of such a heinous offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All that she could do was cry when she was pointedly asked questions. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>People v. Prado 108 Phil. 716.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the rape victim cries while testifying,
this is evidence of credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>People
v. Syquioco, 118 SCRA 413." (Rollo, p. 38) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Also, in the case of <u>People</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Esquillo</u>, (G. R. No. 71311, March 31, 1989) we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"This Court has consistently held that the testimony of a rape
victim as to who abused her is credible where she has no motive to testify
against the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Luz Delgado has no motive in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court finds it quite improbable that a
naive inexperienced 16 year old domestic helper would fabricate matters and
thereby undergo the travails of a public trial exposing herself to humiliation
and embarassment by unraveling nasty matters against her virginity by lodging
against the appellant so grave and serious a charge, if not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Nunag, etc., GR No. 54445, May 12,
1989)</p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistency of Luz' testimony as to the dates of the rapes
is understandable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A rape victim is not
expected to keep an accurate account of the traumatic and horrifying experience
she went through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
trial court that these discrepancies are insignificant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was held in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Pacnis</u>
(G. R. No. 68992, September 26, 1988):</p>

<blockquote>"This court has time and again held that inconsistencies and
contradictions referring to minor details do not destroy the credibility of the
witness."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The approximate dates given by the victim do not indicate that
she was fabricating a story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
examination of her testimony indicates that the trial court did not err in
believing her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Luz Delgado's failure to immediately report the sexual abuse is
justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on her testimony, it
can be concluded that fear for her life was the cause of the delay:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had every reason to be afraid and
believed that the accused would carry out his threat as she and the children
were left most of the time alone with the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Galang, G. R. No. 70713, June
29, 1989)</p>

<p class="BODY">Failure to report an incident immediately does not cast doubt on
the credibility of the charge when delay is attributable to threats of death
given by the accused to the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant alleges that there was no carnal knowledge as
regards the rape of Theresa Aguilar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Theresa Aguilar's testimony positively identified accused as her
molester.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's allegation
that Theresa Aguilar's testimony was coached is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The young victim's failure to give a detailed
account of how she was abused, her denial that she conferred with a lawyer and
her admission that she did not shout nor cry are hardly consequential as to
negate the commission of the statutory crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of Theresa shows the naivete
and sincerity of childhood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she did
not cry is explained by the fact that the appellant was not able to penetrate
the hymen of the small girl.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the medical certificate states that the vulvar area is
congested and reddish and could have been caused by an attempt to forcibly
insert the penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges
that these were self-inflicted as Theresa Aguilar was exposed to pornographic
movies and TV shows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court agrees
with the trial court when it ruled:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Existing laws effectively
prohibit exhibition of pornography on television.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused did not specify what television
program showed the pornography, or what betamax tape did so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming arguendo that the child was so
exposed, it hardly seems psychologically plausible that a 6-year old girl will
masturbate, in the absence of other stimulation." (Rollo, p. 39)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant believes that as the doctor was informed beforehand
about the rapes committed, he was biased in preparing the medical certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical certificate contained facts based on medical
findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The findings that there were
lacerations and reddish and congested areas in the vulvar area in Luz Delgado
and Theresa Aguilar respectively were based on the physical examination of the
two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No amount of bias could have
changed those facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the appellant that the charges against him were
trumped up as the family of Adelaida did not like him is likewise, without
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is inconceivable that a mother of a six-year old child would
fabricate a rape charge, subject her daughter to physical examination and the
embarassment of a public trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A mother
would not sacrifice her daughter's honor to give vent to a grudge knowing fully
well that such an experience would certainly damage her daughter's psyche and
tar her for life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Pelias
Jones, 137 SCRA 166, 178 [1985]) She would have found other ways of going after
the appellant, if the latter's arguments were true.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the family of Adelaida had learned to accept the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This can be gleaned from the
fact that the sister of Adelaida invited both of them to live with the family
to take care of the children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This does
not show mere acceptance but trust as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant questions the absence of knowledge or earlier
discovery of the rapes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He describes the
lay-out-of the compact rooms and the partitions of the place wherein the rapes
allegedly occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
contends that it is impossible for other persons in the house not to have known
of any attempt of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of witnesses in rape cases is not unusual as the
offended party, more often than not, is the only one available to prove the
commission of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rape is
usually done with the least possibility of being seen by the public.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Masongsong, G. R. No. 63609, June
6, 1989.)</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the records and considering all the appellant's
arguments, we reiterate the rule so firmly settled that the findings of fact of
the trial court which had the inestimable advantage of listening to and
watching the witnesses as they appeared before the court, are entitled to the
greatest respect and will not be overturned by an appellate court save upon the
clearest evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People V.
Villaflores, G. R. No. 66039, June 8, 1989)</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>accused that<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the
consolidation of the five (5) separate criminal cases for rape had placed him
in an unenviable and veritably inequitable position as each case exists
separate from another because they involve entirely different circumstances and
two different sets of complainants, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 119, Sec. 14 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC 14.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consolidation
of trials of related offenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Charges
for offenses founded on the same facts, or forming part of a series of offenses
of similar character may be tried jointly at the court's discretion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This rule was applied in <u>Palanca</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Querubin</u>,
November 29, 1969, 36 SCRA 738, 745 where this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x where the offenses charged are similar, related, or
connected, or are of the same or similar character or class, or involve or
arose out of the same or related or connected acts, occurrences, transactions,
series of events, or chain of circumstances, or are based on acts or
transactions constituting parts of a common scheme or plan, or are of the same
pattern and committed in the same manner, or where there is a common element of
substantial importance in their commission, or where the same, or much the
same, evidence will be competent and admissible or required in their
prosecution, and if not joined for trial the repetition or reproduction of
substantially the same testimony will be required on each trial." (23 C.J.S.
pp. 680-681, citing cases.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No substantial right was affected as the accused was afforded
every opportunity to cross-examine and to secure the attendance of his
witnesses and produce evidence in his behalf.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the rapes were committed in substantially the same manner over
the same period of time, we believe that the trial court acted in accordance
with law and jurisprudence and in the interest of economy and speed in the
consolidation of these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the
appealed judgment finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt is hereby
AFFIRMED.</p>
