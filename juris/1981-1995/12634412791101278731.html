Mayor of the City of Cebu seeks nullification of:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(a) the Decision of
respondent Commission on Audit (No. 1364, dated June 15, 1990) DISALLOWING the
amount of P30,000.00  appropriated by
the City of Cebu relative to a compromise agreement entered into in Civil Case
No. 4275 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (Branch 23) -- an action
brought by the Spouses Benjamin and Evangeline de la Cerna against the City and
others -- which compromise was in due course embodied in a judgment of the
Court rendered on August 1, 1989; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(b) said
Commission's Decision (No. 2773, dated March 30, 1993) "denying due
course" to the city's motion for reconsideration of its Decision No. 1364
above mentioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy had its origin in the stabbing by an unknown
assailant of Reynaldo de la Cerna, the son of the aforementioned de la Cerna
Spouses, in the afternoon of September 6, 1985.  He was rushed to the Cebu City Medical Center, but unfortunately
expired in the evening of that same day due to severe loss of blood.  His parents claimed that Reynaldo would not
have died were it not for the "ineptitude, gross negligence,
irresponsibility, stupidity and incompetence of the medical staff” of the
Medical Center.</p>

<p class="BODY">The de la Cerna Spouses accordingly instituted in the Regional
Trial Court of Cebu City the above mentioned civil action, for recovery of
damages, based on paragraph 5, Article 2180 of the Civil Code.  Named defendants were the City of Cebu, the <i>Sangguniang
Panlungsod,</i> and five physicians of the Cebu City Medical Center.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The City of Cebu which, according to the complaint, "operates, maintains,
and manages the Cebu City Medical Center," was impleaded as defendant on
the theory that as employer of the alleged negligent doctors, it was
vicariously responsible for the latter's negligence since it failed to exercise
due care and vigilance over the doctors while acting within the scope of their
assigned tasks, to prevent them from causing the death of Reynaldo.  The Civil Code provision relied upon by
plaintiffs, pertinently reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2180.  The
obligation imposed by Article 2176 is demandable not only for one's own acts or
omissions, but also for those persons for whom one is responsible.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their employees
and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even
though the former are not engaged in any business or industry.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 12pt;">**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>**
”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the action had been pending for some time, negotiations for
an amicable settlement were commenced, which culminated in an agreement
designed to put an end to the controversy in a manner acceptable to the
parties.  Since the compromise agreement
included a provision for the payment of the sum of P30,000.00 to the plaintiffs
by defendant City of Cebu, the agreement was submitted to the <i>Sangguniang
Panlungsod </i>of the City, which ratified it on July 31, 1989.  The <i>sanggunian </i>authorized "the
City Budget Officer, Cebu City, to include in Supplemental Budget No. IV of the
City ** for the year 1989 the amount of THIRTY THOUSAND (P30,000.00) PESOS <i>for
financial assistance to the parents of the late Reynaldo de la Cerna, all of
Cebu City</i>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The agreement was also submitted to the Regional Trial Court which, on August
1, 1989, rendered a judgment "(f)inding the same to be in conformity with
law, morals and public policy" and enjoining the parties "to comply
strictly with the terms and conditions thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

included the following stipulations and undertakings, <i>viz.:</i></p>

<blockquote>“1.  The plaintiffs after realizing that
Defendants were not negligent in the performance of their respective duties as
regards the admission of their son Reynaldo de la Cerna at the Cebu City
Medical Center, have agreed to enter into this Compromise Agreement;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  The Defendants in order to buy peace and
without admitting any liability for the death of Reynaldo de la Cerna hereby
agree to grant financial assistance to the Plaintiffs in the total amount of
FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P50,000.00) (which) shall be paid by the Defendants in
the following proportion:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">About eleven (11) months later, however (and as already stated in
the opening paragraph of this opinion), respondent Commission on Audit (COA)
disallowed the "financial assistance" thus granted to the spouses de
la Cerna, in its Decision No. 1364, contained in its 3rd Indorsement dated 15
June 1990, <i>supra.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This decision reads in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>" * * * [I]t is not within the powers of the Sangguniang
Panlungsod of Cebu to provide, either under the general welfare clause or even
on humanitarian grounds, monetary assistance that would promote the economic
condition and private interests of certain individuals only.  The giving away of public funds to a
bereaved family in the form of financial assistance has definitely no causal
relation to the general welfare of the inhabitants of the community.  In fact, no real or substantial relation to
the public health, morals, or general welfare of the community can be perceived
from the act of giving such financial assistance."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent further stressed that not being a party to the
compromise agreement, it was not bound by it; and that any money claim arising
therefrom was subject to its usual audit "in pursuance of the valid
exercise and discharge of its constitutional power, authority and duty as an
independent body to audit all government accounts."</p>

<p class="BODY">The City of Cebu filed a Motion for Reconsideration dated August
15, 1991, but as already stated, the same was "denied due course" by
respondent Commission in its decision No. 2773.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent ruled that the motion was filed more than a year after receipt by
the City government of notice of its Decision No. 364 dated June 15, 1990 and
therefore, pursuant to Sections 50 and 51 of PD 1445,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
the decision had already become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In behalf of the City of Cebu, Mayor Tomas R. Osmeña has come to
this Court ascribing grave abuse of discretion to the COA and its Members in so
disallowing the city's appropriation of P30,000.00 made conformably with the
compromise agreement in the civil suit against the City, embodied in due course
in the Trial Court's judgment.  Mayor
Osmeña assails respondents' characterization of the city government's
appropriation as mere "financial assistance to private persons,"
pointing out that the City would have incurred a greater financial liability if
it had not worked out such an amicable settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court believes that public respondents' disallowance of the
appropriation is indeed tainted by grave abuse of discretion and should be
correspondingly rectified.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is to be sure no question that under the Constitution,
respondent COA has the power, authority, and duty to examine, audit, and settle
all accounts pertaining to revenue and receipts of, and expenditures, and uses
of funds and property, owned or held in trust by, or pertaining to the
Government, or any of its subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities,
including government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the exercise of its broad powers, particularly its auditing functions, the
COA is guided by certain principles and state policies to assure that
"government funds shall be managed, expended, utilized in accordance with
law and regulations, and safeguarded against loss or wastage * * * with a view
to ensuring efficiency, economy and effectiveness in the operations of
government."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There can thus be no question of the COA's competence to act on
the supplemental budget for 1989 of the City of Cebu.  Whether it acted in the exercise of sound discretion in respect
thereto is another matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears to the Court that respondent COA grievously
misconstrued the undertaking of Cebu City to pay P30,000.00 to the heirs of the
deceased Reynaldo de la Cerna.  For some
reason, perhaps partly because of the imprecise phraseology of the <i>Sangguniang
Panglunsod </i>'s resolution,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
respondent considered that undertaking as simply furnishing "monetary
assistance that would promote the economic condition and private interests of
certain individuals only, ** said financial assistance ** definitely (having)
no causal relation to the general welfare of the inhabitants of the
community."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appropriation of P30,000.00 by the <i>Sangguniang Panlungsod </i>of
Cebu City was considered by respondent out of context; it was construed as
intended only to promote the private interests of the de la Cerna family, as
merely a form of financial assistance to a bereaved family without causal
relation to the general welfare of the community.  In truth, as respondent was well aware, the appropriation was a
part of the package agreed upon by all the parties in Civil Case No. 4275 of
the Cebu RTC for the amicable settlement of the controversy; it may not be
considered independently of said amicable settlement; it would be meaningless
unless considered in the context of the compromise of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The participation by the City in negotiations for an amicable
settlement of a pending litigation and its eventual execution of a compromise
relative thereto, are indubitably within its authority and capacity as a public
corporation; and a compromise of a civil suit in which it is involved as a
party, is a perfectly legitimate transaction, not only recognized but even
encouraged by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">A compromise is a bilateral act or transaction that is expressly
acknowledged as a juridical agreement by the Civil Code and is therein dealt
with in some detail.  "A
compromise," declares Article 2208 of said Code, "is a contract
whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or
put an end to one already commenced."</p>

<p class="BODY">That definition is reflective of the general concept of a
compromise in other jurisdictions, as "an agreement between two or more
persons, who, for preventing or putting an end to a lawsuit, adjust their
difficulties by mutual consent in the same manner which they agree on, and
which everyone of them prefers in the hope of gaining, balanced by the danger
of losing."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code not only defines and authorizes compromises, it in
fact encourages them in civil actions.  Article 2029 states that "The Court shall endeavor to persuade the
litigants in a civil case to agree upon some fair compromise." And in line
with this policy, the Code directs (a) the suspension, pursuant to the Rules of
Court, of every civil action or proceeding "(1) if willingness to discuss
a possible compromise is expressed by one or both parties, or (2) if it appears
that one of the parties, before the commencement of the action or proceeding,
offered to discuss a possible compromise but the other party refused the
offer,"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as (b) the mitigation of "the damages to be paid by the losing
party who has shown a sincere desire for a compromise."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The law regards compromises as standing on a higher plane than ordinary
agreements, for it declares them, once entered into, to constitute <i>res
judicata</i>, although judicial execution thereof is permitted only with
respect to judicial compromises.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Code also affirms the capacity of juridical persons to
compromise, "in the form and with the requisites which may be necessary to
alienate their property."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As early as 1917, the Court, applying substantially similar provisions in the
(Spanish) Civil Code of 1889, made the following pronouncements in the case of <i>Municipality
of San Joaquin v. Bishop of Jaro</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"As a juridic person, the municipality of Miagao was
authorized to execute a contract of compromise in the manner and with the
requisites necessary to alienate its property (Civ. Code, art. 1812), and such
requisites and formalities were fulfilled in accordance with the provisions of
section 40, subsection (c) of the Municipal Code.  The provincial governor was of that opinion when he gave his
approval to the contract of compromise, which was deemed to benefit the
contracting municipality for the reason that it thereby avoided a lawsuit and
got the Church to renounce other claims and to recognize the municipality's
right in the other real properties sought to be registered.  Furthermore, the record does not show that
the Church, on its part, failed to comply with the condition imposed in the
compromise, and it is presumed that the latter was executed in accordance with
law and that the formalities established by law have been complied with (Code
of Civ. Proc., sec. 334, Nos. 14, 18 and 310.  There is no proof contrary to these presumptions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That the City of Cebu complied with the relevant formalities
contemplated by law can hardly be doubted.  The compromise agreement was submitted to its legislative council, the <i>Sangguniang
Panglungsod, </i>which approved it conformably with its established rules and
procedure, particularly the stipulation for the payment of P30,000.00 to the de
la Cerna family.  Neither may it be
disputed that since, as a municipal corporation, Cebu City has the power to sue
and be sued,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it has the authority to settle or compromise suits,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the obligation to pay just and valid claims against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, respondent refused to take account of the foregoing
legal principles in relation to the antecedents of the provision in the
supplemental budget of the City for payment of P30,000.00.  It failed to realize that payment thereof
was part of the consideration, not merely for the settlement of a claim, but
for the settlement of an actual controversy,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
and constituted one of the "reciprocal concessions" which the law
considers "the very heart and life of every compromise."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
By making reciprocal concessions, the parties in Civil Case No. 4275 of the
Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (Branch 23) put an end to the action in a
manner acceptable to all of them.  The
City thus eliminated the contingency of being made to assume heavier liability
in said suit for damages instituted against it in connection with its operation
and management of the Cebu City Medical Center, activities being undertaken by
it in its proprietary (as distinguished from its government) functions and in
accordance with which it may be held liable <i>ex contractu </i>or <i>ex
delito,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
for the negligent performance of its corporate, proprietary or business
functions.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the compromise in question was approved by,
and embodied in the judgment of, the Court, which pronounced it "to be in
conformity with law, morals and public policy" and enjoined the parties
"to comply strictly with the terms and conditions thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This judicial compromise is conclusive and binding on all the
parties, including the City of Cebu.  It
is enforceable by execution, as above stressed.  There was no reason whatever to object to it, much less disallow
any disbursement therein stipulated.  It
should have been approved as a matter of course. </p>

<p class="BODY">One last word.  COA avers<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
that its Decision dated June 15, 1990 (No. 1364) became final and executory by
reason of the City's failure to appeal the same to this Court within thirty
(30) days from notice thereof, pursuant to the Section 7, Article IX of the
Constitution, and Sections 50 and 51 of PD 1445.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
This is not indubitable on the record.  For against this contention, there is the allegation in the motion
(letter) for reconsideration dated August 15, 1991 of the City, thru its City
Attorney,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
that notice of the decision was "received on July 26, 1991;" and
there was at the time the far from settled question as to whether or not the
City Auditor, on whom said COA Decision No. 1364 dated June 15, 1990, is not
merely an extension (and transmitter of communications) of the Commission on
Audit, or may be deemed a proper officer (in lieu of or in addition to the
Mayor) on whom such notice should be given to effectively bind the City and to
commence computation of the appeal period prescribed by the Constitution and
implementing rules.  In view thereof,
and in the interest of justice, the Court declines to sustain the contention
that the City's right of appeal had lapsed and thus resolve the controversy at
bar on the basis of the postulated procedural default on the part of the City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the writ of <i>certiorari </i>prayed for is
issued and the COA decisions dated 15 June 1990 (No. 1364) and 30 March 1993 (No.
2773) are hereby nullified and set aside.  The respondent Commission on Audit is ORDERED to approve and allow in
audit the appropriation of P30,000.00 of Cebu City approved in connection with
the judicial compromise executed by it in Civil Case No. 4275 of the Regional
Trial Court of Cebu City (Branch 23).</p>
