events transpired, as summarized by the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> In June, after the seventh </span>and eighth
shipments, the defendant (<span class="SpellE">Buenasenso</span> SY) presented to
the plaintiff <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(Jaime LUZON) the
statement of account, Exhibit D, whereby defendant deducted from </span>the
value of the shipments all the advances, including the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">sun </span>of P3<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> still due on the
revolving capital, leaving a net proceed in favor of the plaintiff in the sum
of P1,963.19. This was received by the plaintiff and he signed the statement of
account, Exhibit D, on the promise of the defendant that he would send the
money to the plaintiff. When defendant failed to send the revolving ca­pital to
the plaintiff, the latter sent a telegram on <st1:date year="1969" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1969</st1:date>, Exhibit E, reiterating his request that
defendant transmit to him immediately the agreed amount and to wire his reply. Defendant
did not answer this letter. About the end of July, plaintiff came to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and asked the defendant to deliver to him the advance capital. Defendant did
not give it, and plaintiff had to beg him even for his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">expenses; </span>and defendant gave him the measly amount<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>of P50.00 for which he signed a
receipt dated <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1969</st1:date>.
When the advance capital was not forthcoming, the plaintiff wrote the letter, Exhibit
F, dated August 7, 1969, requesting that defendant correct the violation of the
terms of the agreement within sixty days from the receipt thereof, and that
'the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">same </span>(letter) shall be the
written notice in accordance with paragraph 6 of the contract.' Defendant
likewise did not answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this </span>letter.
Hence, on <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1969</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed the present complaint."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1971</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> rendered judgment against SY for having violated the
contract, even as the Court found that <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> was short
in deliveries, reasoning that since no demand or notice was served on him by
SY, apparently the latter had condoned such delinquent performance. The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of that Court's judgment reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the court finds for the
plaintiff. The terms of the contract between him and the defendant <span class="SpellE">Buenaseso</span> <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> having been violated
by the latter, the said defendant should pay unto the court or the plaintiff
the sum of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> representing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the revolving capital which ought to have
been paid by the defendant to plaintiff and the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS
(P20,000.00) liquidated damages; P2,000.00 for attorney's fees and the costs of
the proceedings."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On appeal by SY, the
Court of Appeals eliminated the sum of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

liquidated </span>damages, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is suing for
rescission and not for specific performance. The dispositive portion of the
Appellate Court's judgment reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>'WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered ordering the defendant to pay to
the plaintiff liquidated damages in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
and attorney's fees of P2,000.00. No costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In seeking a reduction of
damages, if not a reversal of the judgment before us, SY contends:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Liquidated damages must be reduced here the
claimant violated the terms of the contract and in any case where award becomes
unconscionable or inequitable; the nature and the circumstances of the
violation by the offender also a relevant factor in determining amount of
damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Other factors exist upon which to predicate
reversal or mitigation; petitioner's lack of bad faith important in determining
issue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no question that
liquidated damages of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">were
agreed upon by the parties in case of breach thereof. There is no question
either that SY had violated the contract by not continuing to provide the
revolving capital. As provided for by Article 2227 of the Civil Code, however,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Liquidated damages,
whether intended as an indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if
they are iniquitous or unconscionable."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the present case, the
Court of Appeals found as a fact that LUZON "had not delivered the 60 tons

therefore, neither complied faithfully with the agreement. Equitably,
therefore, since </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">LUZON</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> had also violated the contract, although the
violation was not actionable, and in the exercise of the Court's discretion, we
reduce the liquidated damages to P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, which
amount, we believe, is ade­quate for the purpose intended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
