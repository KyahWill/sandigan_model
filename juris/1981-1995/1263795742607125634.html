<p class="BODY">The primodial question to be resolved in the case at bar is
whether or not respondent court erred in denying petitioner's petition for
review filed pursuant to Sec. 38 of Act 496, (Land Registration Act) which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 38.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Decree of
registration, and remedies after entry of decree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the court after hearing finds that the applicant or adverse
claimant has title as stated in his application or adverse claim and proper for
registration, a decree of confirmation and registration shall be entered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Every decree of registration shall bind the
land, and quiet title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the
following section.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It shall be con­clusive
upon and against all persons, in­cluding the Insular Government and all the
branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice of
citation, or included in the general description 'To all whom it may concern'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such decree shall not be opened by reason of
the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person affected thereby, nor
by any procedding in any court for reversing judgments or decrees; subject,
however, to the right of any person deprived of land or of any estate or
interest therein by decree of registration obtained by fraud to file in the
competent Court of First Instance a petition for review within one year after
entry of the decree provided no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x </span>x
."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The essential elements for the allowance of the re­opening or
review of a decree are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) that the
petitioner has a real and dominical right; (b) that he has been deprived
thereof; (c) through fraud; (d) that the peti­tion is filed within one year
from the issuance of the decree; and (e) that the property has not as yet been
transferred to an innocent purchaser.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">However, for fraud to
justify the review of a decree, it must be extrinsic or collateral and the
facts upon which it is based have not been controverted or resolved in the ca</span>se<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> where the judgment sought to be annulled was
rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following ruling spells
out the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Extrinsic or collateral fraud, as distinguished from
intrinsic fraud, connotes any fraudulent scheme executed by a prevailing
litigant "outside the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">trial of a
case against the defeated party, or his agents, attorneys or witnesses, whereby
said defeated party, is prevented from presenting fully and fairly his side of
the case." But in­trinsic fraud takes the form of "acts of a party in
a litigation during the trial, such as the use of forged instruments or
perjured testimony, which did not affect the present action of the case, but
did prevent a fair and just determination of the case." (Libudan vs. Gil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">45 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">SCRA 17)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In
other words, extrinsic fraud is one that affects and goes into the jurisdiction
of the Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In its Petition for
Review filed before the respondent court, petitioner alleged that the Casajes
committed fraud </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">obtaining </span>said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

entitled to a review of a decree of registra­tion, are those who were
fraudulently deprived of their opportunity to be heard in the original
registration case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the
situation of the petitioner here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
not denied a day in court by fraud, which the law provides as the sole ground
for reopening of the decree of registra­tion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, it opposed the application but failed to substantiate its
opposition because it did not appear at the hearing of the registration case
despite proper notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Solomon et

failed to appear at the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere
allegation of fraud is not enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specific,
intentio­nal acts to deceive and deprive another of his right, or in some
manner injure him must be alleged and proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There must be actual or positive fraud as distinguished from
constructive fraud to entitle one to the reopening of a decree <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And </span>it must be extrinsic and not
intrinsic fraud (Greg Alba vs. de la Cruz, 17 Phil. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

necessary to maintain the stability of judicial decisions and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">save </span>the precious time of the courts
from being wasted by unnecessary proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the fact that the District Land Officer of the Bureau of Lands
conducted the corresponding inspection and investigation of the land in
question with its findings and report sub­mitted in court, renders the present
appeal interposed by the Director of Lands about valid basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot just simply deny the report of its
