<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1976</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order dismissing the petition on the ground that
Madrigal's cause of action was barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court rationalized its judgment as
follows (pp. 31-33, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"It is beyond question that herein petitioner was separated
from the service on <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="11"><u>November 25, </u><u><span style="">1971</span></u></st1:date>,<span style=""> </span>and it was only on <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="12"><u><span style="">December
 </span>15, 1975</u></st1:date>, or FOUR (4) YEARS and TWENTY (20) DAYS after,
that he filed this case for ‘<i>Mandamus</i> and Damages’ with the principal
aim of causing his reinstatement to the public position from where his service
was terminated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Much as the petitioner might have had a good cause of action,
it is unfortunate that that (sic) the same is now barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>.<u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A person claiming right to a position in the civil service should <span style="">file his </span>action

<blockquote>"The rationale for the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>

seeking reinstatement in the civil service is that the suitor thereby is guilty
of LACHES (National Shipyards and Steel Corporation vs. CIR, L-21675, May 23,
1967, 20 SCRA 134).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ruling is no doubt inspired by the provision of Section
16, Rule 66 of the Revised Rules of Court on 'Quo <span class="SpellE">Warranto</span>',
pertinent portion of which reads;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Madrigal assigns as errors the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) <span class="GramE">the</span> trial court erred in dismissing
the petition for <i><u>mandamus</u></i> and damages on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="GramE">assuming</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that his claim for reinstatement was not filed seasonably, the trial court
erred in not proceeding with the trial of the case on the merits to determine
the claim for back salaries and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first assignment of error, Madrigal alleges that
the one (1) year period prescribed in an action for <u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u>
is not applicable in an action for <i><u>mandamus</u></i> because Rule 65 of
the Rules of Court does not provide for such prescriptive period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The declaration by the trial court that the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of administrative <span style="">r</span>emedies does not operate to suspend the period o<span style="">f</span> one (1) year within which to file the
petition for <i><u><span style="">mandamus</span></u></i><span style="">, </span>should he confined to actions for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u> only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, he contends that exhaustion
of administrative remedies <span style="">is </span>a
condition <u>sine qua non</u> before one can petition for <i><u>mandamus</u></i>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span>the part of
public respondents, they aver that it has become an established part of our
jurisprudence, being a public policy repeatedly cited by the courts in myriad
of <i><u>mandamus</u></i> cases, that actions for reinstatement should be brought
within one year from the date of <span class="GramE">dismissal,</span> otherwise,
they will be barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>laches</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of an
administrative remedy before the Commission does not stop the running of the
one (1) year period within which a <i><u>mandamus</u></i> case for
reinstatement should be <span style="">filed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The unbending jurisprudence in this jurisdiction is to the effect
that a petition <span style="">for <u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u></span> and <i><u>mandamus</u></i> affecting

762).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason behind this
ruling was expounded in the case of <span class="SpellE">Unabia</span> v. City
Mayor, etc., 99 Phil. 253 where <span class="GramE">We</span> said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span class="GramE">:[</span>W]e note that in actions of <i style="">quo</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">warranto</i></span><span style=""> </span>involving right to an office, the
action must be instituted within the period of one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been the law in the island since
1901, the period having been originally fixed in Section 216 of the Code of
Civil Procedure (Act No. 190). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>We find
this provision <span style="">to be an expression of
policy on the part of the State that persons claiming a right to an office </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">which they are illegally dispossessed should immediately take steps to
recover said office and that if they do not do so within </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">period of one year, they shall be considered as having lost their right
thereto by abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are
weighty reasons of </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">policy and convenience that demand the
adoption of a similar period for persons claiming rights to positions in the
civil service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">There </span><span style="">must be stability in the service so </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">public business may
(sic) be unduly retarded; delays in the statement of the right to positions in
the service must be discouraged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
following considerations as to public officers, by Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, may well be applicable </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">employees in the civil service:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Furthermore, constitutional rights may certainly be waived, and
the inaction of the officer for one year could be validly considered as waiver,
<span style="">i.e., </span>a renunciation which no
principle of justice may prevent, he <span style="">being
at liberty to resign his position anytime he pleases.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'And there is good justification for the limitation period; it is <span style="">not </span>proper that the title to public
office should be subjected to continued uncertainly (sic), and the peoples’ interest
requires that such right should be determined as speedily as <span style="">practicable.' <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(<span class="SpellE">Tumulak</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Egay</span>, 46 <span class="GramE">Off</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaz</span></span><span class="GramE">., [8], 3693, 3695.)</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Further, the Government must be immediately informed or
advised if any person claims to be entitled to an office or a position in the<span style=""> civil service as against another actually
holding it, so that the Government may not be faced with the predicament of
having to pay two salaries, one, for the person actually holding the office,
although illegally, and another, </span>for one not actually rendering service
although entitled to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that
view of the policy of the State contained in the law fixing the period of one
year within which actions for <i style=""><span style="">quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></span></i><span style=""> may </span>be
instituted, any person claiming right to a position in the civil service should
also be required to file his petition for reinstatement within the period of
one year, otherwise he is thereby considered as having abandoned his
office."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The fatal drawback of Madrigal's cause is
that he came to court out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE"><span style="">a</span>forestated</span>,
it was only after four <span style="">(4) </span><span style="">y</span><span style="">ears
and twenty (20) days from the abolition of his position that he filed the
petition for <i><u>mandamus</u></i></span> <span style="">and damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This single
circumstance has closed the door for any judicial remedy in his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And this one (1) year period is not interrupted by the
prosecution of any administrative remedy (Torres v. <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>,
88 Phil. 436).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, the recourse by
Madrigal to the Commission was unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is fundamental that in a case where pure questions of law are raised,
the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies cannot <span style="">apply </span><span style="">because issues of law cannot be resolved with finality by the
administrative officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appeal to the
administrative officer of orders involving questions of law would be an
exercise in futility since administrative officers cannot decide such issues
with finality (<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Oxygen </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Acetylene Co., Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, et al., G.R.
No. 82849, August 2, 1989, citing <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> v.
Provincial Board of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
106 Phil. 466; <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span>,
97 Phil. 143).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, only
a legal question is to be resolved, that is, whether or not the abolition </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">Madrigal’s position was in accordance with law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second assignment of error, Madrigal asserts
that despite (1) the ruling of the Commission declaring his removal from office
illegal; (2) <span style="">Resolution No. 93 of the
Provincial Board; and (3) Provincial Voucher No. 714 covering the appropriation
for the sum of P3<span class="GramE">,667.29</span>, representing his back
salaries for said period, the trial court still refused to grant his </span><span style="">money claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In answer thereto, public respondents contend that the court
cannot <span style="">pass </span>upon Madrigal's right
to back salaries without passing upon the validity of the abolition of his
position which is a matter that cannot now be a subject of judicial
inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the question
of back <span style="">salaries and damages is only
incidental to the issues involving the validity of said abolition and </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">request for reinstatement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, </span><span class="GramE">We</span> uphold the view advanced by public respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Madrigal loses sight of the fact that the
claim for back salaries and damages cannot stand by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal action having failed, perforce,
the incidental <span style="">action must likewise
fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to state, the claim for
back salaries and damages is also subject to the prescriptive period of one (1)
year (see Gutierrez </span><span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bachrach</span></span><span style=""> Motor Co., Inc., 105 Phil. </span><span style="">9).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
