				<H3>OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE JOSE B. GATICALES, MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, KABANKALAN, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This administrative matter
refers to the charges of gross misconduct brought by the office of the Court
Administrator against Judge Jose Gaticales of the Municipal Trial Court of
Kabankalan, Negros Occidental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>antecedent
facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated April 16, 1991, a certain Anna Marie Lopez (her
pseudonym) charged the respondent for abusive, unethical, indecent and corrupt
practices.  After looking closely at the
matter, this <span style="">Court, </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">its </span>resolution dated April 23, 1991, directed the Office of the
Court Administrator (OCA) to <span style="">file </span>a
verified complaint against the respondent and asked the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI) to investigate Lopez’ allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting pursuant to our resolution, the OCA charged the respondent
with gross misconduct for: (1) extracting money from litigants; (2) demanding
"lagay" before issuing warrants of arrest; (3) charging exorbitant
fees for marriage licenses; (4) immoral advances against a lady litigant and
(5) being a heavy drinker and smoker.  As a result of the NBI investigation, sufficient evidence to support a
prima facie case on the first four charges <span style="">was </span>ascertained.  The
report of the NBI and its annexes were referred to Executive Judge Layumas to
whom this Court referred the case for evaluation and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Executive Judge Layumas, then, set the case for hearing.  The following witnesses testified against
the respondent:</p>

<blockquote><u>VIRGILIO</u> <u><span style="">WEE</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>TESTIFIED</u>
<u><span style="">AS</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>FOLLOWS</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">That he is a lessee of a
commercial/residential building situated at Lerazan Street, Kabankalan, Negros

that a case for Ejectment was filed against him by the Olvido spouses, new
owners of the building, with the Municipal Trial Court of Kabankalan, Negros
Occidental presided by the respondent Judge Jose Gaticales; that after </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">few
hearings of the said case he was called by the respondent Judge to his chamber
for a conference where he was told that he (Judge) can delay the decision of
his case if he wants to, that he left without entertaining what the Judge told
him; that a few days later the respondent Judge went to his store and got some
item</span><span style="">s</span><span style=""> like gear oil, super motor oil, grease,
brake fluid for which he signed a "vale" for P324.00 worth of goods;
that said items were not paid until this investigation; that on other
subsequent occasions, he got other merchandise like accelerator spring, motor
oil, brake fluid, sets of sandpaper, grinding compound, grinding stick, steel
brush, contact point and condenser, fan belt and this time he did not sign a Vale
anymore; that much later the said Judge demanded for cash so, he had to give

forum the respondent Judge who represented his wife as member of the NOCECO,
took hold of the microphone and began talking in an unintelligible manner for

problem; that he was able to give the Judge P1,000.00 as well as soft drinks

a sentimental value to him being a gift from his mother; that the Englishman

before an NBI agent, copy of which is now marked as Exhibit "G".  (Judge Layumas' report, pp. 4-11)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, on the other hand, denies the various charges
against him.  His answers to the
accusations against him are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>respondent Judge
testified in substance that the complaint filed by Annie (sic) Marie Lopez
should not have been entertained for said person does not exist; that the
charges filed by Virgilio Wee against him are all false for everytime he gets
any article from the store of Wee he always pay either through his driver, his
children or himself; that Wee made some overtures to him regarding his pending
case in respondent's sala, but, he ignored this and rendered a decision against
Wee so that, it aroused his ire; that Wee filed an administrative case against
him before the Supreme Court but, same was dismissed as shown in a decision
dated, September 17, 1990 that he has not received any money from Wee;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the testimony of Jose V. Pioquinto regarding his behavior
during the NOCECO members general assembly meeting on March 31, 1990 was not
true for he did not misbehave nor, was he drunk as charged, at that time,
although his face was red because of the heat of the sun.  Defense witness Salvio Alvior testified that
he was at the general assembly meeting of the members of the NOCECO at the
latter's compound but, he did not see Judge Gaticales talking <span style="">or </span>was drunk although his face was red
at the time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That with respect to charge of Artemio Noble that he asked for
money and palay the same are all false for the truth is that he has more palay
than Noble; that Noble testified against him because his case was dismissed,
although, his wife has a relative who has a case before his sala, filed
sometime in 1990 or 1991 which is pending up to the present;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the assertions of Lilia Voluntate are all false because he
never received the amount of P300.00 taken from the bail bond put up by a certain
Nuida <span style="">for </span>Lilia's husband; that
Voluntate filed a case against him with the Supreme Court for Anti-Graft and
disrespectful conduct which is docketed as MTJ-90-444, which <span style="">is </span>still pending; that he never
intervened in the withdrawal of the bail bond for Voluntate's husband;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That Brigida Engojo is a troublesome woman who has been convicted
in several cases rendered either by Judge Magahud or Judge Mana-ay who are MTC
Judges;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That he has not received any money from Victor Garde as alleged by
him, although Garde approached him regarding a case but, he did not entertain
Garde for he wanted that Garde should bring the matter to Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That as regards the testimony of witness Joaquin Lo Grandeza the
same was not true, except, with respect to the "Vale" in the amount
of P324.00 which bears his signature and which he was willing to pay even
during the trial;</blockquote>

<blockquote>That with respect to the story of witness Lazaro Monte Castro
regarding his Englishman nephew-in-law, they were all untrue, although he
admits having solemnized the marriage of his niece to an Englishman."  (Judge Layumas' report, pp. 11-14)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon hearing the evidence for and against the respondent,
Executive Judge Layumas has the following conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx the respondent Judge Jose B. Gaticales is GUILTY of Gross
Misconduct as charged, by committing the following acts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>getting some articles on credit from the store
of Virgilio Wee, a litigant in his sala, without paying for the same <span style="">in </span>spite of the lapse of more than two
(2) years since he signed the vale for said goods;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style=""> </span>  extracting the amount of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos from Virgilio
Wee, a litigant in his sala;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>misbehaving before a crowd of more than Seven
Thousand (7,000) people, who are members of the NOCECO during a general assembly
meeting, with high ranking national and local leaders present during said
meeting, by talking with the use of a microphone in a manner that he could not
be understood for he was under the influence of liquor, and throwing the
microphone to the ground to the dishonor of the Judiciary;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>withholding the amount of Three Hundred
(P300.00) Pesos from the cash bonds <span style="">of </span>Gonzalo
Voluntate and asking for another twenty (P20.00) pesos from the Voluntate
couple."</blockquote>

<blockquote>The other charges of:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">a) </span>demanding
"lagay" before issuing warrants of arrests;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) charging exhorbitant fees for marriage licenses;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) immoral advances against a lady litigant;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) being a heavy
smoker;</blockquote>

<blockquote>are recommended for
dismissal for insufficiency of evidence. (Judge Layumas' report, pp. 30-31, 33)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Judge recommended a two-year suspension without pay
for the respondent Judge.  Furthermore,
the Executive Judge stated that once reinstated, the respondent be transferred
to another court as he will not be an effective dispenser of justice in Kabankalan
because of the petition (Exhibit "10") signed by many citizens of
that municipality asking for his dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court agrees with the above findings of the Executive
Judge.  However, we find that the
recommended penalty is too light for the acts of gross misconduct committed <span style="">by </span>the respondent.  The correct penalty should be dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive Judge found the testimonies of Virgilio Wee and
Lilia Voluntate to be credible.  He
stated that the giving of the P3,000 by Virgilio Wee to the respondent had
something to do with the delay in the execution of the respondent's decision
against Wee.  (Judge Layumas' report, p.
22) As with regards to Lilia Voluntate's charges, the respondent merely denied
said charges.  He did not even subpoena
the treasurer of Kabankalan to testify that he had nothing to do with the
withdrawal of the cash bonds.  (Judge
Layumas' report, p. 25)</p>

<p class="BODY">These acts of the respondent show that he can be influenced by
monetary considerations.  These acts of
the respondent of demanding and receiving money from a party-litigant before
his court constitute serious misconduct <span style="">in
o</span>ffice.  It is this kind of gross
and flaunting misconduct, no matter how nominal the amount involved, on the
part of those who are charged with the responsibility of administering the law
and rendering justice that so quickly and surely corrodes the respect for law
and the courts without which government cannot continue and that tears apart <span style="">the very </span>bonds of our polity.  (Haw Tay v. Singayao, 154 SCRA 107, 111-112
[1987])</p>

<p class="BODY">Such acts go against Canons 2 and 3 of the Code of Judicial
Conduct which state:  A Judge should <u>avoid</u>
<u>impropriety</u> and the appearance of impropriety <u>in</u> <u>all</u> <u>activities</u>
and a judge should perform official duties <u>honestly</u>, and with impartiality
and diligence (underlining supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Mejia</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Pamaran</u>, 160 SCRA
457, 477 [1988]), we held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Those who are involved in the administration of justice from
the highest to the lowest level must live up to the strictest standard of
honesty and integrity in the public service.  The general public should respect and support such imperative.  No attempt to influence them one way or the
other much less to bribe them should be made.  One cannot buy a bad case nor sell a good one.  No amount of money can make out a good case out of a bad
one.  And even if one succeeds in so
doing it would certainly be uncovered and reversed on appeal.  Justice will prevail."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Although the other charges of extracting money from litigants (as
to the charges of Noble and Engojo) were not proven for lack of witnesses
willing to stand up in public against a Judge, this Court is just as concerned
about the poor reputation that Judge Gaticales has developed in
Kabankalan.  A Judge anywhere should be
the last person to be perceived as no better than a mulcting traffic cop or a
corrupt bureaucrat out to make money at every turn.  The reputation of the respondent unfortunately appears to have
preceded him, and while situations are possible where a judge is unfairly
ruined by well-orchestrated attempts of disgruntled litigants or power blocs or
influential members of the community whose interests are threatened by a
judge's zeal and integrity, no evidence has been shown in this case that the
mounting complaints against the Judge are the byproducts of similar
maneuvers.  At any rate, the thing
itself has spoken, and it has spoken eloquently.  (Office of the Court Administrator v. Bartolome, Adm. Matter No.
RTJ-90-446, November 7, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent ruined his reputation by misbehaving in front of a
crowd of more than 7,000 people.  After
a lapse of more than 2 years, he has not paid his P324.00 debt to Virgilio
Wee.  Only during the hearing did the
respondent offer to pay for it.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these acts of the respondent constitute gross misconduct that
deserves <span style="">a </span>penalty of dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Judge Jose Gaticales, is hereby DISMISSED from
the service with forfeiture of all salaries, benefits and leave credits to
which he may be entitled. <span style="">  </span>Copies of the decision are furnished
the Secretary of Justice and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines for possible
prosecution and disbarment proceedings.  The dismissal is with prejudice to <span style="">re-em</span>ployment
