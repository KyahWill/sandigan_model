				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn "Charge Sheet" dated November 23, 1987 and
filed with the Court on December 1, 1987, which was signed by nine (9)
employees of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 4, in <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, in the name of the Association of Court
Employees of <span class="SpellE">Panabo</span>, of which they professed to be
members, said Association accused the presiding judge of said court, Mariano C.
<span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>, of corruption and dishonesty (10 counts),
oppression and abusive and immoral conduct unbecoming a judge (2 counts), and
sought an investigation and hearing of the charges and imposition of the
appropriate penalty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court acted on the charges by issuing a Resolution on
December 10, 1987 placing the respondent Judge under preventive suspension and
directing him to answer the charges within ten (10) days.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1987</st1:date>, the
respondent filed a 12-page verified answer with nineteen (19) annexes<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and, simultaneously, a motion to lift his suspension and to detail him to
another RTC <span class="SpellE">sala</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court Administrator favorably endorsed the motion and on <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1988</st1:date>, the Court issued a
Resolution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
lifting the respondent's suspension effective immediately, detailing the latter
to Branch 19, Regional Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Digos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and referring the
complaint to Associate Justice Hector C. <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> of the
Court of Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the record of the case, Justice <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> scheduled daily hearings for two successive
weeks:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="3">March 7-11, 1988</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="3">March 14-18, 1988</st1:date>, in his chambers in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for reception of the evidence of the parties, the case thereafter to be deemed
submitted for resolution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He subsequently denied a motion of the complainant association conduct the
investigation in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant, however, took its plea for a change of venue to
this Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
which granted the same, set aside that portion of its earlier Resolution
referring the complaint to Justice <span class="SpellE">Fule</span> for
investigation and instead directed Deputy Court Administrator <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Ranjo</span> to conduct and
terminate said investigation in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City in the
chambers of the Executive Judge of that City, from April 11 to 15, 1988, and to
submit his report and recommendation within thirty days.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In carrying out the Court's directive, Deputy Court Administrator
<span class="SpellE">Ranjo</span> received the testimony of twenty-five (25)
witnesses, eleven (11) for the complainant and fourteen (14) for the
respondent, in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, during the period <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="4">April 11-16, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also admitted thirteen (13) exhibits, some
with integral markings, for the complainant and fifty-nine (59) exhibits, also
with integral markings, for the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Memorandums were thereafter submitted, and on <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1988</st1:date>, the Investigator submitted a
42-page report and recommendation dated <st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="8">August
 1, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigator's report groups the specific charges against the
respondent under four (4) general headings, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Corruption and
dishonesty for (1) using the cash collections of the Court; (2) collecting
P150.00 as fee for solemnizing marriage; (3) incurring obligations without any
intention of paying them; (4) ordering police officers to cut <span class="SpellE">narra</span>, knowing the same to be prohibited, and without
paying for the same; (5) receiving one truckload of ramie roots which are the
subject matter of Civil Case No. 86-36, entitled ‘<span class="SpellE">Margarito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hadia</span> vs. Santos <span class="SpellE">Barbarona</span>’;
(6) directing Station Commander P/Capt. <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Donayre</span>, Jr., P/Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagape</span> and P/Cpl. Rafael B. <span class="SpellE">Dolon</span>
to order lumber from lumberyards without paying for it, thus forcing said
police officers to pay the same out of their own pockets; (7) always asking
gasoline from the municipal mayor who had to give cash from his own pocket; (8)
convincing the defendant in Civil Case No. 87-29 entitled ‘Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Longa</span> vs. Leonardo Longo,’ to discharge his lawyer Atty.
Samuel <span class="SpellE">Oscena</span>, so he could arrange (fix) the case for
a fee; (9) exacting money from litigants and employees; and (10) requiring the
Deputy Sheriff to give him P100.00 to P300.00 for every foreclosure, attachment
or execution the sheriff conducted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oppression,
Abusive and Immoral Conduct for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
interfering with the court stenographers for the payment of transcript of
stenographic notes; (2) making immoral advances on female employees; (3)
ordering lawyers to file charges against his own employees; and (4) actively
participating in the settlement of cases and sharing in the money settlement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inefficiency
for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) not reporting on Mondays,
holding sessions at 9:30 A.M., and leaving the Court at 2:00 P.M., and issuing
Certificates of Service showing that he is reporting on Mondays and as
prescribed by law; and (2) not disposing of cases within the prescribed 90-day
period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IV.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conduct unbecoming
a Judge for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) selling raffle tickets
of the Knights of Rizal of which he is a ranking officer; and (2) openly
drinking in the company of friends at public places."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court has carefully considered the Investigator's Report in
the light of the testimonial and documentary evidence presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said document not only comprehensively
summarizes the evidence for both sides; it also exhaustively analyzes the same
and details the reasons for the Investigator's assessment of its weight and
credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There appears no reason for
faulting that notable effort in any particular and, indeed, every reason to
uphold it as correct and in accordance with the proffered proof in every
substantive aspect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court hereby adopts the findings set out in the
Report of the Investigator, and approves the recommendations made therein for
the dismissal, for insufficiency of evidence and/or want of merit, of all the
charges alleged in the complaint <u>except</u> those of (a) receiving gasoline,
or money with which to purchase it, from parties directly or indirectly
interested in cases pending in his (respondent's) court, and (b) accepting from
Leo Caballero, OIC Branch Clerk of Court of respondent's former <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, the amount of P1,000.00 to help defray his expenses
in <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> to the Supreme Court, Manila, to
requisition supplies, accountable forms and books while the recommendation of
said Mr. Caballero to the position of Legal Researcher was being considered by
him (respondent), which acts were either admitted by said respondent or
sufficiently established by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has, time and again, reminded members of the Judiciary
to so conduct themselves as to be beyond reproach and suspicion, and be free
from any appearance of impropriety in their personal behavior, not only in the
discharge of their official duties but also in their everyday life, for as we
have earlier stressed, "no position exacts a greater demand on moral
righteousness and uprightness of an individual than a seat in the
Judiciary" so that "(a) magistrate of the law must comport himself at
all times<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in such a manner that his
conduct, official or otherwise, can bear the most searching scrutiny of the
public that looks up to him as the epitome of integrity and justice."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> proven or admitted
actuations of respondent constitute serious misconduct meriting commensurate
administrative sanction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Judge Mariano C. <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>
is held guilty of grave misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
is hereby SUSPENDED from office for six (6) months without pay effective
immediately, and sternly warned that commission of other acts of misconduct
will warrant more severe sanctions from the Court.</p>
