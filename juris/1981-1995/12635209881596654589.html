Sought to be annulled in this petition for review is a final and 
executory judgment rendered by the City Court [now Metropolitan Trial 
Court] of Manila in Civil Case No. 057662-CV on ground of lack of 
jurisdiction.  Petitioners contend that the Court did not acquire 
jurisdiction over the case for failure of respondent Jose Planas, 
plaintiff therein, to avail of the barangay conciliation process before 
the filing of the case in court, as required by P.D. 1508, otherwise 
known as the "Katarungang Pambarangay Law."
<p>
The facts upon which this issue rests are the following:  The spouses 
Apolinar R. Royales and Presentacion Gregorio, petitioners herein, are 
the lessees of a residential house owned by respondent Jose Planas 
located at No. 1866 Int. I, Oroquieta St., Manila.  On August 25, 1980, 
Planas instituted before the then City Court of Manila an ejectment suit
 against petitioners, docketed as Civil Case No. 057662-CV and assigned 
to the sala of Judge J. Cesar Sangco.
</p><p>
Issues having been joined, trial on the merits ensued.  Respondent 
Planas testified on his own behalf and was cross-examined by 
petitioners' counsel.
</p><p>
On November 10, 1981, when neither petitioners nor their counsel 
appeared at the hearing despite due notice, the case, on motion of 
respondent Planas, was considered submitted for decision.  On November 
26, 1981, the trial court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion 
of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby accordingly rendered ordering 
defendants and all persons holding or claiming under them to immediately
 vacate the house located at No. 1866 Int. I Oroquieta Street, Sta. 
Cruz, Manila, subject of this action and restore possession thereof to 
the plaintiff and to pay the latter; </p>
  <p> "1.  The sum of P1,000.00 as and for attorney's fees; and </p>
  <p> "2.  The costs of suit."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
After the decision had become final and executory, Planas filed a motion
 for execution and the same was granted by the court.  Execution of the 
judgment was however restrained by the Regional Trial Court of Manila 
upon the filing by petitioners of a petition for certiorari and 
prohibition with preliminary injunction, wherein they assailed the said 
decision on ground of lack of jurisdiction, allegedly arising from 
failure of respondent Planas to submit the dispute to the Barangay Lupon
 for conciliation as required by P.D. 1508.
</p><p>
After due hearing, the Regional Trial Court handed down a decision 
declaring the judgment of the trial court null and void for having been 
rendered without jurisdiction.  Having found that "the parties in the 
case are residents not only of the same city, but of the same barangay, 
i.e., Bgy. 336, Zone 34, District 2, City of Manila," the Court ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Like the court of origin, this court is equally barren of 
jurisdiction to take cognizance of the subject controversy which was 
prematurely filed with the city court, even before it could be referred 
to the barangay authorities for conciliation, as explicitly required 
under P.D. 1508, something the private respondent admittedly failed to 
do.  The failure to allow the LUPON to act on the controversy at bar 
prior to the institution of the instant ejectment case did render the 
city court, and even this court, devoid of competence and jurisdiction 
to pass upon the present complaint of private respondent.  There is, 
therefore, no recourse left but to dismiss it, without prejudice to 
refiling it after due observance of the formalities prescribed by law on
 the matter."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reconsideration of the decision having been denied, respondent Planas 
appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court, which on July 12, 1982 
promulgated a decision vacating the judgment of the Regional Trial 
Court, thus confirming the decision of the City Court of Manila.  Unable
 to obtain a reconsideration thereof, petitioners filed the instant 
petition before this Court.
</p><p>
The petition is devoid of merit.
</p><p>
In disputes covered by P.D. 1508, as in the case at bar, the barangay 
conciliation process is a pre-condition for the filing of an action in 
court.  This is so provided by Section 6 of the said law:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 6.  Conciliation, pre-condition to filing of complaint.  -
 No complaint, petition, action or proceeding involving any matter with 
in the authority of the Lupon as provided in Section 2 hereof shall be 
filed or instituted in Court or any other government office for 
adjuÂ­dication unless there has been a confrontation of the parties 
before the Lupon Chairman or Pangkat and no conciliation or settlement 
had been reached as certified by the Lupon Secretary or the Pangkat 
Secretary attested by the Lupon or Pangkat Chairman or unless the 
settlement has been repudiated.  x x x."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is no dispute that prior to the filing of the complaint, the case 
was never referred to the Barangay Lupon for conciliation.  In fact, 
respondent Planas failed to allege in his complaint compliance with this
 condition precedent.  But is this omission fatal?
</p><p>
Ordinarily, non-compliance with the condition precedent prescribed by 
P.D. 1508 could affect the sufficiency of the plaintiff's cause of 
action and make his complaint vulnerable to dismissal on ground of lack 
of cause of action or prematurity<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
 ; but the same would not prevent a court of competent jurisdiction from
 exercising its power of adjudication over the case before it, where the
 defendants, as in this case, failed to object to such exercise of 
jurisdiction in their answer and even during the entire proceedings <em>a quo</em>.
</p><p>
While petitioners could have prevented the trial court from exercising 
jurisdiction over the case by seasonably taking exception thereto, they 
instead invoked the very same jurisdiction by filing an answer and 
seeking affirmative relief from it.  What is more, they participated in 
the trial of the case by cross-examining respondent Planas.  Upon this 
premise, petitioners cannot now be allowed belatedly to adopt an 
inconsistent posture by attacking the jurisdiction of the court to which
 they had submitted themselves voluntarily.  As this Court ruled in 
Tijam vs. Sibonghanoy:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p> ". . . . . .  a party cannot invoke the jurisdiction of a court to
 secure affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or 
failing to obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same 
jurisdiction (Dean vs. Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86, A.L.R. 79). </p>
  <p> "In the case just cited, by way of explaining the rule, it was 
further said that the question whether the court had jurisdiction either
 of the subject-matter of the action or the parties was not important in
 such cases because the party is barred from such conduct not because 
the judgment or order of the court is valid and conclusive as an 
adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be 
tolerated -- obviously for reasons of public policy. </p>
  <p> "Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily 
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, 
it is too late for the loser to question the jurisdiction or power of 
the court ....  And in Littleton vs. Burges, 16 Wyo. 58, the Court said 
that 'it is not right for a party who has affirmed and invoked the 
jurisdiction of a court in a particular matter to secure an affirmative 
relief, to afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to escape a penalty."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby dismissed and the decision of the 
respondent Intermediate Appellate Court in AC-G.R. -SP-00342 is hereby 
affirmed.  Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED.

CONCURRING OPINION
</strong>
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
A simple ejectment case has gone all the way to this Court and assigned 
not to a Division thereof but to the Banc on what appears to be a legal 
question of some novelty but which to me does not deserve the treatment 
accorded to it.  I think it is enough that the case has gone before the 
City Court, the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeals.  But 
having reached this Court and for this Court only to affirm the decision
 of the Court of Appeals, a simple denial of the petition instead of the
 full treatment given to it would have been sufficient and more 
appropriate.
