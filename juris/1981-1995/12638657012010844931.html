				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision dated February 27,
1976 of the Court of Appeals, affirming the decision of the then Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, dated February 27, 1970 which
declared as null and void Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1439 in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>, ordered
its cancellation and the reinstatement of Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-1412 of the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim
Kit.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="6" month="9">September 6, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit, represented by his uncle, <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Tong U, filed <span style="">in
</span>the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> against <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> an action for
cancellation of the latter’s Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">T-­1439.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged that <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit, a Chinese national and son of defendant <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>, is the absolute owner of a commercial lot and
building on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
registered in his <span class="GramE">name</span> under TCT No. T­-1412 of the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> City; that in 1945, <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit went to mainland China; that he was prevented
from returning to the Philippines when the Communists took over mainland China;
that through letters, he requested <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Tong U to take
care of his aforementioned property; that although defendant <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> was aware that her son was still alive, she executed
an affidavit on May 21, 1963, alleging that he had died and adjudicating to
herself, as his sole heir, the above-described property:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that by means of said affidavit of
adjudication, she was able to obtain Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1439
in her name; that she thereafter mortgaged the property to the Philippine
National Bank, <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> Branch, to secure a loan of
P25,000; and that she is about to dispose of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1968</st1:date>,
the defendant filed her answer, admitting that <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
Kim Kit was still alive but she alleged that she signed the affidavit of
adjudication without having read its contents, the same being written in
English which she does not understand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As affirmative defense, she alleged that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Chu</span>
Tong U is not the real party in interest, being only an uncle of <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit and co-heir to his estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lucy Perez and the Philippine National Bank, as mortgagees, were
allowed by the trial court to intervene in the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1970</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Declaring
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1439 null and void and the Philippine
National Bank, <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> Branch, now in possession of
said title is required to surrender the same to the Register of Deeds for the
Province of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, and the said Register of Deeds is
ordered to cancel the same.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2<span class="GramE">)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After</span> the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No.
T-1439, the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> is ordered to
restore and/or reinstate Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1412 in form and
substance as it was before its cancellation, without encumbrance annotated
therein except those that were appearing if any there was before the same was
cancelled.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the
mortgages of the property described in said title in favor of the Philippine
National Bank and Lucy Perez are declared null and void insofar as the property
described in the reinstated Transfer Certificate of Title No. T­-1412 is <span class="GramE">concerned,</span> however, said mortgages are valid evidence of the
existence of the debts of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>
to the mortgagee, Philippine National Bank and Lucy Perez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> remains liable to the Philippine National Bank and
Lucy Perez for whatever indebtedness <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> obtained from either creditor, Philippine National
Bank and Lucy Perez.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> is ordered to pay
the costs." <span class="GramE">(pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, Philippine National
Bank and Lucy Perez, appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1976</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered judgment affirming the trial court's
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff is <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit, the
real party in interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no question that <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim
Kit is an innocent party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not
committed any act to cause any damage to the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Granting, <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that the
<span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> are mortgagees in good faith, as between
them and the innocent <span class="GramE">owner,</span> the latter is entitled to
first consideration (Mejia vs. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span>, et al., 6
Court of Appeals Reports, 266).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> have a remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They can proceed against the defendant in a
personal action for the recovery of the loans extended to her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> paid by the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Lucy Perez to the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Philippine National Bank is a personal obligation of the defendant and cannot
be considered as a lien on the land in question which admittedly belongs to <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit." <span class="GramE">(pp. 36-37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PNB is now before us seeking a review of the Court of
Appeals’ decision on the grounds that it -</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">does</span>
not conform with the evidence; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">it</span>
is contrary to the applicable law and jurisprudence on the matter.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the Supreme Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts, it has the authority to review and reverse
the factual findings of the lower courts if it finds that they do not conform
to the evidence in the record (<span class="SpellE">Ongsiako</span> vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 152 SCRA 627).</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> Kim Kit
entrusted his Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-1412 to his mother, <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>, before he left for
mainland China and allowed his mother to administer the property, and to enjoy
its fruits in his absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those acts of
his enabled <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>
to cause the cancellation of TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-1412 and to obtain TCT
No.</span> <span class="GramE">T-1439 in her name.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> was administering his property may also have created
the impression in the mind of third persons that she was the owner of the
property and could dispose of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
plain to see that by his own acts of confidence in <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>, the private respondent was partly to blame
for the commission of the fraud against himself by his mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As between him and the petitioner which was
totally innocent and free from negligence or wrongdoing in the transaction, the
latter is entitled to the protection of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the petitioner PNB is a mortgagee in
good faith and for value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time
the mortgage was constituted on the property on <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1963</st1:date>, it was covered by TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-1439 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
title carried no annotation, defect or flaw that would have aroused suspicion <span style="">as </span>to its authenticity. "The
certificate of title was in the name of the mortgagor when the land was
mortgaged to the PNB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
case, petitioner PNB had the right to rely on what appeared on the certificate
of title, and in the absence of anything to excite suspicion, it was under no
obligation to look beyond the certificate and investigate the title of the
mortgagor appearing on the face of the certificate." (Gonzales vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 157 SCRA 587; Phil. Coop. Bank vs. <span class="SpellE">Carangdang</span>, 139 SCRA 570; <span class="SpellE">Penullar</span>
vs. PNB, 120 SCRA 171; Blanco vs. <span class="SpellE">Esquierdo</span>, 110
Phil. 494.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling of the trial court and the Court of Appeals that as
the cancellation of TCT No. T-1412 was unauthorized and illegal, the issuance
of TCT No. T-1439 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> was null and void and the mortgage in favor of the
PNB was likewise null and void, contravenes existing jurisprudence on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the petitioner's
argument in its brief that:</p>

<blockquote>"In accordance with the provisions and the underlying policies
and intentions of the Land Registration Law, a Transfer Certificate of Title
appearing in the name of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span>
although <span class="SpellE">defeasible</span> in the hands of <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Boyano</span> is conclusive and
indefeasible in the hands of the petitioner which is an innocent mortgagee for
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Although generally a forged or fraudulent deed is a nullity and
conveys no title, however there are instances when such a fraudulent document
may become the root of a valid title.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One such instance is where the certificate of title was already
transferred from the name of <span style="">the true
owner to the forger, and</span> <span style="">while
it remained that way, the land was subsequently sold to an innocent
purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For then, the vendee had the
right to rely upon what appeared in the certificate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"'Where there was nothing in the certificate of title to
indicate any cloud or vice in the ownership of the property, or any encumbrance
thereon, the purchaser is not required to explore further than what the Torrens
Title upon its face indicates in quest for any hidden defect or inchoate right
that may subsequently defeat his right thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the rule were otherwise, the efficacy and conclusiveness of the
certificate of title which the Torrens System seeks to insure would entirely be
futile and nugatory.' (<span class="SpellE">Fule</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Legare</span>,
7 SCRA 351)." <span class="GramE">(pp. 18-19, Petitioner's Brief, p. 87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following rulings of this Court are additionally persuasive:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> where innocent third persons relying on the
correctness of the certificate of title issued, acquire rights over the
property, the court cannot disregard such rights and order the total
cancellation of the certificate for that would impair public confidence in the
certificate of title; otherwise everyone dealing with property registered under
the <span class="SpellE">torrens</span> system would have to inquire in every
instance as to whether the title had been regularly or irregularly issued by
the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this is contrary to
the evident purpose of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every
person dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the
certificate of title issued <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and the law will
in no way oblige him to go behind the certificate to determine the condition of
the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, an
innocent purchaser for value relying on a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">torrens</span></span>
title issued is protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A mortgagee
has the right to rely on what appears in the certificate of title and, in the
absence of anything to excite suspicion, he is under no obligation to look
beyond the certificate and investigate the title of the mortgagor appearing on
the face of said certificate." <span class="GramE">(Duran vs. IAC, 138 SCRA
489; Seno v. <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span>, 156 SCRA 113.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>In the case at bar, private respondents, in
good faith relied on the certificate of title in the name of Fe S. Duran and as
aptly stated by respondent appellate court ‘(even on the supposition that the
sale was void, the general rule that the direct result of a previous illegal
contract cannot be valid on the theory that the spring cannot rise higher than
its source) cannot apply here for we are confronted with the <span class="SpellE">functionings</span> of the Torrens System of Registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine to follow is simple enough:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a fraudulent or forged document of sale may
become the ROOT of a valid title if the certificate of title has already been
transferred from the name of the true owner to the name of the forger or the
name indicated by the forger.' <span class="GramE">'' (Duran vs. IAC, <u>supra</u>.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is very clear from section 55 of the Land Registration Act
that although an original owner of a registered land may seek the annulment of
a transfer thereof on the ground of fraud, such <span style="">a </span>remedy, however, is ‘without
prejudice to the rights of any innocent holder for value’ of the certificate of
title." (<st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Chanco</span>, 117 SCRA 201.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> When a mortgagee reli<span style="">e</span>s upon a Torrens title and loans money in all good faith on the
basis of the title standing in the name of the mortgagor, only thereafter to
discover one defendant to be an alleged forger and the other defendant to have
by his negligence or acquiescence made it possible for the fraud to transpire,
as between two innocent persons, the mortgagee and one of the mortgagors, the
latter who made the fraud possible by his act of confidence must bear the
loss." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Blondeau</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Nano</span>, et al., 61 SCRA 625.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We
are convinced that the issue alone that petitioners herein are purchasers in
good faith and for value sufficiently constitutes a bar to the complaint of
private respondents and there being enough proof to that effect, respondent
Judge should have dismissed the complaint of private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, We have read both the original
and the amended complaints of the private respondents and We cannot discern in
any of them any specific act indicating any participation of the petitioners in
whatever fraud might have attended the original transaction between the parents
of private respondents and J.Q. Wagner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city> vs. <span class="SpellE">Chanco</span>, 117 SCRA 201.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"The right or lien of an innocent mortgagee for value upon
the land mortgaged must be respected and protected, even if the mortgagor
obtained his title through fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remedy of the persons prejudiced is to bring an action for damages against
those who caused the fraud, and if the latter are insolvent, an action against
the Treasurer of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may be filed for recovery of damages against the Assurance Fund" (Blanco,
