MANILA, BRANCH VIII; ROLE, INC. AND ROMEO R. ECHAUZ, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The perfection of an appeal and the jurisdiction of a trial court
over a motion for execution pending appeal are the controverted issues in this
petition to review the order of the respondent court in Civil Case No. 82-7281,
dated December 16, 1986, denying the petitioner's motion for execution pending
appeal on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was filed on February 17, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents Role, Inc. and Romeo R.
Echauz filed their Comments on March 24 and March 27, 1987 respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner filed its Reply on June 16,
1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We treat </span>the Comments as the
respondents' Answers and decide the petition on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case has its origins in a complaint for the recovery of a
sum of money filed by petitioner Associated Bank against respondent ROLE,
Incorporated and Romeo R. Echauz before the then Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch 37.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 3, 1986, the trial court rendered its decision in
favor of the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">6, </span>1986, respondent ROLE filed its
notice of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 24, 1986,
respondent Echauz followed suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on November 19, 1986, the petitioner filed a motion
for execution pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 16, 1986, the respondent court issued the questioned
order denying the petitioner's motion for execution on the ground that the
notices of appeal seasonably filed by private respondents had already been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">given </span>due
course when he issued his previous orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the court, the filing of the respondents' notices of appeal
and its approval of those notices deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to
entertain the motion for execution pending appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i>
was filed to - (a) annul and set aside the order denying the petitioner's
motion for execution pending appeal;<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(b)
enjoin and prohibit the respondents, specifically the respondent court, from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">elevating the records of the case to the
Court of Appeals pending resolution of the instant petition; and (c) command
the respondent court to assume its jurisdiction and resolve the petitioner's
motion for execution pending appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned order is based on the premise that upon the
seasonable filing and approval of the respondents' notices of appeal, the trial
court is automatically divested of its jurisdiction over the case and,
consequently, it has no more power to act upon the petitioner's motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mistake is apparent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 39 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 removed the record on
appeal as a requirement for the per­fection of an appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In lieu of the usually expen­sive and
time-consuming record on appeal, the entire original records are now
transmitted to the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In implementation of this
amendatory provision, Section 23 of the Interim Rules of Court provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"23.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Perfection of appeal</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- In cases where appeal is taken, the
perfection of the appeal shall be upon the expiration of the last day to appeal
by any party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As long as any of the parties may still file his, her, or its appeal,
the court does not lose jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff or plaintiffs may not deprive the defendants or
co-plaintiffs and neither may the defendant or defendants deprive the plaintiff
or co-defendants of the right to file a motion for reconsideration or to move
for a new trial or an execution pending appeal by immediately filing a notice
of appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The filing of an appeal by a
losing party does not automatically divest the party favored by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>decision
of the right to move for a more favorable decision or to ask for execution
pending appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is only after all the
parties' respective periods to appeal have lapsed that the court loses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">its </span>jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span><u>Universal Far East Corporation </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">v. </span>Court of
Appeals</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(131 SCRA 642) the period
when a court considers and acts upon a motion for execution may take some
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, the

</span>motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">may
take </span>place long after the expiration of the regle­mentary fifteen-day
period for appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1934, this Court in <u>People </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">v. </span>Ursua</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(60 </span>Phil.
252) stressed this mode of determining when an appeal is perfected.</p>

<p class="BODY">An appeal by the defendant in a criminal case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">does </span>not result in the court's losing
its jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>entertain a
motion for reconsideration filed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
</span>offended party, insofar as civil liability is concerned, within the
15-day period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus we held in <u>Ursua</u>:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>x x x "If the accused has the right
within fifteen days to appeal from the judgment of conviction, the offended party
should have the right within the same period to appeal from so much of the
judgment as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is
</span>prejudicial to him, and his appeal should not be made dependent on that
of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If upon appeal by the
accused the court altogether loses its jurisdiction over the cause, the
offended party would be deprived of his right to appeal, although fifteen days
have not yet elapsed from the date of the judgment, if the accused files his
appeal before the expiration of said period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, if the court, independently of the appeal of the accused, has
jurisdiction, within fifteen days from the date of the judgment, to allow the
appeal of the offended party, it also has jurisdiction to pass upon the motion
for reconsideration filed by the private prosecution in connection with the
civil liabi­lity of the accused." (at pp. 254?255).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above ruling was reiterated in <u>Simsim v. Belmonte</u> (34
SCRA 536) where we stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Timoteo Simsim balked at the order to amend the record on
appeal, contending that it was beyond the power of the Court to issue once his
appeal had been perfected by the approval of the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x x

the parties, by the simple expedient of immediately perfecting his appeal, to
deprive the other party of the right to ask for a reconsideration of the

is denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These consequences find no
