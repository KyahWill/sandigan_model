				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition at
bar is an offshoot of two earlier cases decided by this Court on June 27, 1988,
involving substantially the same controversy and the same parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">These prior cases were G.R. Nos. 75271-73, entitled "<span class="SpellE"><i>Catalino</i></span><i> N. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
and 71 other striking workers of Asian Transmission Corporation v. Hon. Judge
Orlando R. <span class="SpellE">Tuico</span>, etc., et al.,</i>" and G.R.
No. 77567 entitled "<i>Asian Transmission Corporation (ATC) v. NLRC</i>."
Two basic questions were presented, one of which was whether or not a
return-to-work order may be validly issued by the National Labor Relations
Commission pending determination of the legality of the strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The directive in question reaffirmed a
return-to-work order first issued by the Ministry of Labor and Employment on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1986</st1:date>, reiterated on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1986</st1:date> and again on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue was resolved in the affirmative by the Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court devoting some words to the real reason for authorizing a return to
work pending resolution of a labor dispute, <span class="SpellE"><i>viz</i></span><i>:</i></p>

<blockquote>It is also important to emphasize that the return-to-work order not
so much confers a right as it imposes a duty; and while as a right it may be
waived, it must be discharged as a duty even against the worker's will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Returning to work in this situation is not a
matter of option or <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> but of
obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The worker must return to
his job together with his co-workers so the operations of the company can be
resumed and it can continue serving the public and promoting its interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the real reason such return can be
compelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So imperative is the order in
fact that it is not even considered <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the
right against involuntary servitude, as this Court held in <span class="SpellE"><i>Kaisahan</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Kahoy</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gotamco</span> Sawmills</i> (80 Phil. 521).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The worker can of course give up his work,
thus severing his ties with the company, if he does not want to obey the order;
but the order must be obeyed if he wants to retain his work even if his
inclination is to strike."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court also observed that the return-to-work order of June 3,
1986 was not only ignored but was defied by forty-four (44) employees who,
despite notice thereof, staged a strike and engaged in picketing; and it was
for this reason that when compliance with the return-to-work directive was
sought by those employees, the employer refused to accept them back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, despite still another return-to-work
order contained in the <i>Resolution of the respondent Commission dated </i><st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="1"><i>January 13, 1987</i></st1:date><i>,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
pertinently reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>" * *.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that
the petitioner (ATC) despite the order dated 24 November 1986 of the Acting
Minister 'to accept all the returning workers,’ continues to defy the directive
insofar as 44 of the workers are concerned, the Commission, sitting <i>en</i> <i>banc</i>,
resolved to order the petitioner to accept the said workers, or to reinstate
them on payroll immediately upon receipt of the resolution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court held the employer's refusal to be justified.</p>

<blockquote>"While the ATC has manifested its willingness to accept most
of the workers, and has in fact already done so, it has balked at the demand of
the remaining workers to be also allowed to return to work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its reason is that these persons, instead of
complying with the return-to-work order, as most of the workers have done,
insisted on staging the restrained strike and defiantly picketed the company
premises to prevent the resumption of operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By so doing, the ATC submits, these strikers
have forfeited their right to be readmitted, having abandoned their positions,
and so could be validly replaced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court agrees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The records show that the return-to-work order was first issued on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1986</st1:date>, and was reiterated on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The strike was declared thereafter, if we go
by the criminal complaints in G.R. Nos. 75271-73, where the alleged acts are
claimed to have been done on <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="6">June 9,
 1986</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These dates are not denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the petitioners argue in their
pleadings that they were engaged only in peaceful picketing, which would
signify that they had not on those dates returned to work as required and had
decided instead to ignore the said order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By their own acts, they are deemed to have abandoned their employment
and cannot now demand the right to return thereto by virtue of the very order
they have defied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accordingly, the Court holds that the return-to-work order should
benefit only those workers who complied therewith and, regardless of the
outcome of the compulsory arbitration proceedings, are entitled to be paid for
work they have actually performed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conversely, those workers who refused to obey the said order and instead
waged the restrained strike are not entitled to be paid for work not done or to
reinstatement to the positions they have abandoned by their refusal to return
thereto as ordered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The holding was reaffirmed in this Court's Resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1989</st1:date> which resolved <i>inter</i>
<span class="SpellE"><i>alia</i></span> the motion for reconsideration filed by
the workers affected (G.R. Nos. 75271-73).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Resolution stressed that ?</p>

<blockquote>"The NLRC had the authority to issue the return-to-work order,
subject to sanctions for non-compliance therewith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can impose such sanctions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those strikers who defied the order and
refused to return to work as required cannot now complain if they are deemed to
have forfeited their employment as a consequence of their intransigence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>* * ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On remand of the case to the NLRC, the <span class="SpellE">Bisig</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> Asian Transmission Labor Union (BATLU) filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1989</st1:date> a motion for execution
in behalf of the workers seeking readmission, whose number had been reduced to
thirty-four (34) by this time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Union
prayed that -- in line with the NLRC Resolution of January 13, 1987, which they
implied had been upheld by this Court -- they be reinstated, actually or
"on payroll pending the computation of their back wages and other fringe
benefits from the time * * (they) offered * * to return to work."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC (Third Division) granted the motion, by Resolution dated
<st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1989</st1:date>, justifying
its action as follows:</p>

<blockquote>" * *.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Firstly, the Supreme Court * * affirmed Our resolution of 13 January
1987, which clearly underscored that the return-to-work was issued even pending
the determination of the legality or illegality of the strike; secondly, the
decision of the Supreme Court dated 27 June 1988 as well as its Resolution of
22 February 1989 held that the return-to-work order should inure to the benefit
of those who comply therewith, and regardless of the result or outcome of the
compulsory arbitration proceedings (???); and thirdly, the grant of the motion
for execution is in consonance with the essence of a return-to-work as
expounded by the Supreme Court * *.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, were <span class="GramE">We</span>
to deny this motion for execution it would practically emasculate the very
import and objective of a return-to-work order and thus inevitably lead to
untold sufferings to the workers as well as losses to the company pending final
resolution of their dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where
national interest is at stake, the implementation of a return-to-work order
must not be subject to a <u>selective basis</u> by the company -- who are to be
readmitted or not, as in this case where 34 workers out of the 44 ordered to be
accepted by the company, or reinstated on payroll, are still left out in the
cold."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This Resolution is what the petitioner
ATC would have this Court annul and perpetually restrain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner would also have Us require
"respondents to show cause why they should not be cited for contempt for
subverting or violating the Supreme Court's decision (promulgated June 27,
1988) and resolution (dated February 22, 1989) in G.R. No. 75271-73 and No.
77567."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's submittals have merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writs prayed for will issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to see how this Court's
decision and its subsequent resolution on the motion for reconsideration in
G.R. Nos. 75271-73 and 77567 could be <span class="GramE">misread</span> by both
the public and the private respondents as upholding or affirming the claim to
reinstatement of the petitioner's forty-four (44) employees who had staged a
strike in defiance of the return-to-work order of <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">True said decision held valid the questioned NLRC resolutions of <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1987</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1987</st1:date> reaffirming the
order of <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1986</st1:date>
of the Acting Minister of Labor "to accept all returning workers."
But it did so subject to an important and explicitly stated qualification; said
orders were affirmed"* * <u>as above interpreted</u>,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
the clear and unmistakable reference in the quoted phrase being to the
pronouncements made in the body of the decision on the implications and
consequences of a return-to-work order -- specifically, the return-to-work
order of June 3, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that subject, the Court's decision, after finding that on the
record the forty-four workers involved had declared a strike and, in fact,
admitted to having engaged in picketing <u>after</u> the issuance of said
return-to-work order and its reiteration on June 13, 1986, declared in no
uncertain terms that the benefit of <span class="SpellE">readmittance</span> and
payment for work performed applied only to the workers who complied with the
order, not to those who refused to obey it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing can more clearly reveal what was in the mind of the Court and
the correct thrust of its ruling than this passage earlier quoted from its
decision which, for that reason, bears repeating:</p>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the Court holds that
the return-to-work order should benefit only those workers who complied
therewith and, regardless of the outcome of the compulsory arbitration
proceedings, are entitled to be paid for work they have actually
performed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, those workers who
refused to obey the said order and instead waged the restrained strike are not
entitled to be paid for work not done or to reinstatement to the positions they
have abandoned by their refusal to return thereto as ordered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That disposition came as but a logical consequence of the Court's
pronouncement stressing that the return-to-work order imposes a duty that must
be discharged more than it confers a right that may be waived, and that while
the worker may choose not to obey, he does so at the risk of severing his
relationship with his employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interpretation advocated by the respondents is warranted
neither by the plain language of the Court's decision nor by a sensible,
reasonable reading of its entire context.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The questioned NLRC resolution being wholly premised on such an
interpretation must be struck down as issued with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of this conclusion and there
appearing no compelling reason for a show-cause order, the petitioner's
additional plea for such an order is denied.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the NLRC Resolution of <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1989</st1:date> is ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Execution of this Court's decision in G.R.
Nos. 75271-73 and 77567 to effect or compel reinstatement by the petitioner of
the forty-four workers declared without right thereto in said decision, is
perpetually restrained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private respondents.</span></p>
