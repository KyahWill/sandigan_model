				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before <span class="GramE">Us</span> is the Motion of private
respondents for reconsideration of Our decision of <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1980</st1:date> which ordered the reinstatement
of petitioner with full backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the said motion for reconsideration, the following
were alleged:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was no clear denial of due process
because what the auditors did was merely to conduct a preliminary review of the
records to ascertain whether there were anomalies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon being informed by the au­ditors of the
anomalies involving the petitioner, <span style="">Mr.
</span>Benedicto <u>privately</u> confronted the petitioner about those
anomalies preparatory to a formal in­vestigation where he could be heard, but
instead of going through with the investigation, <span style="">the </span>petitioner agreed to avail of the company's retrench­ment
program going on at that time and collect, in connection therewith, <span style="">his </span>retirement benefits in full.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even assuming <u>arguendo</u> that there
"was denial of due process"<span class="GramE">,</span> petitioner's
severance from the company was nonetheless legal and proper because:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) being a managerial employee, <span style="">the </span>petitioner could be ter­minated
for mere lack of confidence and (b) the petitioner was legally retrenched.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We observe that no new matters were <span class="GramE">raised</span>
herein which would warrant a reconsideration, since the issues adduced above
were already considered and thoroughly discussed in the assailed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are no com­pelling reasons shown to
warrant disturbing the findings of the Labor Arbiter, and to merit <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> as prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="GramE">We</span> have previously pointed out, the
Commission failed to clearly establish by substantial evidence the involvement
of petitioner with the alleged anomalies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">A </span>mere generalized
statement "that the evidence collated by the team of auditors established
the involvement of Appellee [petitioner] in the above-said irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="">xxx</span></span><span style="">" will
not suffice to hold petitioner liable as charged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If petitioner voluntarily retired from the service, it would be
strange for him to thereafter file a com­plaint for illegal dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would be more con­sistent with normal
human behavior, if retirement was not forced upon him, <span style="">is </span>for him to have, at least, <span style="">expressed </span>some words of gratitude to private respondents,
considering that he had work with them for more than twenty (20) years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">the
motion for reconsideration is hereby denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
