Court (RTC) of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, Branch 131, acting as a
Special Criminal Court, finding Appellant, Norberto <span class="SpellE">Clores</span>
y Coral, guilty of Murder for the killing of Rodolfo Reyes y de Paz and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of </span><u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to
indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P30,000.00; and to pay the
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution evidence, as narrated in the appealed Decision
(pp. 1-2, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 14-15), discloses that on 24
December 1986, at about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
Escobar, the lone eyewitness in this case, was about to go home from a dancing
party held at <span class="SpellE">Zapote</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
178, <span class="SpellE">Camarin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City, when he saw, from a distance of about four (4) arms lengths, Appellant
and a certain <span class="SpellE">Jedy</span>, suddenly attack from behind and
stab Rodolfo Reyes, who at that time was standing beside the road preparing to
go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter had<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> given no provocation whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Clores</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jedy</span> took turns in stabbing the victim, with <span class="SpellE">Clores</span> using a bladed weapon about six (6) to eight (8)
inches long, while <span class="SpellE">Jedy</span> used a longer weapon about
twelve (12) to fourteen (14) inches in length, until the victim fell to the
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both weapons were not recovered
by the police from the crime scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
attacked, the victim was unable to shout or ask for help although he gave out a
scream before he expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only
after the assailants ha run away and after the victim had fallen flat on his
face that the incident caught the attention of other people who were still
loitering after the party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim
was immediately rushed to the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Quezon</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> City General</span></st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> where he was declared dead on arrival.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Escobar did not go to the hospital but
instead informed the victim's brother-in-law, who lived just in front of the
dance hall, of the tragedy.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter, Escobar accompanied the widow of the victim to a
police sub-station to report the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two policemen immediately proceeded to the scene of the crime and were
thereafter assisted by Escobar in locating the house of Appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter was found sleeping in his
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been identified by Escobar
as one of the assailants of the victim, Appellant was then taken to the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Police Station where he denied participation
in the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Witness Escobar and the
victim's widow, <span class="SpellE">Mylvin</span> Anson Reyes, gave their sworn
statements to the police.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">For his part, Appellant
narrated that on 23 December</span> 1986, at around 7:00 o'clock in the
evening, after having come from work, he was going home to Area D, <span class="SpellE">Camarin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City, when he
was accosted by a man whom he met for the first time and who introduced himself
as <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Escobar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter asked him for some money with which to buy two (2) cases of
beer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Escobar appeared to be drunk
at that time and because he was afraid that he might create trouble, Appellant
claimed that he gave him all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">money
in his pocket amounting to thirty five pesos </span>(P35.00).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he was walking home, he saw one of the
companions of Escobar challenging anyone for a fight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then saw Escobar engaged in a fistfight
with another man whom he did not recognize.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When he reached his residence, he prepared his supper and went to
bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="12">24 December 1986</st1:date>, he was awakened by police
officers and was taken to the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Police
Station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that he was asked to
identify <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the assailant of the victim, </span>but
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was unable to do so as he was not at
the crime scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was then informed
that he was implicated by Escobar as one of the assailants of the victim, which
he denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, the only
reason he could think of as to why he was implicated was his failure to give
Escobar the amount the latter was demanding (RTC Decision, pp. 2-3, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 15-16).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Trial Court gave more
credence to the prosecution version, attributed greater weight to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">testimony of lone prosecution witness, Escobar, which it found to be
logical, straightforward and more probable compared to the alibi and the
denials interposed by Appellant, and adjudged the latter guilty of Murder with
the qualifying circumstance of treachery.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Disagreeing with said
Decision, Appellant addresses this appeal to this Court, ascribing the
following errors below:</span></p>

<blockquote>"FIRST:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trial court gravely erred in giving much weight and credence to
the version of lone eye-witness Mr. <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Escobar;</blockquote>

<blockquote>SECOND:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trial court also erred in finding and considering the existence
of the qualifying circumstance of `treachery' in the instant case; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>THIRD:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trial court likewise erred in finding the herein accused-appellant
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense charged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">This appeal lacks
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the prosecution
presented only one eyewitness to the commission of the crime, <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Escobar, who pointed to Appellant as one of the
assailants of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
his testimony is uncorroborated, however, will not detract from its
credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no law which
requires that the testimony of a single witness has to be corroborated, except
where expressly mandated as in treason where the testimony of at least two
witnesses to the same overt act is needed (People vs. </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>G.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

credible and positive, is sufficient to support a conviction even in a charge for
Murder (People vs. De la Cruz, G.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">R.
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. L-71044-45, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">16 March

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">When it comes to the
matter of credibility of a witness, settled are the guiding rules some of which
are </span>that (1) the Appellate court will not disturb the factual findings
of the lower Court, unless there is a showing that it had overlooked,
misunderstood or misapplied same fact or circumstance of weight and substance
that would have affected the result of the case (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ablaza</span>,
G.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">R. </span>No. L-27352, 31 October
1969, 30 SCRA 173), which showing is absent herein; (2) the findings of the
Trial Court pertaining to the credibility of a witness is entitled to great
respect since it had the opportunity to examine his demeanor as he testified on
the witness stand, and, therefore, can discern if such witness is telling the
truth or not (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Amoncio</span>, G.R. No. L-49069, <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="6">22 June 1983</st1:date>, 122 SCRA 686) and (3) a
witness who testifies in a c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ategorical,
straightforward, spontaneous and frank manner and remains consistent on
cross-examination is a credible witness </span>(People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">vs. <span class="SpellE">Barros</span>, G.R. No. L-34249, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">3 May
 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 122 SCRA 34).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Trial Court described
Escobar's testimony as "logical, straight-forward and more probable"
and not "in any manner shaken by cross-examination to which he was
exposed" (RTC Decision, p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
18).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have found no reason to overturn
that finding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Escobar's testimony
faithfully re-states the sworn declaration he gave to the police authorities on
</span><st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="12">24 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 11.0pt">December 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,
a few hours after the incident transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was one of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanods</span>
of the area (TSN, 13 April 1987, p. 7), concerned with peace and order </span>in
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the community.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was about four (4) arms lengths away from
the actual occurrence and saw Appellant stab the victim once "on the upper
right, above the buttocks." This coincides with the medical certificate
which indicated the location of one of the stab </span>wounds as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on the "trunk" (Exhibit
"A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had known Appellant
for about a month before the incident and the place where he was residing which
he described </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">near the house
of the victim, and could not have been mistaken in his identification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had also known the other assailant
"Jed" for about two weeks before the incident and saw him stab the
victim once.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">There can be </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">question either about Appellant's
identification as one of the assailants by Escobar during both his direct and
cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that
positive identification of an accused by a credible witness demonstrates his
culpability (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sabater</span>, G.R. No. L-38169, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">23
 February 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 81
SCRA 564).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears stressing that
Appellant was identified by witness Escobar not only during the trial, but
immediately after the commission of the crime before the investigating police
officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The early identification of appellant
by a prosecution witness bespeaks of his spontaneity </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">veracity (People vs. Chavez, G.R. No.
L-38603, </span><st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">30 September 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 117 SCRA 221).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant, in denying his
participation in the crime, resorted to alibi and claimed that he was sleeping
at the house where he was staying after coming from work at the time of the
incident in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is
the rule that alibi is generally a weak defense since it is easy to concoct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, it is viewed with caution
and is accepted only when proved by positive, clear and satisfactory
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For alibi to prosper, it is
not enough to prove that the person accused of a crime was somewhere when the
crime was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must likewise be
demonstrated that it was physically impossible for him to have been at the
scene of the crime at that time (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Candado</span>, </span>G.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">R. No. L-34089, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1 August 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 84 SCRA 508).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Trial Court, the distance
between Appellant's place of residence and the scene of the crime was barely
one-half kilometer (RTC Decision, p. 6, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">p. 19), hence, Appellant's posture
cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Positive
identification of the accused is more credible than </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">denials and alibis, which were not
established by full, clear and satisfactory evidence" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Candado</span>, <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing could be more settled then that alibi cannot prevail over the
positive identification made by a prosecution witness.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Besides, Appellant had
involved himself in contradictions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
said that it was around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="19"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">7:00 P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> when he saw Escobar on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">23
 December 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> after
having come from work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But when asked
for his working hours, he answered that they worked half day </span>up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="13"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1:00 P.M.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> that day because of the yuletide season
(TSN, </span>5 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November 1989, pp. </span>3
&amp; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also highly improbable that Escobar,
whom he admittedly did not know, would demand money from </span>him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">impression
that Appellant wanted to convey by his testimony was that Escobar was the
culprit as he saw the latter engaged in a fistfight with an unidentified
man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this were the truth, he could
have disclosed his impression during the police interrogation; however, all he
declared then was that he did not know the culprit as he was not at the crime
scene.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant's submission
likewise is that witness Escobar testified against him because he did not give
him the amount he was demanding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to Appellant, this tarnished the witness’ credibility and
showed his bias (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 28).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the fact that Escobar denied
having approached Appellant and demanded money from him, this circumstance
alone would not be a convincing motive for witness Escobar to falsely implicate
Appellant in such a heinous crime as Murder.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant further alleges
that witness Escobar's testimony is also discredited by his inaction and failure
to call for help and pursue the assailants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, </span>an eyewitness <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">t</span>o a crime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">like Murder cannot normally be expected to immediately respond to the
victim or summon assistance, much less pursue the criminals who are armed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, the natural
instinct of self-preservation would prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, Escobar directed his attention more at informing the family </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the victim and reporting the incident
to the police.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Appellant makes capital
of the fact that the physician who examined the cadaver of the victim was not
presented </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the possible relative positions of the
victim and assailants could not be determined which also raised doubts as to
who between <span class="SpellE">Clores</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jedy</span>
actually inflicted the stab wounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
fact remains, however, that from the evidence adduced, each of them had stabbed
the victim once (TSN, 15 July 1987, p. 11).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the face of
positive identification of the Appellant, the kind of weapon used, as well as
the location of the stab wounds, assume secondary importance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notably also, the medical certificate
presented </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">evidence was
authenticated and admitted </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
lower Court (Exhibit "1", TSN, 9 October 1987, p. 5; 6 November 1987,
p. 4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the matter of the
existence of treachery, Appellant claims that from the unsubstantiated medical
evidence, it appears that the victim sustained stab wounds in the trunk and
chest, hence, the attack was frontal and negates the presence of
treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "trunk",
however, is, in fact, at the back of an individual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As categorically stated by witness Escobar in
his testimony, he saw Appellant stab the victim above the buttocks, proving in
fact, that he was stabbed from behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The stab wound on the chest must have been that inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Jedy</span>, the other assailant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">But even assuming that
the attack was frontal, as suggested by Appellant, there could still be
treachery if the attack was suddenly made, as the evidence in this case
indicates (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Acabado</span>, G.R. No. L-26104, </span><st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">31
 January 1969</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, 26
SCRA 727), on an unarmed and helpless victim who was given no chance whatsoever
to defend himself from the fatal blows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The requisites that the law requires for a finding of treachery have
thus been established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Finally, appellant claims
that because of the conflicting versions of the prosecution and the defense,
motive is important in determining the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to him, there was no motive for him to kill the victim (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 32-33).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Motive, however, need not be established where the appellant has been
positively identified and there is no doubt as to the identity of the culprit,
as in the case at bar (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Demeterio</span>, G.R. No.
