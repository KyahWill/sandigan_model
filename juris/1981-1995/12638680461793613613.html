questioning the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> dated <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date> of the Commission on
Audit which disallowed in audit <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Miranda’s
claim for payment of his salary as City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>
City during the period of <span style="">his </span>suspension
from <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record that sometime in 1977, Engineer <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> Miranda, City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>
City, was administratively charged with (1) <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> funds; (2) overpricing of hand tools for <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> roads; (3) refusal to cooperate with local
officials in the prosecution of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> projects;
and (4) electioneering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a telegram
dated <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1978</st1:date> then
President Marcos, thru Executive Secretary Juan <span class="SpellE">Tuvera</span>,
ordered the suspension of Engineer Miranda pending the investigation of the
aforesaid charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Engineer Pedro <span class="SpellE">Acedillo</span> was designated by then President Marcos as acting
City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City vice Engineer
Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A committee, headed by Colonel <span class="SpellE">Manalang</span>, to conduct an investigation was created by
Admiral <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espaldon</span>
pursuant to the directive of then President Marcos.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1986</st1:date>,
upon the recommendation of then Minister <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
Mercado of the Ministry (now Department) of Public Works and Highways,
Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo by authority of the President, lifted the
preventive suspension of Engineer Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1986</st1:date>,
Engineer Miranda re-assumed his position as City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1986</st1:date>,
<span style="">Minister </span>Mercado issued a
resolution dropping for lack of evidence the administrative case against
Engineer Miranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">As payment of Engineer Miranda’s claim for back salaries, <span class="SpellE">medicare</span> contribution, life and retirement insurance
premiums for the period <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1986</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglungsod</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
appropriated the sum of P252,539.00 from the Infrastructure Fund of the
city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Office of the
Department of Budget and Management approved the appropriation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, on November 21, 1986
disbursement voucher No. 211-8611 in the amount of P210,630.00 was prepared
covering the back salaries of Engineer Miranda from June 1, 1978 to May 21,
1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, instead of giving due
course to the claim of Engineer Miranda the City Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span>
City forwarded the matter to the Commission on Audit Regional Director for a
ruling.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1987</st1:date>,
the COA Regional Office disallowed the claims of Engineer Miranda on the ground
that the order lifting the suspension did not specify that he is entitled to
payment of back salaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Carpenter <span class="SpellE">Arpa</span> II, Officer-in­-Charge, Commission on Audit, Region
IX, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City also opined that payment of back
salaries to a government officer or employee is allowed only if he is
exonerated of the charge against him and his suspension or dismissal is
declared illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Engineer Miranda elevated the matter to the public respondent
COA, but the latter sustained in its decision dated June 20, 1988, the
disallowance in audit of the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span> claim for
payment of his salary as City Engineer during the period of his suspension from
June 1, 1978 to May 21, 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for resolution is whether or not the public
respondent gravely abused its discretion when it disallowed in audit Engineer
Miranda’s claim for payment of his salary as City Engineer during the period of
his suspension from <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1978</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Miranda contends that he is entitled to back salaries
because under Section 35 of the Manual of Administrative Investigation, if an
Officer or Employee is exonerated of the <span style="">administrative case he is restored to his position with full payment of
his salaries during the period of suspension.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He likewise argues </span><span style="">that upon the reinstatement an illegally suspended
employee is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, public respondent COA, thru the Solicitor
General, opines that petitioner Miranda cannot invoke Section 35 of <span style="">the Manual of
Administrative Investigation because he was not exonerated of the charges </span><span style="">against him as the case was dropped and
considered closed without any findings of his guilt or innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General also </span><span style="">argues that during the period of suspension
no salary shall be paid unless so provided in the order of suspension and
pointed out that payment of the salary withheld may be made at the discretion
of the suspending officer if the suspended employee is subsequently reinstated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 35 of Republic Act No. 2260, otherwise known as the Civil
Service Act of 1959, provides:</p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 35. Lifting of Preventive Suspension, Pending Administrative
Investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- When the administrative
case against the officer or employee under preventive suspension is not finally
decided by the Commissioner of Civil Service within the period of sixty (60)
days after the date of suspension of the respondent, the respondent shall <span style="">be reinstated in the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the </span>respondent officer or employee
is exonerated, he shall be restored to his position with full pay for the
period <span style="">of suspension.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Section 42 of Presidential Decree No. 807 dated <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1975</st1:date>, declares:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“SEC. 42.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lifting of Preventive </span>Suspension
Pending Administrative Investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-
When the administrative case against the officer or employee <span style="">under preventive suspension is </span><span style="">not </span>finally decided by the
disciplining authority within the period of ninety (90) days after the date of
suspension of the respondent who is not a presidential appointee, the
respondent shall be automatically reinstated in the service:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That when the delay in the
disposition of the case is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the <span style="">respondent, the period of delay shall not be
counted in computing the period of suspension herein provided.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the earlier case of Garcia v. Executive Secretary (6 SCRA 1
[1962]), this Court had occasion to rule that the preventive suspension of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span> Garcia, the Chairman of the National Science
Development Board, whose preventive suspension lasted for nearly seven months
is illegal and void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>applying the
provisions of Section 35 of the Civil Service Act of 1959 to a Presidential
Appointee this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>“To adopt the theory of respondents that an officer appointed by
the President, facing administrative charges can be preventively suspended
indefinitely, would be to countenance a <span style="">situation
where the preventive suspension can, in effect, be the </span>penalty itself
without a finding of guilt after due hearing, contrary to the express mandate
of the Constitution (No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be
removed or suspended except for cause <span style="">as
</span>provided by law (Art. XII, Section 4, Constitution of the Philippines]
and the Civil Service Law (No officer or employee in the Civil Service shall be
removed or suspended except for cause as provided by law and <span style="">after due process).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ????? is believed, is not conducive to
the maintenance of a robust, effective and efficient civil service, the
integrity of which has, in this jurisdiction, received constitutional
guarantee, as it </span>places in the hands of the Chief Executive a weapon
that could be wielded to undermine the security of tenure of public
officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, this is not <span style="">so in the case of those officers holding
office at the pleasure of the President.” (at p. 8)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reiterating the Garcia doctrine, this Court in <span class="SpellE">Layno</span>, Sr. v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> (136
SCRA 536 [1985]) ruled that a preventive suspension may be justified but its
continuance for an unreasonable length of time is sheer oppression and a denial
of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even more recently in <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> (173 SCRA 409 [1989]) and <span class="SpellE">Doromal</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> (177 SCRA 354 [1989]), this Court
once again applied the Garcia doctrine and ruled that indefinite suspension of
a public official, whether elected or appointed, cannot be sanctioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reasonable period of suspension as provided
under Section 42 of Presidential Decree No. 807 should not exceed the ninety
(90) day period.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed in the case at bar that Engineer Miranda was
under preventive suspension from <st1:date year="1978" day="2" month="6">June
 2, 1978</st1:date> until it was lifted on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
suspension for almost eight <span style="">(8) </span>years
is unreasonable and unjustified as Section 42 of Presidential Decree No. 807,
the applicable law, mandates that preventive suspension should not be longer
than ninety (90) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dropping of
the administrative case against Engineer Miranda on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1986</st1:date>, for lack of evidence, is even an
eloquent manifestation that the suspension is unjustified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, Engineer Miranda is entitled
to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> during the period of his suspension as
it is already settled in this jurisdiction that a government official or
employee is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> not only if he is
exonerated in the administrative case but also when the suspension is
unjustified (<span class="SpellE">Abellera</span> v. City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
19 SCRA 600 [1967]); citing Reyes v. Hernandez, 71 Phil. 297; <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, G.R. No.
L-15945, <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1964</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="">regards
</span>the computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> we apply the
formula adopted in a long line of cases involving illegally dismissed civil
servants who were subsequently reinstated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justice and equity dictate that Engineer Miranda should be paid <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> equivalent to five (5) years pay at the rate last
received by him before his suspension on June 2, 1978, without qualification
and deduction (Gabriel v. Domingo et. al., G.R. No. 87420, September 17, 1990,
citing Rubio v. PHHC, G.R. No. L-31469, <st1:date year="1990" day="22" month="5">May
 <span style="">22, </span>1990</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Gementiza</span> v. CA, 113 SCRA 477 [1982]; <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Balquiedra</span></span><span style=""> v. </span>CFI of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, 80 SCRA 123 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, 78 SCRA 175 [1977]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision No. 532 dated <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date> of the respondent Commission on
