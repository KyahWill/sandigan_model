				<H3>ALEXANDER VAN TWEST AND THE HON. SALVADOR P. DE GUZMAN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MAKATI, BRANCH 142, PETITIONERS, VS. THE HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND GLORIA ANACLETO, RESPONDENTS.<BR><BR><U>DECISION</U></H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On 8 March 1990, petitioner Alexander Van Twest filed a complaint against private respondent Gloria Anacleto and International Corporate Bank ("Interbank") for recovery of a sum of money with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction, before Branch 142 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, where the action was docketed as Civil Case No. 90-659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Petitioner alleged in his complaint that in 1989, he and private respondent opened a joint foreign currency savings account with Interbank to hold funds which "belonged entirely and exclusively" to petitioner, to "facilitate the funding of certain business undertakings" of both of them and which funds were to be "temporarily (held) in trust" by private respondent, who "shall turnover the same to plaintiff upon demand." Petitioner further alleged that withdrawals from the account were always made through their joint signatures; that when his business relationship with private respondent turned sour, the latter unilaterally closed their joint account, withdrew the remaining balance of Deutschmark (DM) 269,777.37 and placed the money in her own personal account with the same bank.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Petitioner thus sought an injunctive writ to prevent private respondent from withdrawing the money at any time and thereby defeat petitioner's main and pending action in Civil Case No. 90-659.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After issuing a temporary restraining order upon the filing of the complaint, the trial court conducted hearings on four (4) successive session dates on the application for a writ of preliminary injunction, examining petitioner and his two (2) witnesses, as well as private respondent. The hearings culminated in the issuance of an order dated 28 March 1990, enjoining private respondent and Interbank from effecting and allowing withdrawals from the foreign currency deposit account until further orders from the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The preliminary injunction order of the Regional Trial Court was, however, annulled on petition for certiorari filed by private respondent before the Court of Appeals in a Decision dated 19 July 1991.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having been denied by the Court of Appeals, he is now before this Court on Petition for Review, seeking reinstatement of the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated 12 August 1992, the Court motu proprio issued an indefinite temporary restraining order enjoining the Court of Appeals from enforcing its questioned Decision and Resolution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The parties subsequently complied with the requirement of the Court to submit responsive pleadings in amplification of their respective positions regarding the soundness of the Court of Appeals' Decision under review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The Court then resolved to give due course to the Petition and required the parties to submit their memoranda. The parties did.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Deliberating on the present Petition for Review, the Court considers that the Court of Appeals was in reversible error in annulling the writ of preliminary injunction issued in petitioner's favor by the Regional Trial Court.<br><br>In ruling that petitioner was not entitled to the provisional remedy of preliminary injunction during the pendency of Civil Case No. 90-659, the Court of Appeals said:<br><blockquote>"Upon the facts of the complaint filed, we rule that the writ of preliminary injunction issued by the lower court is improper and without basis. It is clear from the complaint that the subject foreign currency was deposited in a savings account under the name of private respondent (herein petitioner) 'and/or' herein petitioner (now private respondent). By virtue of this 'and/or' agreement, petitioner is authorized to withdraw from the account on the strength of her signature alone. The allegation of private respondent that the said foreign currency solely belonged to him loses its meaning in the face of the fact that the amount was deposited in a joint fund and had become, under the eyes of the law, property jointly owned by petitioner and private respondent. Furthermore, by private respondent's own admission, said foreign currency deposit was to be used to fund the business venture of private respondent and petitioner. The evidence on record shows that petitioner was going to withdraw the subject foreign currency deposit so that it may be used as collateral for a peso loan, which, in turn, would be used to pay-off the obligations incurred by both petitioner and private respondent in the course of their business venture. In fact, an action to collect the amount of P2,998,500.00 representing the unpaid obligation of private respondent and petitioner to one of their creditors, had been filed in the Regional Trial Court of Makati on 29 March 1990.<br><br><u>In short, private respondent had failed to show that he has a right to stop petitioner from withdrawing the foreign currency deposit under their joint 'and/or' account. And it was error for respondent Judge to have issued the Order dated 29 March 1990 granting the writ of preliminary injunction.</u>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Petitioner's principal contention is that the public respondent misappreciated the facts of the case; he did not seek injunction to restrain private respondent from withdrawing the funds from their joint account, since private respondent indeed enjoyed a semblance of right to do so and the withdrawal had already become a <u>fait accompli</u>. Rather, petitioner seeks to restrain private respondent from effecting withdrawals from her <u>personal</u> account, <u>into which she had transferred the foreign currency</u>, in order not to defeat his main action seeking recovery of said fund.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The Court must agree with petitioner. The Court of Appeals evidently misapprehended the facts of this case, a relatively exceptional situation warranting the Court to rule on factual issues in a petition for review, preparatory to the resolution of the legal issues posed in this proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>It would be untenable for petitioner to try and restrain private respondent from withdrawing money from their joint account, an accomplished fact which can no longer be enjoined.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Petitioner, and the trial court, correctly directed the writ applied for against private respondent's personal savings account because the object of the writ is to preserve the <u>status quo</u>, the last, actual, peaceable and uncontested status that preceeded the pending controversy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> An injunctive writ would prevent private respondent from withdrawing from her personal account at will, or at least without the prior knowledge and consent of the trial court and petitioner, thereby approximating the situation obtaining when the money subject of the main action was previously deposited in a joint savings account, as well as ensuring that the continuation of petitioner's main suit for recovery of the sum of money would be worthwhile.<br><br>There is also a more fundamental reason why issuance of an injunctive writ was warranted in this case. The record of the preliminary hearings conducted by the trial court on the application for a writ of injunction indicates that petitioner had shown a clear legal right over the fund, notwithstanding the circumstance that the foreign currency was initially placed in a joint savings account, such that petitioner's right must be protected from the prospective acts of the private respondent, following the fund's transfer to her personal account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>First, as found by the Court of Appeals, private respondent intended to use the Deutschmarks as collateral for a peso loan which she would use to pay-off the debts incurred by her faltering joint venture with petitioner. It should be noted that private respondent's declared object <u>does not</u> articulate a claim of <u>ownership</u> over the foreign exchange funds.<br><br>Second, although private respondent specifically denied in her answer petitioner's averment in his complaint that the money is owned by him,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> she did make an affirmative allegation in her answer that petitioner "agreed to <u>finance</u> the project."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> One cannot finance a project without owning the funds with which the financing is to be undertaken. She also declared, in her testimony during the preliminary hearings on petitioner's application for a writ of preliminary injunction, that petitioner undertook to remit his cash investment in her name and that she was the industrial partner in the joint venture:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="center">"x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">(Atty.

It does not appear indubitable that private respondent was a co-owner of the funds who could unilaterally control the application thereof in payment of partnership debts. Indeed, petitioner has affirmatively shown that the Deutschmarks originated from him alone and that he alone was owner thereof. By depositing those funds in a joint 'and/or' account, petitioner did not convey ownership thereof to private respondent and private respondent could not convert those funds to her personal and exclusive ownership and use.<br><br>We believe and so hold that the trial court did not act with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the injunctive writ and that the Court of Appeals committed reversible error in concluding otherwise; private respondent was heard and had exhaustively presented all her arguments in opposition to the writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>In a bid to buttress the Decision of the Court of Appeals, private respondent contends for the first time in this proceeding that the personal foreign currency deposit account she is maintaining is exempt from processes issued by the courts, pursuant to Section 8 of R.A. 6426 as amended by P.D. 1246, the statute in force on 26 February 1990, the date she withdrew the foreign exchange fund from her joint account with petitioner and transferred the same to her personal account.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> Private respondent adds that the Court has plenary authority to disregard the procedural defect attending private respondent's new contention; since this case cannot be resolved adequately without a ruling on the nature of the exemption from court processes granted by the statute.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Private respondent's contentions do not persuade. Her belated invocation of the provisions of R.A. No. 6426 as amended violates basic procedural due process by interposing a new matter before this Court the consideration of which would further delay a final disposition on the propriety of petitioner's application for an injunctive writ.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>On a substantive level, the Court holds that the privileges extended by the statute cited by private respondent are actually enjoyed, and are invocable only, by the petitioner, both because private respondent's transactions fall outside the ambit of the statute, and because petitioner <u>is</u> the owner of the foreign exchange fund subject of this case. This conclusion is anchored on the consistent and contemporaneous administrative construction by the Central Bank of the basic statute, as manifested in the relevant circulars issued by it in implementation of that law, which are entitled to great respect by the courts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Section 8 of R.A. No. 6426 (the Foreign Currency Deposit Act), as amended by P.D. No. 1246, which is still in force, provides:<br><blockquote>"Sec. 8. <u>Secrecy of Foreign Currency Deposits</u> -- All foreign currency deposits authorized under this Act, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1035, as well as foreign currency deposits authorized under Presidential Decree No. 1034, are hereby declared as and considered of an absolutely confidential nature and, <u>except upon the written permission of the depositor</u>, in no instance shall such foreign currency deposits be examined, inquired or looked into by any person, government official, bureau or office, whether judicial or administrative or legislative or any other entity whether public or private: <u>Provided, however, that said foreign currency shall be exempt from attachment, garnishment, or any other order or process of any court, legislative body, government agency or any administrative body whatsoever</u>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> (Underscoring supplied)<br></blockquote>Section one hundred-two of Circular No. 960, Series of 1983, provides in relevant part:<br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">"x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Sec. 102. <u>Foreign currency funds ineligible for deposits</u>.<br><br><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">a. </div></td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">Foreign exchange purchased from authorized agent banks in accordance with existing regulations such as excess travel funds; unspent financial assistance of dependents abroad of Philippine residents; foreign exchange acquired from any resident persons, firm, association and corporation; <u>and transfers to a foreign currency deposit account or receipt from another foreign currency deposit account, whether for payment of legitimate obligation or otherwise, are not eligible for deposit under the System</u>.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br></div>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>This Circular was in force at the time private respondent undertook her questioned transactions; thus, such local transfer from the original joint foreign currency account to another (personal) foreign currency account, was not an eligible foreign currency deposit within the coverage of R.A.

No. 6426.<br><br>Circular No. 960 was superseded by Circular No. 1318, Series of 1992, which did <u>not</u> reenact and continue the administrative provision above-mentioned (Section 102). Nevertheless, Section seventy-four, Chapter seven of Circular No. 1318, which deals with the foreign currency deposit system, provides in relevant part:<br><blockquote>"Section 74. <u>Definition of Terms</u>.
