JUSTICE FRANCIS GARCHITORENA, SANDIGANBAYAN (FIRST DIVISION) AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, RESPONDENTS.

				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This is a petition for certiorari
under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court to set aside:  (a) the Resolution dated March 3, 1993 in
Criminal Case No. 16698 of the Sandiganbayan (First Division) and to declare
Presiding Justice Francis Garchitorena of the Sandiganbayan, disqualified from
acting in said criminal case; and (b) the Resolution of said court promulgated
on March 14, 1993, which deemed as "filed" the 32 Amended
Informations against petitioner (Rollo, pp. 2-35 and pp. 36-94).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 1, 1991, petitioner was charged in Criminal Case No. 16698
of the Sandiganbayan with violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>amended, otherwise known <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, allegedly committed by her favoring "unqualified"
aliens with the benefits of the Alien Legalization Program (Rollo, p. 36).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 24, 1991, petitioner filed with us a petition for certiorari
and prohibition, docketed as G.R. No. 99289-­99290 (Santiago v. Vasquez, 205
SCRA 162 [1992]), to enjoin the Sandiganbayan from proceeding with Criminal
Case No. 16698 on the ground that said case was intended solely to harass her
as she was then a presidential candidate.  She alleged that this was in violation of Section 10, Article IX-C of
the Constitution which provides that "<u>(b)ona fide</u> candidates for
any public office shall be free from any form of harassment and
discrimination." The petition was dismissed on January 13, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1992, petitioner filed a motion for inhibition of
Presiding Justice Garchitorena, which motion was set for hearing on November
13, 1992 at 8:00 A.M.  (Rollo, pp.
38-41).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On October 27, 1992, the
Sandiganbayan (First Division), of which Presiding Justice Garchitorena is a
member, set the criminal case for arraignment on November 13, 1992 at 8:00
A.M.  (Rollo, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">p. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">42)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 6, 1992, petitioner moved to defer the arraignment on
the grounds that there was a pending motion for inhibition, and that petitioner
intended to file a motion for a bill of particulars (Rollo, pp. 43-44).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 9, 1992, the Sandiganbayan (First Division) denied
the motion to defer the arraignment (Rollo, p. 45).</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 10, 1992, petitioner filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>motion for a bill of particulars (Rollo, pp. 47-48).  The motion stated that while the information
alleged that petitioner had approved the application for legalization of
"aliens" and gave them indirect benefits and advantages it lacked a
list of the favored aliens.  According
to petitioner, unless she was furnished with the names and identities of the
aliens, she could not properly plead and prepare for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1992 and upon motion of petitioner in G.R. No.
107598 (Miriam Defensor Santiago v. Sandiganbayan, et al.), we directed the
Sandiganbayan (First Division) to reset the arraignment to a later date and to
dispose of the two incidents pending before it (Re: disqualification of
Presiding Justice Garchitorena and the motion for bill of particulars).</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on November 13, 1992 on the motion for a bill of
particulars, the prosecution stated categorically that they would file only one
amended information against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on December 8, 1992, the prosecution filed a motion to
admit the 32 Amended Informations (Criminal Cases Nos. 18371 to 18402; Rollo,
pp. 61-126).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1993, Presiding Justice Garchitorena issued the
questioned Resolution dated March 11, 1993, denying the motion for his
disqualification (Rollo, pp. 151-164).</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 14, 1993, the Sandiganbayan (First Division) promulgated
a resolution, admitting the 32 Amended Informations and ordering petitioner to
post the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">corresponding bail bonds
within ten days from notice (Rollo, pp. 165-185).  Petitioner's arraignment on the 32 Amended Informations was set
for April 12, 1993 at 8:00 A.M.  (Rollo,
p. 186).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, the filing of the
instant petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Acting on the petition
for the issuance of a restraining order, we issued the Resolution dated March
25, 1993, ordering Presiding Justice Garchitorena "to CEASE and DESIST
from sitting in the case until the question of his disqualification is finally
resolved by this Court and from enforcing the resolution dated March 11, 1993,
ordering petitioner to post bail bonds for the 32 Amended Informations and from
proceeding with the arraignment on April 12, 1993" (Rollo, p. 194).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:25.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:normal">Re:  </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;font-weight:normal">Dis</span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;font-weight:normal">qualification of the Sandiganbayan Presiding Justice</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for the disqualification of Presiding Justice
Garchitorena is based on the publication of his letter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>the July 29, 1992 issue of the <u>Philippine Star</u>, which
to petitioner "prejudged" the validity of the information filed
against her.  Petitioner claims that
Presiding Justice Garchitorena "cannot be expected to change the
conclusions he has subconsciously drawn in his public statements x x x when he
sits in judgment on the merits of the case x x x" (Rollo, pp. 16-17).</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter in question was written in response to an item in
Teodoro Benigno's column in the July 22, 1992 issue of the <u>Philippine Star</u>,
criticizing the Sandiganbayan for issuing on July 11, 1992 a hold-departure
order against petitioner.  Benigno wrote
that said order reflected a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"perverse
morality" of the Sandiganbayan and the lack of "legal morality"
of its Presiding Justice, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I cannot, for example accept the legal morality of
Sandiganbayan Justice Francis Garchitorena who would stop Miriam Defensor
Santiago from going abroad for a Harvard scholarship because of graft charges
against her.  Some of the most
perfidious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Filipinos </span>I know have
come and gone, left and returned to these shores without Mr. Garchitorena
kicking any kind of rumpus.  Compared to
the peccadilloes of this country's outstanding felons, what Miriam is accused
of is kindergarten stuff.  The
Sandiganbayan Supremo got a lot of headlines for stopping Miriam but I contend
this is the kind of perverse morality we can do without" (Rollo, p. 156).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The portion of the letter of Presiding Justice Garchitorena,
which petitioner finds objectionable, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(c) Mrs. Santiago has never informed any court where her
cases are pending of her intention to travel, whether the Regional Trial Court
where she is charged with soliciting donations from people transacting with her
office at Immigration or before the Sandiganbayan where she is charged with
having favored unqualified aliens with the benefits of the Alien Legalization
Program nor even the Supreme Court where her petition is still pending"
(Rollo, p. 158).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In particular, petitioner considered as prejudgment the statement
of Presiding Justice Garchitorena that petitioner had been charged before the
Sandiganbayan "with having favored unqualified aliens with the benefits of
the Alien Legalization Program."</p>

<p class="BODY">The statement complained of was just a restatement of the
Information filed against petitioner in Criminal Case No. 16698 in connection
with which the hold-departure order was issued.  Said Information specified the act constituting the offense
charged, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"That on or about
October 17, 1988, or for sometime prior or subsequent thereto, in Manila, </span>Philippines,
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, accused Miriam Defensor-­Santiago,
being then the Commissioner of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation,
with evident bad faith and manifest partiality, did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and criminally approve the application for legalization of aliens
who arrived in the Philippines after January 1, 1984 in violation of Executive
Order No. 324 dated April 13, 1988 which does not allow the legalization of the
same, thereby causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted
benefits and advantages to said aliens in the discharge of the official and
administrative functions of said accused" (Rollo, p. 36).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that petitioner tried to leave the country without
first securing the permission of the Sandiganbayan, prompting it to issue the
hold-departure order which Benigno viewed as uncalled for.  The letter of Presiding Justice
Garchitorena, written in defense of the dignity and integrity of the
Sandiganbayan, merely stated that all persons facing criminal charges in court,
with no exception, have to secure permission to leave the country.  Nowhere in the letter is the merit of the
charge against petitioner ever touched.  Certainly, there would have been no occasion for the letter had Benigno
not written his diatribe, unfair at that, against the Sandiganbayan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding petitioner's misgiving, it should be taken into
consideration that the Sandiganbayan sits in three divisions with three
justices in each division.  Unanimity
among the three members is mandatory for arriving at any decision of a division
(P.D. No. 1606, Sec. 5).  The collegiate
character of the Sandiganbayan thus renders baseless petitioner's fear of
prejudice and bias on the part of Presiding Justice Garchitorena (Paredes v.
Gopengco, 29 SCRA 688 [1969]).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:25.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:normal">Re:  <u>Claim of denial of due process</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner cannot complain that her constitutional rights to due
process were violated by reason of the delay in the termination of the
preliminary investigation.  According to
her, while the offense was allegedly committed "on or before October 17,
1988", the information was filed only on May 9, 1991 and the amended
informations on December 8, 1992 (Rollo, p. 14).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Tatad</u> v. <u>Sandiganbayan</u>, 159 SCRA 70 [1988] is
inapplicable to petitioner's case.  In <u>Tatad</u>,
there indeed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was an </span>unexplained
inaction on the part of the public prosecutors inspite of the simplicity of the
legal and factual issues involved therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, there was a continuum of the investigatory
process but it got snarled because of the complexity of the issues
involved.  The act complained of in the
original information came to the attention of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">Ombudsman </span>only when it was first reported in the January 10,
1989 issue of the <u>Manila Standard</u>.  Immediately thereafter, the investigatory process was set in
motion.  The investigation was first
assigned to Special Prosecutor Gualberto dela Llana but on request of
petitioner herself the investigation was re-assigned to the Office of the
Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon.  The case
was handled by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>panel of four prosecutors, who submitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>draft resolution for the filing of
the charges on March 29, 1990.  The
draft resolution had to undergo the hierarchy of review, normal for a draft
resolution with a dissenting vote, until it reached the Ombudsman in March
1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that petitioner had previously filed two petitions before
us involving Criminal Case No. 16698 (G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Nos. 99289-99290; G.R. No. 107598).  Petitioner has not explained why she failed to raise the issue of the
delay in the preliminary investigation and the filing of the information
against her in those petitions.  A
piece-meal presentation of issues, like the splitting of causes of action, is
self-defeating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next claims that the Amended Informations did not
charge any offense punishable under Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019 because the
official acts complained of therein were authorized under Executive Order No.
324 and that the Board of Commissioners of the Bureau of Investigation adopted
the policy of approving applications for legalization of spouses and unmarried,
minor children of "qualified aliens" even though they had arrived in
the Philippines after December 31, 1983.  She concludes that the Sandiganbayan erred in not granting her motion to
quash the informations (Rollo, pp. 25-31).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion to quash, the accused admits hypothetically the
allegations of fact in the information (People v. Supnad, 7 SCRA 603
[1963]).  Therefore, petitioner admitted
hypothetically in her motion that:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)  She was a public
officer;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)  She approved the
application for legalization of the stay of aliens, who arrived in the
Philippines after January 1, 1984;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)  Those aliens were
disqualified;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)  She was cognizant of
such fact; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(5)  She acted in
"evident bad faith and manifest partiality in the execution of her
official functions."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing allegations of fact constitute the elements of the
offense defined in Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claims that the acts complained of were indeed authorized
under Executive Order No. 324, that petitioner merely followed in good faith
the policy adopted by the Board of Commissioners and that the aliens were
spouses or unmarried minor children of persons qualified for legalization of
stay, are matters of defense which she can establish at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent petitioner's claim that the Amended Informations did not
allege that she had caused "undue injury to any party, including the
Government," there are two ways of violating Section 3 (e) of R.A. No.
3019.  These are:  (a) by causing any undue injury to any
party, including the Government; and (b) by giving any private party any
unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Uy</u> v. <u>Sandiganbayan</u>, G.R. No. 100334, December
5, 1991, we held:</p>

<blockquote>"The use of the distinctive term "or" connotes that
either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3 (a).  In other words the act of giving any private party any
unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference is not an indispensable element of
the offense of 'causing any undue injury to any party' as claimed by
petitioners although there may be instances where both elements concur."</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:25.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in;text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;font-weight:normal">Re:  </span><u><span style="font-weight:normal">Delito Continuado</span></u><span style="font-weight:
normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, our attention was attracted by the allegation
in the petition that the public prosecutors filed 32 Amended Informations
against petitioner, after manifesting to the Sandiganbayan that they would only
file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">one amended information (Rollo,
pp. 6-61).  We also noted that
petitioner questioned in her opposition to the motion to admit the 32 Amended
Informations, the splitting of the original information (Rollo, pp. 127-129).  In the furtherance of justice, we therefore
proceed to inquire deeper into the validity of said plaint, which petitioner
failed to pursue with vigor in her petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find that, technically, there was only one crime that was
committed in petitioner's case, and hence, there should only be one information
to be filed against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 32 Amended Informations charge what is known as <u>delito</u>
<u>continuado</u> or "continued crime" and sometimes referred to as
"continuous crime."</p>

<p class="BODY">In fairness to the Ombudsman's Office of the Special Prosecutor,
it should be borne in mind that the concept of <u>delito</u> <u>continuado</u>
has been a vexing problem in Criminal Law – difficult as it is to define and
more difficult to apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Cuello Calon, for <u>delito</u> <u>continuado</u> to
exist there should be a plurality of acts performed during a period of time;
unity of penal provision violated; and unity of criminal intent or purpose,
which means that two or more violations of the same penal provisions are united
in one and the same intent or resolution leading to the perpetration of the
same criminal purpose or aim (II Derecho Penal, p. 520; I Aquino, Revised Penal
Code, 630, 1987 ed).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">According to Guevarra, in
appearance, a </span><u>delito</u> <u>continuado</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">consists of several crimes but in reality there is only one crime in
the mind of the perpetrator (Commentaries on the Revised Penal Code, 1957 ed.,
p. 102; Penal Science and Philippine Criminal Law, p. 152).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Padilla views such offense as consisting of a series of acts
arising from one criminal intent or resolution (Criminal Law, 1988 ed. pp.
53-54).</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the concept of <u>delito</u> <u>continuado</u>, we
treated as constituting only one offense the following cases:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)  The theft of 13 cows
belonging to two different owners committed by the accused at the same place
and at the same period of time (People v. Tumlos, 67 Phil. 320 [1939]).</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)  The theft of six
roosters belonging to two different owners from the same coop and at the same
period of time (People v. Jaranillo, 55 SCRA 563 [1974]).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(3)  The theft of two roosters in the same place
and on the same occasion (People v. De Leon, 49 Phil. 437 [1926]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">(4)  The illegal charging
of fees for services rendered by a lawyer every time he collects veteran's
benefits on behalf of a client, who agreed that the attorney's fees shall be
paid out of said benefits (People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v.
Sabbun, </span>10 SCRA 156 [1964]).  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The collections of the legal fees were
impelled by </span>the same motive, that of collecting fees for services
rendered, and all acts of collection were made under the same criminal impulse
(People v. Lawas, 97 Phil. 975 [1955]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On other hand, we
declined to apply the concept to the following cases:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(1)  Two </span>estafa cases, one of which was
committed during the period from January 19 to December 1955 and the other from
January 1956 to July 1956 (People v. Dichupa, 113 Phil. 306 [1961]).  The said acts were committed on two
different occasions.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)  Several malversations
committed in May, June and July, 1936, and falsifications to conceal the said
offenses committed in August and October 1936.  The malversations and falsifications "were not the result of only
one purpose or of only one resolution to embezzle and falsify x x x"
(People v. Cid, 66 Phil. 354 [1938]).</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)  Two estafa cases, one
committed in December 1963 involving the failure of the collector to turn over
the installments for a radio and the other in June 1964 involving the pocketing
of the installments for a sewing machine (People v. Ledesma, 73 SCRA 77 [1976]</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)  75 estafa cases
committed by the conversion by the agent of collections from customers of the
employer made on different dates (Gamboa v. Court of Appeals, 68 SCRA 308
[1975]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The concept of <u>delito</u> <u>continuado</u>, although an
outcrop of the Spanish Penal Code, has been applied to crimes penalized under
special laws, e.g. violation of R.A. No. 145 penalizing the charging of fees
for services rendered following up claims for war veteran's benefits (People v.
Sabbun, 10 SCRA 156 [1964]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 10 of the Revised Penal Code, the Code shall be
supplementary to special laws, unless the latter provide the contrary.  Hence, legal principles developed from the
Penal Code may be applied in a supplementary capacity to crimes punished under
special laws.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The question of whether a
series of criminal acts over a period of time creates a single offense or
separate offenses has troubled also American Criminal Law and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">perplexed American courts as shown by the
several theories that have evolved in theft cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trend in theft cases is to follow the so-called "single
larceny" doctrine, that is, the taking of several things, whether
belonging to the same or different owners, at the same time and place
constitutes but one larceny.  Many
courts have abandoned the "separate larceny doctrine," under which
there was a distinct larceny as to the property of each victim.  Also abandoned was the doctrine that the
government has the discretion to prosecute the accused for one offense or for
as many distinct offenses as there are victims (Annotation, 37 ALR 3rd 1407,
1410-1414).</p>

<p class="BODY">The American courts following the "single larceny"
rule, look at the commission of the different criminal acts as but one
continuous act involving the same "transaction" or as done on the
same "occasion" (State v. Sampson, 157 Iowa 257, 138 NW 473; People
v. Johnson, 81 Mich. 573, 45 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">NW </span>1119;
State v. Larson, 85 Iowa 659, 52 NW 539).</p>

<p class="BODY">An American court held that a contrary rule would violate the
constitutional guarantee against putting a man in jeopardy twice for the same
offense (Annotation, 28 ALR 2d 1179).  Another court observed that the doctrine is a humane rule, since if a
separate charge could be filed for each act, the accused may be sentenced to
the penitentiary for the rest of his life (Annotation, 28 ALR 2d 1179).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, the original information charged petitioner
with performing a single criminal act - that of her approving the application
for legalization of aliens not qualified under the law to enjoy such privilege.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original information also averred that the criminal act:  (i) committed by petitioner was in violation
of a law - Executive Order No. 324 dated April 13, 1988, (ii) caused an undue
injury to one offended party, the Government, and (iii) was done on a single
day, i.e., on or about October 17, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 32 Amended Informations reproduced <u>verbatim</u> the
allegation of the original information, except that instead of the word
"aliens" in the original information each amended information states
the name of the individual whose stay was legalized.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing of the motion for a bill of particulars, the
public prosecutors manifested that they would file only one amended information
embodying the legalization of stay of the 32 aliens.  As stated in the Order dated November 12, 1992 of the
Sandiganbayan (First Division):</p>

<blockquote>"On the matter of the Bill of Particulars, the prosecution has
conceded categorically that the accusation against Miriam Defensor Santiago
consists of one violation of law represented by the approval of the applications
of 32 foreign nationals for availment (sic) of the Alien Legalization
Program.  In this respect, and
responding directly to the concerns of the accused through counsel, the
prosecution is categorical that there will not be 32 accusations but only one x
x x" (Rollo, p. 59).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The 32 Amended Informations aver that the offenses were committed
on the same period of time, i.e., on or about October 17, 1988.  The strong probability even exists that the
approval of the application for the legalization of the stay of the 32 aliens
was done by a single stroke of the pen, as when the approval was embodied in
the same document.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the public prosecutors manifested at the hearing of the
motion for a bill of particulars that the Government suffered a single harm or
injury.  The Sandiganbayan in its Order
dated November 13, 1992 stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Equally, the prosecution has stated that insofar as the
damage and prejudice to the government is concerned, the same is represented not
only by the very fact of the violation of law itself but because of the adverse
effect on the stability and security of the country in granting citizenship to
those not qualified" (Rollo, p. 59).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Resolution dated March 3, 1993 in Criminal
Case No. 16698 of the Sandiganbayan (First Division) is AFFIRMED and its
Resolution dated March 11, 1993 in Criminal Case No. 16698 is MODIFIED in the
sense that the Office of the Special Prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman
is directed to consolidate the 32 Amended Informations (Criminal Cases Nos.
18371 to 18402) into one information charging only one offense under the
original case number, i.e., No. 16698.  The temporary restraining order issued by this Court on March 25, 1993
is LIFTED insofar as to the disqualification of Presiding Justice Francis
Garchitorena is concerned.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">F<span style="text-transform:uppercase">eliciano,</span>
<i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent from the opinion written for the majority by Mr.
Justice Quiason, to the extent that that opinion directed the Office of the
Special Prosecutor of the Office of the Ombudsman to consolidate the thirty-two
(32) Amended Informations (Criminal Cases Nos. 18371 to 18402) into one
Information under the original case number, i.e., No. 16698.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that the Court should order the Sandiganbayan to
dismiss the thirty-two (32) Amended Informations, for that court seriously
erred in not granting petitioner’s Motion to Quash those Informations.  The grounds for my submission in this
respect were spelled out in detail in my dissenting opinion<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in <u>Miriam Defensor-Santiaqo v. Conrado M. Vasquez, Ombudsman, et al.</u>  (205 SCRA 162 at 174-180 [1992]), which I
beg leave to reproduce here:</p>

<blockquote>“The information filed before the <u>Sandiganbayan</u> in Criminal
Case No. 16698 charges the petitioner as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘That on or about October 17, 1988, or for sometime prior or
subsequent thereto, in Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, accused Miriam Defensor-Santiago, being then the Commissioner
of the Commission on Immigration and Deportation, with evident bad faith and
manifest partiality, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and criminally
approve the application for legalization of aliens who arrived in the
Philippines after January 1, 1984 in violation of Executive Order No. 324 dated
April 13, 1988 which does not allow the legalization of the same, thereby
causing undue injury to the government and giving unwarranted benefits and
advantage to the said aliens in the discharge of the official and
administrative functions of said accused.</p>

<p class="2Q">Contrary to law.’</p>

<blockquote>Essentially, the above information charges
that petitioner had, in violation of the provisions of Executive Order No. 324
approved applications for legalization of the stay of aliens who had arrived in
the Philippines <u>after</u> January 1, 1984.  The information takes the position that that Executive Order ‘does not
allow the legalization of the same.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Executive Order No. 324 entitled ‘Waiving Passport Requirements for
Immigrants under Certain Conditions,’ dated April 13, 1988, was promulgated
pursuant to Section 47 (A) (3) of C.A. No. 613, as amended, the Philippine
Immigration Act of 1940, which provides that</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Notwithstanding the provisions of this Act, the President is
authorized:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="tab-stops:85.5pt">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>when
the public interest to warrants:</p>

<p class="2Q">x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</p>

<p class="2Q">(3)  to waive the passport
requirements for immigrants, under such conditions as he may prescribe.’</p>

<blockquote>Executive Order No. 324 provides that an
alien may apply with the Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation for waiver
of passport requirements during a 12-month period beginning on a date to be
designated by the Commissioner.  The
Order provides, among other things, that the alien ‘must establish that he
entered the Philippines before January 1, 1984 and that he has resided
continuously in the Philippines in an unlawful status from such date to the
filing of his application.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioner is charged with having unlawfully waived the passport
requirements of certain aliens who arrived after January 1, 1984.  It is clear from the record of this case,
especially of the preliminary investigation conducted by the Office of the Special
Prosecutor, that petitioner herself stated that she had allowed <u>aliens who
had arrived in the Philippines after January 1, 1984, but who were the spouses
or minor children of qualified aliens</u> -- the latter being alien spouses or
parents who had entered the Philippines before January 1, 1984 an <u>who were
themselves qualified for waiver of passport requirements under Executive Order
No. 324</u> -- to apply for waiver of passport requirements and, after
compliance with requirements of Executive Order No. 324, approved such
‘legalization.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Executive Order No. 324 is not itself a statute prescribing penal
sanctions for certain acts.  Thus,
disregard of Executive Order No. 324 would not, by itself, give rise to
criminal liability.  The criminal
information in this case in effect links up Executive Order No. 324 with
Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act.  Section 3(e) of the
Anti-Graft Act reads as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>It must be noted, firstly, that petitioner, as the then
Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation, was expressly authorized and
obliged by Executive Order No. 324 to apply and administer and enforce its
provisions.  Indeed, petitioner was
authorized to issue rules and regulations to implement that Executive Order
(paragraph 16).  Secondly, the
application and administration of Executive Order No. 324 involve, not
ministerial or mechanical acts, but rather the exercise of judgment and
discretion, adjudicatory and hence quasi-judicial in nature.  Thirdly, and perhaps most notably,
paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Executive Order provide as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘11.  <u>Except as provided
in Paragraph 12, herein</u>, the Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation <u>may
waive exclusion grounds</u> under the Immigration Act in the case of individual
aliens <u>for humanitarian purposes to assure family unity or for the public
interest</u>.</p>

<p class="2Q">  12.  The <u>following grounds for exclusion may
not be waived by the Commissioner of Immigration and Deportation</u>, namely,
(a) those relating to criminals; (b) those relating to aliens likely to become
public charges; (c) those relating to drug offenses, except for so much of
those provisions as relates to a single offense of simple possession of
marijuana; and (d) those relating to national security and members of
subversive organization.</p>

<blockquote>Paragraph 11, it will be seen, expressly authorizes petitioner to
waive grounds for exclusion of aliens under the Immigrations Act in two (2)
cases:  (a) ‘for humanitarian purposes
to assure family unity;’ and (b) ‘for the public interest.’ Under Section 29(a)
of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940, as amended, the classes of aliens
excluded from entry into the Philippines include:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘(17)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Persons not
properly documented for admission as may be required under the provisions of
this Act.’<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Upon the other hand, paragraph 12 specifies
the categories of persons in whose cases no waiver of grounds of exclusion may
be granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It will be seen then that <u>the acts of petitioner, which the
information assumes to be criminal in nature, constituted official acts of
petitioner done in the course of applying, interpreting and construing
Executive Order No. 324</u>.  There is
no question that the applications for waiver of passport requirements by the
spouses and minor children of qualified aliens were admitted and approved by
petitioner ‘for humanitarian purposes to assure family unity.’ It is also not
disputed that the said alien spouses and minor children did not fall under any
of the (non-waivable) excluded classes listed in paragraph 12 of Executive
Order No. 324.  It is similarly
undisputed that <u>no one has pretended that petitioner had</u> any <u>personal</u>
or <u>corrupt interest</u> in any of the cases of alien spouses and minor
children of qualified aliens she had acted upon.  <u>No one has suggested</u>, for instance, <u>that the fees</u>
specified in paragraph 9 of Executive Order No. 324 either were not collected
by the Government or <u>were misappropriated by petitioner and converted to her
own use</u>.  It may be noted, incidentally,
that paragraph 9 expressly authorizes the Commissioner ‘in her discretion, [to]
charge a lower fee for the spouses and minor children below 21 years old of the
applicant.’ The criminal information, as noted above, included an allegation of
‘evident bad faith and manifest partiality.’ It is clear, however, that the
facts brought out in the preliminary investigation offered absolutely no basis
for such an allegation which is actually a conclusion offered by the Special
Prosecutor, much like the words ‘wilfully, unlawfully and criminally’ which are
recited redundantly in the criminal information here.  Again, the facts disclosed in the preliminary investigation
showed no <u>undue injury</u>.’ to the Government and no <u>unwarranted</u>
benefit or advantage’ to the alien wives and minor children of qualified aliens
<u>outside of the simple acceptance and approval of the applications for waiver
of passport requirements</u> (so called ‘legalization’) by petitioner.  In other words, <u>if the interpretation or
construction given by petitioner to Executive Order No. 324 is correct</u> --
i.e., that applications for waiver of passport requirements by alien wives and
minor children, arriving <u>after</u> January 1, 1984, of qualified aliens who
had themselves arrived in the Philippines <u>before</u> January 1, 1984 and who
were otherwise eligible under the terms and conditions of Executive Order No.
324 may be granted for humanitarian purposes in the interest of allowing or
restoring family unity -- there would be no ‘injury,’ let alone an ‘<u>undue</u>
injury,’ to the Government.  Neither can
the benefit of waiver of passport requirements in the cases of such spouses and
minor children of qualified aliens be deemed to be an ‘<u>unwarranted</u>’
benefit to such aliens <u>if petitioner’s interpretation of Executive Order No.
324 be held to be correct.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is a rule too firmly established to require documentation that
contemporaneous interpretations of a statute or implementing regulation by the
executive or administrative officials precisely charged with the implementation
of such a statute or regulation, are entitled to great weight and respect from
the courts.  This Court itself has in
many instances deferred to such interpretations rendered by such administrative
officers.  (See, e.g., Ramos v. Court of
Industrial Relations, 21 SCRA 1282 [1967]; Salavaria v. Buenviaje, 81 SCRA 722
[1978]; Asturias Sugar Central, Inc. v. Commissioner of Customs, 29 SCRA 617
[1969]; University of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 37 SCRA 54 [1971];
Lim Hao Ting v. Central Bank, 104 Phil. 573 [1958]).  But <u>even if an administrative interpretation be ultimately
found to be incorrect</u> as a matter of law by this Court, the <u>official
responsible</u> for such interpretation is <u>not, for that reason alone,</u>
to be held <u>liable personally</u>, whether civilly or criminally or
administratively.  It is just as firmly
settled that to impose liability upon the public officer who has so acted,
something far graver than error of law or error of judgment must be clearly
shown and that is corrupt personal intentions, personal malice or bad
faith.  (See generally Marcelo v.
Sandiganbayan, 185 SCRA 346 [1990]).  As
noted above, no such allegations were made during the preliminary investigation
in Criminal Case No. 16698.</blockquote>

<blockquote>My submission, with respect, is that whether the acts admittedly
done by petitioner were criminal in nature, is <u>a legal question</u>, on
which petitioner in effect asks us to rule in this Petition.  I believe, further, that there is nothing to
prevent this Court from addressing and ruling on this legal issue.  There is no real need for proof of any
additional essential facts apart from those already admitted by
petitioner.  <u>It seems to me that a
public officer is entitled to have legal questions like that before this Court
resolved at the earliest possible opportunity, that a public officer should not
be compelled to go through the aggravation, humiliation and expense of the
whole process of criminal trial, if the legal characterization of the acts
charged as criminal is the very issue at stake.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>I respectfully submit, still further, that the acts charged do
not, as a matter of law, constitute a crime.  Indeed, if the acts which petitioner admits having done constitute a
criminal offense, very serious consequences would follow for the administration
of law and government rules and regulations in general.  For the thrust of the criminal information
here would appear to be that public officers interpret and apply statutory and
regulatory provisions at their own peril and at the risk of criminal liability,
notwithstanding the absence of any corrupt intent to profit personally by any
such interpretation and application.”</u> (Underscoring in the penultimate and
ultimate paragraphs supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Information, quoted internally above, was filed in Criminal
Case No. 16698 back in 1 May 1991.  Approximately two-and-a-half (2-1/2) years later, the proceedings before
the Sandiganbayan are still going on, and indeed appear to me to be back to
where the case was at the time the original Information was filed.  Had this Court ruled on the <u>legal
question</u> which petitioner in effect had asked us to rule in <u>Santiago v.
Vasquez</u> (<u>supra</u>), this case should be terminated by now, one way or
the other.  Once more, I respectfully
submit that a public officer should not be compelled to go through the
aggravation, humiliation and expense of the whole process of criminal trial, if
the legal nature of the acts charged as criminal is the very issue at stake.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">While I share the view expressed by Mr. Justice Florentino P.
Feliciano in his dissent from the majority opinion in Miriam Defensor-Santiago
vs. Conrado Vasquez, et al. (205 SCRA 162), the decision in said case, however,
having become final, has, in my view, the effect of foreclosing the issues
there involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, in this petition now at bench (G.R. No. 109266), I
vote with the majority in simply directing, for the reasons expressed for the
Court by Mr. Justice Camilo D. Quiason, the consolidation of the thirty-two
Amended Informations into a single Information.</p>
