				<H3>RODOLFO DE LEON, PETITIONER, VS. CONRADO LINDO AND THE HONORABLE JUDGE PABLO D.
SUAREZ, RESPONDENTS. <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">An indication of the intensity of the rivalry
 for the position of
 Mayor of Ternate, Cavite, between petitioner Rodolfo de Leon, the KBL 
official candidate, and respondent Conrado Lindo, a KBL member who ran 
as an independent candidate, may be discerned from the fact that the 
former filed two suits against the latter in this Court.  In our 
decision promulgated last April 30,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  we affirmed a decision of respondent Commission on Elections 
dismissing a case for disqualification against private respondent Lindo 
on the ground of turncoatism.  For petitioner had been proclaimed mayor 
after the January 30 election, had assumed such position, and has been 
discharging its functions.  Under the circumstances, the Venezuela 
ruling called for application.  As qualified in Aguinaldo v. Commission 
on Elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  a
 
pre-proclamation controversy is no longer viable if, after the election 
for local officials, the winning candidate had been proclaimed and there
 was no pending petition for disqualification before this Court on 
January 30.

<p></p><p>This petition for certiorari and mandamus with a 
prayer for a 
restraining order arose from an order of respondent Judge, the late 
Pablo D. Suarez, granting private respondent a reasonable period of time
 to file an electoral protest.  It reads as follows:  "The Clerk of 
Court is hereby ordered to include among undocketed cases, in the 
meanwhile, the significance that Protestant Conrado C. Lindo has been 
granted an additional and reasonable period to register an Election 
Protest against Protestee Rodolfo de Leon, corresponding with the 
previous Local Elections for Ternate, Cavite."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  It is contended by petitioner that on its face it is violative of this
 provision of the 1978 Election Code:  "A sworn petition contesting the 
election of a municipal or municipal district officer shall be filed 
with the proper Court of First Instance by any candidate for the same 
office who has duly filed a certificate of candidacy, within ten days 
after the proclamation of the election."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  More specifically, there was a disregard of 
the ten-day period imposed by law.

</p><p>Then, soon after, came a Supplemental Petition.  It 
was therein 
alleged that petitioner was not aware of an order of respondent Judge 
denying his motion for reconsideration and at the same time proclaiming 
private respondent Lindo duly elected winner for the office of the Mayor
 of Ternate until after the original petition was filed.  He stressed 
anew the jurisdictional infirmity of the actuation of the lower court.  
He was specially vehement in his attack on the proclamation of private 
respondent as the duly elected Mayor of Ternate, considering that he had
 been proclaimed, had assumed the office, and has been discharging his 
duties as such.  The dispositive portion of this later order of 
respondent Judge reads as follows:  "[Wherefore], as prayed for, without
 prejudice to the ultimate decision congruent with the present election 
protest; the Court hereby declares and proclaims Protestant Conrado 
Lindo duly elected winner for the Office of Mayor of the Municipality of
 Ternate, Province of Cavite, corresponding with the local elections for
 the Municipality of Ternate, Province of Cavite, effectively as of 
January 30, 1980; considering the prior nullity of the election and 
proclamation of Protestee Rodolfo de Leon.  Protestant Conrado Lindo has
 no more lawful inhibitions to immediately assume the Office of Mayor of
 the Municipality of Ternate, Cavite, effective today, after taking his 
Oath of Office as such Mayor of Ternate, Cavite; while Protestee Rodolfo
 de Leon is hereby temporarily restrained from further continuing to 
discharge his prior duties as former Mayor of Ternate, Cavite, until 
further orders from this Court; when he shall have proved that he has a 
better right to it than Protestant Conrado Lindo during the hearings of 
the present protest."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 

</p><p>Comment was required of respondents, and a temporary 
restraining 
order was issued after the filing of the petition.  Comment was likewise
 required of respondents in the Supplemental Petition.  In the second of
 such Comments submitted after the Supplemental Petition, the grant of 
the additional and reasonable period to private respondent to institute 
an election protest was justified as within the sound discretion of a 
court of justice.  That was their submission likewise in the first 
Comment submitted.  The prayer was for the dismissal of the petition so 
that the resumption of the election protest could be ordered 
immediately.

</p><p>Such Comment was considered as the answer and the 
case was deemed submitted for decision.

</p><p>We sustain respondent Judge in granting the 
additional period.  
We rule against that portion of his order allowing private respondent to
 occupy the office of Mayor.  In that sense, the restraining order 
continues until the final disposition of this litigation.

</p><p>It was the existence of problems, a number of them 
novel in 
character, that arose after the elections for local government in 1980, 
that led to the exercise by this Court of its equitable powers.  
Accordingly, in appropriate cases, an objection raised on purely legal 
grounds based on the strict letter of the law was not deemed 
controlling.  What is undeniable is that ever since Venezuela v. 
Commission on Elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  
decided on July 25, 1980, this Court has allowed the losing party a 
reasonable period usually ten days within which to file an election 
protest.  That solution appears to be the most just and fair under the 
circumstances.  It is a further assurance that the wishes of the 
electorate would not be disregarded by what would amount to a definitive
 bar on determining who was the real people's choice.  In Venezuela, as 
well as in Agcaoili v. Santos and Commission on Elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  and in Disini v. 
Commission on Elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  a period of ten days was the one granted.  In 
Faderanga v. Commission on Elections,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  a fifteen-day period was granted the losing party.  In sustaining 
respondent Commission on Elections in the April decision of this Court, 
between petitioner de Leon and private respondent Lindo, it was made 
clear in the opening paragraph of the opinion citing Venezuela - the 
doctrine being given a more explicit form in Aguinaldo v. Commission on 
Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  - 
that it is a 
"generally accepted principle that a pre-proclamation controversy should
 be laid to rest [at a certain stage] there being the remedy of a 
protest or a quo warranto proceeding that could be utilized."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
  The election protest actually having been filed and having been acted 
upon by respondent Judge, it would not be in consonance with equity if 
at this stage it would not be allowed to continue.  All things 
considered, justice, another name for equity, would best be served by 
allowing the lower court, acting through the successor of respondent 
Judge, to continue hearing such protest until its final disposition.

</p><p>WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari is dismissed 
insofar as it
 would annul and set aside the challenged orders of respondent Judge 
continuing with hearing the election protest.  It is granted insofar as 
it would make permanent the restraining order preventing private 
respondent, Conrado Lindo, from discharging the Office of the Mayor of 
Ternate in the meanwhile, petitioner being entitled to continue doing 
so.  No costs.
