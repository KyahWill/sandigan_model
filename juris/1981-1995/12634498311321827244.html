discrepancies in the election returns and that there was also rampant
perpetration of threats, coercion and terrorism by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span> and his followers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought by private

therein, on grounds similar to those alleged in the election protest filed

in his <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> petition are proper grounds for an
election protest and that the setting aside of <span style="">his proclamation as mayor-elect is <span class="SpellE">violative</span>

acts sought to be restrained had already been consummated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span>, on one hand,
alleges that h<span style="">e </span>was elected
mayor by a majority of two (2) votes and <span style="">was
proclaimed on </span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1980"><span style="">January 31, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> and he is await­ing the decision of the case
by the Supreme Court; and that while there is confusion in the community and a
feeling of tension, there is, however, no violence as reported.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>I<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pivotal issue to be
resolved in the instant case is whether or not the respondent Commission on
Elections acted with grave abuse of discretion, amount­ing to lack of
jurisdiction, in entertaining and proceed­ing with Pre-Proclamation Case No.
372 and promulgating therein questioned resolutions Nos. 9449 and 9552.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">WE hold that under the premises, respondent Commission on
Elections committed a grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed, as alleged by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span>,
that he was duly proclaimed on <u>January 31, 1980</u> as mayor of San
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> by the Muni­cipal Board of
Canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 7, 1980,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> filed an election protest against
petitioner before the Court of First Instance alleg­ing the tampering of the
election returns of Voting Centers Nos. 3-A and 4-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, on <u>February 11, 1980</u>, or four
(4) days after he filed his election protest with the Court of First Instance <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> filed a petition with the
respondent Commission on Elections seeking to nullify the canvass and proclamation
of petitioner herein also invoking the same grounds on which his election
protest is predicated, which was docketed as Pre-Proclamation Case No. 372.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that under Section 175 of the 1978 Election
Code, the Commission on Elections is the "sole judge of all <u>pre-proclamation</u>
controversies and any of its decisions, orders or rulings shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>," the aforesaid case, now subject of the
instant petition, cannot be considered a pre-proclamation controversy for the
reasons herein below stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE consider the fact that after the proclamation of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span> on January 31, 1980, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> immediately resorted to the remedy of filing a
regular election protest, which he filed on February 7, 1980 with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>; consequently, the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> acquired jurisdiction over
the controversy to the exclusion of the Commission on Elections, before which
the so-called pre-proclamation petition was filed only four days later -- on
February 11, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is consistent
with the established rule that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Once a court of first instance has acquired jurisdiction by virtue
of the filing of an election protest, all ques­tions relative thereto will be
decided in the case itself and not in another proceeding before a different
forum" (<span class="SpellE">Filart</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
L-35154, Oct. 26, 1973, 53 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 457, 473; Reyes vs.
Reyes, L-28476, Jan. 31, 1968, 22 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 485; <span class="SpellE">Acain</span> vs. <span style="">Board of </span>Canvassers,
L-16445, May 23, 1960, 108 Phil. 165).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Explaining the rationale of the above doctrine in Reyes vs. Reyes, <u>supra</u>,
Mr. Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando, then Associate Justice, stated that --</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> There
can be no more appropriate disposition of a dispute of this character than a <span style="">recognition </span>of the prior competence of
a court of justice whenever an election protest has been filed to determine who
of the parties is entitled to the position in controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be conducive to confusion and
conflict in authority if under the circumstances, as above disclosed, the
Commission on Elections would still be considered as having the residual power
to interfere with a pending election protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such an undesirable result should be avoided and the <span class="SpellE">Acain</span>
holding if referred to, as respondent Commission on Elections did, would serve
such purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is true that private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> subsequently filed on February 8,
1980 (one day after he filed on February 7, 1980 his election protest) a
manifestation with the <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> Court </span>of First
Instance wherein he stated that the filing of his election protest is to be
taken and understood <span style="">as </span>without
prejudice to his filing of a petition for the annulment of the proclamation of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span> before the Commission on
Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, aside from the fact that
it was rather belated, the same appears to be an afterthought on the part of
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> that merits no
consideration at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be added that having availed of an election protest
before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
instead of properly raising a pre-procla­mation controversy before the
Commission on Elections, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> is
deemed <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from filing a petition with the
Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actuation
is not only a recognition of petitioner's proclamation as the duly elected
municipal mayor but also that the case is not proper as a pre-proclamation
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, private respondent's petition was filed only on <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1980">February 11, 1980</st1:date> with the Commission
on Elec­tions, after the <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1980">January 30,
 1980</st1:date> local elections and <span style="">after
the proclamation of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span> on </span><st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1980"><span style="">January
 31, </span>1980</st1:date> and after respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>
filed an electoral protest on <st1:date month="2" day="7" year="1980">February
 7, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such
circumstances, We must adhere to the doctrine that "after an election duly
held and a proclamation thereafter made, a pre-proclamation controversy should
no longer be viable" (<span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 53953, Feb. 5,
1981; <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 54039, Nov. 28, 1980; <span class="SpellE">Singco</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
52830, Nov. 28, 1980).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing vital facts distinguish the instant petition from
the <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> case (<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
52749, March 31, 1981), which was a pure -- not a hybrid --­ pre-proclamation
proceeding, as it was filed on February 2, 1980 by therein respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> or three (3) days prior to the proclamation on
February 5, 1980 of therein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no prejudice
whatsoever that could be caused to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>
because he could still prove the alleged tampering, alteration and
falsification of election returns as well as the </span><span style="">existence </span><span style="">of
discrepancies in the returns in the election protest which he himself had filed
on February 7, 1980 with the Court of First Instance </span>of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, and to which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span>
had filed on February 18, 1980 an answer with a counter-protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, to <span class="GramE">Our</span> mind,
the appropriate remedy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, "it
would save the time and energy of the litigants as well as respondent
Commission, and eventually this Court in view of its appellate jurisdiction, if
the matter were passed upon in an election protest or <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> petition in the lower court, the office
involved being that of municipal mayor" (<span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span>
<span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
<u>supra</u>; Venezuela <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 53532, July 25,
1980).</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in the more recent case of <span class="SpellE">Mitmug</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No.
54082, March 24, 1981), Mr. Chief Justice Fernando, speaking for the Court,
declared that "an election protest should settle the matter conclusively
once and for all, instead of the parties <span style="">being
caught in the procedural meshes of a pre-proclamation controversy."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><u>II<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the motion for contempt, it appears that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> had already assumed the office of
mayor of <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place> before he received the restraining
order dated <st1:date month="6" day="5" year="1980">June 5, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the said restraining order merely
restrained respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span> "from assuming the
office of mayor" and did not require him to vacate the same in case he had
already assumed the office, it would seem that he cannot be held in contempt of
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged contemptuous remark of respondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>
referring to the fact that "if ever there was any restraining order at all
it was a mere scrap of toilet paper," which claim of petitioner is
supported by the affidavit of 30 residents, is denied by re­spondent <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>, whose denial is also supported by 61 residents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under such a situation, the contempt charge
is not tenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, petitioner Francisco C. <span class="SpellE">Mogueis</span>
Jr. took his oath of office on March 3 or 15, 1980, after he was duly
proclaimed as the duly elected mayor of <st1:city><st1:place>San Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place> on <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1980">January 31, 1980</st1:date>.</p>
