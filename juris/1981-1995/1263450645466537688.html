				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In this original Petition
for <i>Certiorari</i>, the People seek to set aside 1) the Amended Decision of
respondent Judge, dated August 1, 1980, acquitting herein respondents who were
the accused in Criminal Case No. 1020, and 2) the Orders of August 21, 1980 and
September 1, 1980 denying reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">antecedental</span>
facts follow:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On March 20, 1979, the
three private respondents and two others were charged with the crime of
Frustrated Murder for having stabbed with a pointed bladed weapon one Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>, inflicting upon him a stab wound, thus performing
all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of Murder as a
consequence were it not for the timely medical attendance rendered to said
victim, which prevented his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After pleas of Not Guilty
were entered, trial proceeded with the accused setting up the common defense of
"general denial" by disclaiming knowledge and/or participation in the
commission of the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="7"><span style="">July 10,
 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent
Judge rendered a Decision finding the guilt of the three private respondents
proven beyond reasonable doubt and con­victing them of the crime charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other two accused had remained at large
and were not tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supportive of the
conviction, respondent Judge explained:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The issue must be resolved in the affirmative side because no
mount of general details as a defense can overcome or off-set the clear and
positive identification (of all the accused as the perpetrators of the crime
charged in the information) by the several witnesses of the prosecution
especially Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and William Gonzales who
were the offended parties and at the same time eye-witnesses to the stabbing at
<span style="">about 4:30 P.M. of November 27, 1978,
inside the premises of the beerhouse located at <span class="SpellE">Modiit</span>,
Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>; The act of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> in ordering or commanding his co-accused '<u>to
kill <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and Gonzales and give them reminder</u>'
and in immediate response, they <span class="SpellE">consentedly</span> and
simultaneously, one after the other, actually acted in conspiracy, stabbed and
stoned their victims and as a result, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
was stabbed by <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Tubaña</span>
and the rest of the other accused stoned <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and
Gonzales; the act of one was, therefore, the criminal act and responsibility of
all the said accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission of
the crime at bar by all the accused was also attended with evident
premeditation because after two (2) successive request to borrow the motorcycle
by <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> from <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and the latter refusal because <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span>
<span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> was drunk, the latter uttered '<u>Vulva of
your mother</u>' and then followed '<u>Kill them and give them reminder</u>',
by the interval of the utterances which were made after the other in a
considerable space of tine, all the accused were already alerted and placed on
reflection and had decided to undividedly respond to the order of their
commander <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span>
and which resulted to the stabbing of <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and the
stoning of Gonzales.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"AMENDED DECISION</blockquote>

<blockquote>Acting upon the motion for new trial and finding the same to be
merit­orious, the same is hereby given due course.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The basis for new trial is upon the newly discovered witness or
evidence in the person of <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span> <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span>
who, on July 25, 1980, in open court, tes­tified as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on November 27, 1978, in the afternoon
together with Federico <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> were in the beer
house at <span class="SpellE">Modiit</span>, Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>,
at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon; that they occupied a table and began
ordering beer; that at about 4:30 that same afternoon, two persons or customers
came inside the beer house in the person of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
and William Gonzales who rode on a motorcycle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When these two persons had already parked their motorcycle they also
entered the beer <span style="">house </span>and
occupied another table and began ordering beer; their tables were near each
other; afterwards, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and William Gonzales
were talking in a loud voice and then Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
stood up and shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Vulva of your
mother', addressed to his companion William Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other customers inside the beer house
were surprised and so the persons inside began to disperse; While the people
inside were busy dispersing, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Tubaña</span> who were inside the
kitchen of the beer house overheard the loud voices and shouts or Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and William Gonzales who were at that time arguing
each other as to who of them would pay for their bills in the beer house;
hence, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tubaña</span> went out of the kitchen and accosted and
brought Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and William Gon­zales outside
the beer house because they did not want trouble inside the beer house; the two
were able to pacify Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and William
Gonzales and were taken outside the beer house; when Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
and William Gonzales were already outside the beer house, they continued
quarreling with each other and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Tubaña</span> returned inside the
beer house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
and William Gonzales continued quarreling and then William Gonzales said to
Romeo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>,
'<u>If </u><u><span style="">you do not stop, then I
will give you something</span></u><span style="">' </span>and
at the same time he unsheathed a knife placed on his waist and <span class="SpellE">thrusted</span> it on the right <span style="">chest </span>of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>; hence, the
injury inflicted upon Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> and be­cause it
was not serious, the two (2) went together and rode on the same motorcycle and
proceeded to the highway until they reached the <span class="SpellE">Bangued</span>
Christian Hospital where Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span> was
treated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
and William Gonzales had left the beer house, this witness and Federico <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> also left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The witness was cross-examined by the Acting 1st Assistant
Provincial Fiscal Carlos B. <span class="SpellE">Barbero</span> and after the
cross examination, the defense submitted their case on new trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>'<u>Whether or not the accused are
prima facie guilty of the crime </u><u><span style="">of
Frustrated </span>Murder as alleged in the Information</u>.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span> <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span> on new trial had completely erased any and all
criminal liability and/or parti­cipations of the accused in the present case
because said witness, had positively testified during said new trial that it
was William Gonzales, the companion of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>,
who stabbed the latter and not any of the accused in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This testimony of <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span> on new trial was never rebutted by the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, therefore, the
charge of Frustrated Murder in the Information, if the Office of the Provincial
Fiscal should have carefully investigated this case, it would have found out
the correct culprit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered acquitting all the accused
in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With
costs de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>.</span></blockquote>

liberty during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case are hereby
released and cancelled.</blockquote>

submit the Supreme Court Decision that was required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Order is likewise assailed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues presented for
resolution in these <i>Certiorari</i> proceedings are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"First, whether or not the petitioner People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<blockquote>Second, whether or not the respondent judge acted without or in
excess of jurisdiction and/or committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the Amended Decision of August 1,
1980 and the Order dated September 1, 1980 deny­ing a motion for

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the record, we are
hard-pressed to find deprivation of due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner con­tends that "while the
counsels for the accused were allowed to argue fully in support of their motion
for reconsideration and motion for new trial, the Fiscal was allowed to argue
only against the motion for reconsideration." That contention is not
supported by the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> portions of the
transcript taken during the hearing of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;

</span>Again, contrary to the prosecution contention, the Fiscal was given a
chance to argue against the Motion for New Trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he expounded:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL <span class="SpellE">BARBERO</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The
testimony of proposed witness <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span> <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span>, Your Honor, tends to show that it was William
Gonzales who stabbed the victim, and going over the motion <span style="">for new trial, witness <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span> is a first degree cousin of <span class="SpellE">Cosme</span> <span class="SpellE">Calibuso</span> and known to me
personally being a neighbor in <span class="SpellE">Lagangilang</span> and
Dolores, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;

court during the trial and in fact he is here now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even during the trial, Your Honor, he was
here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How could the defense say now that
he is <span class="GramE">a newly</span> discovered evidence."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">True, respondent Judge
forthwith proceeded to take <span class="SpellE">Talingdan's</span>
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Fiscal was given
all the opportunity to cross-examine said witness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is not apt to state
that the Order of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="7"><span style="">July 25, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> resolved only the Motion for
Reconsideration, not the Motion for </span><span style="">New </span><span style="">Trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The verbal Order during the hearing held on
said date stated in no uncertain terms "new trial is given due

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also inaccurate to

apparently, respondent Judge had forgotten what had transpired during the

course." While, in fact, misleading, the Trial Fiscal was present during
the hearing, was informed that the new trial had been granted, and that the
decision based thereon was to be promulgated on a certain date.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fiscal had pointedly
asked "are </span><span style="">we </span><span style="">made to understand that the motion for new

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be that as it may,
respondent Judge committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction when he granted new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts sought to be established by the
testimonies of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span> and Fernandez
could not be considered newly discovered evidence within the meaning of the law
(Sec. 2(b), Rule 121, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have been discovered and produced
during the trial with the exercise of reasonable diligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were forgotten evidence, which is not a
ground for new trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, more meticulous
and careful evaluation would have disclosed that the <span class="SpellE">proferred</span>
evidence could not, in any way, have altered the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could only affect the credibility of
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was essentially impeaching
in character.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>William Gonzales was himself the victim of stoning by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a witness at the trial and pointed to
the accused as the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense
had sufficient opportunity to turn the tables on him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if, as testified to by <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span>, William Gonzales had stabbed the victim, it is
highly incredible that they would have ridden together o</span><span style="">n</span><span style="">
the same motorcycle going to the highway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On other hand, as stated in his original Decision, respondent Judge had
categorically found that the offended parties Romeo <span class="SpellE">Dukinal</span>
and William Gonzales had clearly and positively identified the accused as the
culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence introduced by the
prosecution at the ori­ginal trial was too strong to be overcome by a repro­duction
on the witness stand of the contents of the affidavits of the <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was grave abuse of discretion, therefore, on the part of respondent </span><span style="">Judge to have rendered the Amended Decision
acquitting the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should also
be called to task for his lack of clear-cut procedures that led to confusion in
the proceedings before him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Notwithstanding, the
error committed can no longer be rectified under the cardinal rule on double
jeopardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of acquittal in
favor of an accused neces­sarily ends the case in which he is prosecuted and
the same cannot be appealed nor reopened because of the do</span><span style="">c</span><span style="">trine
that nobody may be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents have been formally acquitted by
respondent Court, albeit erroneously.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That judgment of acquittal is a final verdict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Errors </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">irregularities, which
do not render the proceedings </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">nullity, will not defeat a plea of </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">antrefois</span></i></span><i><span style=""> acquit</span></i><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The <span class="GramE">proceedings</span> in

was not without the opportunity to present its evidence or even to rebut the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Leonico</span> <span class="SpellE">Talingdan</span>,
the witness on new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be
justifiably claimed, therefore, that the prosecution was deprived of its day in
Court and denied due process of law, which would have rendered the judg­ment of
acquittal a nullity</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and beyond the pale of a claim of double
