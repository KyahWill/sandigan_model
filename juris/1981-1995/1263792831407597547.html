				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Ministry of Labor and Employment in its order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1985</st1:date> ordered North Camarines
Lumber Company, Inc. to reinstate Francisco Barreda to his former position
without loss of seniority rights and to pay him backwages for two years without
reduction or qualification.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">North Camarines Lumber
Co., INC. in the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> dated </span><st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April
 25, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> asked that
the MOLE order be reversed and the dismissal of Barreda upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Barreda was employed as a
scaler by petitioner company in 1963.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
1978, he became supervisor of the fell and buck section.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On January 25, 1979,
petitioner issued the fol­lowing memorandum:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Memo M-21/79</blockquote>

<blockquote>To:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All Employees</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subject:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Observance of Company Rules and Regulations</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We wish to enjoin each and every employee to comply strictly
with the company rules and regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Vio­lations thereof affect not only your record as an employee but may
mean <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">termination of your employment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We wish to reiterate that the penalty for the third offense
during the year is separation from the ser­vice, regardless of whether the
first two offenses were penalized by warning, reprimand or suspension."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It appears that in 1979
Barreda committed two offenses for </span>which he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">was suspended for a total of twenty days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On October 21, 1979, a Sunday, he com­mitted
the alleged unpardonable third offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He figured </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a boxing </span>incident
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">with Fernando Fernandez, a security
guard of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident, as
admitted by petitioner, occurred in the store of one Floriano Barreda located
within the company auxiliary compound where the veneer plant proper and the
resi­dential houses of petitioner's staff officers are situated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The store is approximately fifteen meters
from the north gate of the compound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, petitioner addressed a memo­randum to Barreda
terminating him for having assaulted a fellow employee without sufficient
provocation and placing him under suspension pending clearance from the
Ministry <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whereupon, on October 26, 1979, petitioner filed with the MOLE an
application for clearance to terminate Barreda's employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The regional director granted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>required clearance but on appeal
the MOLE set it aside and issued the order subject of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We hold that the MOLE did
not commit any grave abuse of discretion in ordering the reinstatement of
Barreda with backwages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether the
third offense attri­buted to Barreda was committed while the latter was off
duty and outside the company premises is not the crucial issue here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it is the inequitable manner </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">which </span>Barreda was discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY">While conceding the employer's basic right to regulate the
conduct of its employees while inside c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ompany
</span>premises, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">we </span>cannot help
but notice the unusual zeal and haste displayed by petitioner in applying the
full force of its rules on Barreda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Undoubtedly, the boxing episode was completely blown out of
proportion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fisticuffs were plainly
a private matter between the two employees which had no apparent deleterious
effect on the substantial interests of the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consider­ing Barreda's length of service with
petitioner, coupled with the attendant circumstances, the penalty of dis­missal
was certainly not commensurate with his alleged misconduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We affirm his reinstatement with backwages
for two years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court Resolved to DISMISS the petition
for lack of merit.</p>

<span style="font-style:italic">Gutierrez, Jr., Feliciano, Bidin,<span style="font-style:normal">
and </span>Cortes, JJ.,<span style="font-style:normal"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
