ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of an order of the Honorable Judge Alfin S. Vicencio of the then Court of First
Instance of Masbate in Special Proceeding No. 2800, entitled, "In re:
Petition for Reconstitution of Lost Title, Rogelio Zuniga, Petitioner,"
requiring the publication of the Notice of Hearing of the said case not only
twice in the Official Gazette but also in a newspaper, or, more aptly, a
tabloid, the "Sorsogon Newsweek."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition raises only a question of law. The following are the
facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1978</st1:date>,
the petitioner, Rogelio Zuniga filed a petition for the reconstitution of an
Original Certificate of Title allegedly issued to one Fermin Almocera in 1933
by virtue of a homestead patent. According to the petitioner, the original copy
of the title, which was on file in the Office of the Register of Deeds of the
Province of Masbate, and the owner's duplicate certificate thereof, which was
in the possession of the registered owner, had been lost or destroyed.
Petitioner Zuniga further averred that he purchased the property covered by the
lost <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> certificate of title from one Irene S.
Dolera who bought it earlier from the registered owner, Fermin Almocera.</p>

<p class="BODY">After nearly three years, on <st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1981">July 6, 1981</st1:date>, the lower court through the respondent
judge, finally came around to issuing a Notice of Hearing of the petition. The
respondent Judge however, aside from requiring the publication of the notice
twice in the Official Gazette, further ordered publication specifically in the
Sorsogon Newsweek, a newspaper published in Bulan, Sorsogon. The petitioner
objected to the publication in the Sorsogon Newsweek arguing that such
publication is not required by law, and furthermore, it would only entail
unnecessary expense, P700.00 to be exact, which he did not have. He added that
the tabloid preferred by the respondent Judge had only a very limited
circulation in <st1:place>Masbate</st1:place>. As a matter of fact, he
represented that there are no copies of its issues for sale in the entire
province of Masbate and "only those who have published matters therein are
being furnished copies ..."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, he concluded, this requirement of publication was an expensive exercise
in futility. Hence, he moved for a reconsideration of the court's order.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge however, unconvinced by the petitioner's protestations, on
<st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">denied</span> the motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner then came straight up to us praying that the trial
court's Notice of Hearing be set aside and a new one in accordance with Section
13 of Republic Act No. 26 in relation to Section 110 of Presidential Decree No.
1529 be issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1981</st1:date>,
we gave due course to the petition and required the parties to submit
simultaneous memoranda.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The parties complied, the petitioner filing his Memorandum on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1981</st1:date> while the respondent
Judge submitted his on <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="2">February 19,
 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue that needs to be resolved in this petition is
whether or not publication of the Notice of Hearing of the petition for the
reconstitution of a lost or destroyed original of a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
certificate of title in a local newspaper is required by the law. The
petitioner submits that such publication is not required. The respondent Judge,
on the other hand, asserts otherwise. We find the petitioner's contention amply
supported by Republic Act No. 26, "An Act Providing a Special Procedure
for the Reconstitution of Torrens Certificate of Title Lost or Destroyed,"
approved on September 25, 1946. and Presidential Decree No. 1529,
"Property Registration Decree," issued on <st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1978">June 11, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 13 of Republic Act No. 26, the earlier law on the
subject, provides:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 13. The court shall cause a notice of the petition, filed
under the preceding section, to be published, at the expense of the petitioner,
twice in successive issues of the Official Gazette, and to be posted on the
main entrance of the provincial building and of the municipal building of the
municipality or city in which the land is situated, at least thirty days prior
to the date of hearing. The court shall likewise cause a copy of the notice to
be sent, by registered mail or otherwise, at the expense of the petitioner, to
every person named therein whose address is known, at least thirty days prior
to the date of hearing. Said notice shall state, among other things, the number
of the lost or destroyed certificate of title, if known, the name of the
registered owner, the names of the occupant or persons in possession of the
property, the owners of the adjoining properties and all other interested
parties, the location, area and boundaries of the property, and the date on
which all persons having any interest therein must appear and file their claim
or objections to the petition. The petitioner shall, at the hearing, submit
proof of the publication, posting and service of the notice as directed by the
court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge's contention that Republic Act No. 26 has
been repealed by P.D. No. 1529, the Property Registration Decree,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
is not correct. True, Section 120 of P.D. No. 1529 provides that:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 120. Repealing clause. -- All laws, decrees, orders, rules and
regulations, or parts thereof, in conflict or inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this Decree are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Yet, we do not find Section 13 of
Republic Act No. 26 inconsistent with the Property Registration Decree. On the
contrary, the Decree explicitly restates by reference the applicability of
Republic Act No. 26 to the judicial reconstitution of lost or destroyed <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
titles, in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 110. Reconstitution of lost or destroyed original of <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title. -- Original copies of certificates of title lost or destroyed in the
offices of Register of Deeds as well as liens and encumbrances affecting the
lands covered by such titles shall be reconstituted judicially in accordance
with the procedure prescribed in Republic Act No. 26 insofar as not
inconsistent with this Decree. The procedure relative to administrative
reconstitution of lost or destroyed certificate prescribed in said Act is
hereby abrogated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By and large, what Section 110 of P.D. No. 1529 abrogated in R.A.
No. 26 is the latter's provisions on administrative reconstitution. The
procedure on judicial reconstitution under R.A. No. 26, including Section 13
thereof, has not been repealed or modified, whether expressly or impliedly.
That procedure remains unchanged and, therefore, still applies. Publication of
the notice of the hearing of the petition in a newspaper is not required.
Publication of the notice in two successive issues of the Official Gazette
(with the required postings and the "notice by registered mail or
otherwise") suffices.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge invokes Section 23 of Presidential Decree
No. 1529. The invocation is fatally flawed simply because the law he relied
upon is inapplicable to the case. Section 23 refers to the publication of the
notice of the initial hearing of the application for the original registration
of title to land in ordinary registration proceedings and not to the
publication of the notice of hearing of a petition for the reconstitution of a <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title which had been lost or destroyed. The pertinent part of the section
insisted upon by the respondent Judge sates:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 23. Notice of initial hearing, publication, etc. -- The court
shall, within five days from filing of the application (for registration of
title to land -- see Sec. 14), issue an order setting the date and hour of the
initial hearing which shall not be earlier than forty-five days nor later than
ninety days from the date of the order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The public shall be given notice of the initial hearing of the
application for land registration by means of (1) publication; (2) mailing; and
(3) posting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. <span class="GramE">By</span> publication. —</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon receipt of the order of the court setting the time for initial
hearing, the Commissioner of Land Registration shall cause a notice of initial
hearing to be published once in the Official Gazette and once in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Philippines: Provided, however, that the publication
in the Official Gazette shall be sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the
court. Said notice shall be addressed to all persons appearing to have an
interest in the land, involved including the adjoining owners so far as known,
and "to all whom it may concern". Said notice shall also require all
persons concerned to appear in court at a certain date and time to show cause
why the prayer of said application shall not be granted.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>xxx <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can thus be seen that had there been some circumspection on
the part of the respondent Judge, this protracted controversy would have been
obviated. Certainly, a little more study would have ended this case in the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the fear intimated by the respondent Judge that fake
land titles might proliferate if petitions for reconstitution of lost or
destroyed <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titled are not published in a
newspaper of general circulation in addition to the publication in the Official
Gazette and the required postings and mailing, is unfounded. Experience has
taught us that hardly anybody reads the legal notices in newspapers, published
as they are in fine prints and buried in inconspicuous parts of the inside
pages. We also know that most of these so-called newspapers officially and
indiscriminately authorized by the various courts for the publication of legal
notices are fly-by-night tabloids with no appreciable circulation at all. This
situation has become so anomalous as that the requirement for newspaper publication
of notices of hearing has degenerated into a racket that has become a bane in
the administration of justice. And this racket is doubly abhorrent because the
rates, which, more often than not, are shared by some dishonest court
personnel, are scandalously exhorbitant, running into thousands of pesos for
the publication of a simple notice of hearing, (in the instant case the charge
was supposed to be P700.00), which many litigants can not afford. The Court can
not countenance such perversion or the purpose of the publication of legal
notices. To require publication without a clear legal basis would exacerbate
the anomaly. It follows that where there is no specific legal provision or rule
requiring publication, as there is none in this case, the Court will not
require it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the Order
on the publication of the Notice of Hearing, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1981</st1:date>. in the Sorsogon Newsweek, and the
Resolution, dated July 20, 1981, denying the Motion for Reconsideration filed by
the petitioner, issued by the respondent Judge in Special Proceedings No. 2800,
are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. The Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial
Court in which the said proceeding is pending is hereby ORDERED to immediately
issue another Notice of Hearing of the petition in accordance with the
provisions of Section 13 of Republic Act No. 26, requiring publication only in
two successive issues of the Official Gazette, plus the required postings and
mailing, stating all the pertinent data specified in the said Section 13, in
