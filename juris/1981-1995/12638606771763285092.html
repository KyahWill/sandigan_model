entitled "Maxima R. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>, Inc." The NLRC modified the April 26, 1985
decision of the Labor Arbiter which sustained the termination/dismissal of
respondent employee by <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>, Inc., but directed
the latter to pay the former certain short payments and withheld payments in
the total amount of P199.26.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent Commission ordered the reinstatement of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Maxima R. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was
employed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>, Inc., on <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1973</st1:date>, as salesclerk­-<span class="SpellE">invoicer</span> in its cosmetics department.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1981</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> sent <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> a
notice of termination on the ground of abandonment of work from <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1981</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, in turn,
filed a complaint with the then Ministry of Labor and Employment (Case No. <span class="GramE">AB-4-10849-81) for illegal dismissal and certain money claims.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the case was pending before the labor

<p class="BODY">Despite <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> reinstatement, trial
proceeded but only on the issue of money claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="12">December
 7, 1981</st1:date> a decision was rendered by the Labor Arbiter in favor of
Maxima <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent SHOEMART, INC., of 627 C. <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> Sr., St., San Miguel, Manila, is directed to pay

<p class="BODY">An appeal to the NLRC was dismissed in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 44, Rollo-63912)</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, after her reinstatement, due to a diffi­cult
pregnancy, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> filed successive leaves of
absences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1981</st1:date>, when she was four (4) months

abortion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1981</st1:date> she applied for four (4) months

 1981</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1982</st1:date>
upon her physician's advice to avoid possible complications in her
pregnancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then on <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
applied for forty-five (45) days maternity leave (February 21, 1982 to April 7,
1982) giving <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1982</st1:date>
as her expected date of confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
these applications were granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the expiration of her maternity leave, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
did not report back for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No leave
extension having been granted nor any word sent to <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>
as to why she could not report for work, her continued absence was marked
unauthorized.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 15, 1982, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> sent a
notice to <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> stating that she had not yet
delivered her baby, and that she could have been mistaken in her
"counting." <span class="SpellE">Shoemart's</span> department manager
accepted the note but in­formed its bearer (<span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span>
husband) that <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> should report for work on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1982</st1:date> and on the succeeding days, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> did not return to work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not inform <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>
of her condition nor give any reason for her unexplained absence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>
was prompted to terminate her services for gross neglect of duty amounting to
abandonment of work under Article VI of its Rules and Regulations which is also
a ground for dismissal under the New Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 7, 1983, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> filed a new
complaint with the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE) [NLRC-NCR Case No.
10-4473-83] charging <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> with illegal dismissal,
violation of PD 1571 (integration into the basic wage of the emergency cost of
living allowances under PD 525 and PD 1123) and of the CBA wage increase of
P1.00 a day effective July 1, 1981, and withholding of SSS check for sickness
benefits in the amount of P122.70 (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision dated <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1985</st1:date>, the labor arbiter found <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span>
dismissal justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he ordered
<span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> to pay her the amount of P76.56 repre­senting
her short payment and unpaid P1.00 wage increase a day per existing CBA, plus
the amount of P122.70 cover­ing the withheld payment of her sickness benefits,
or a total of P199.26." (p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, the NLRC on appeal modified the decision of
the labor arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It ruled that the dis­charge
of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was illegal for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of procedural due process as mandated in BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 130
and ordered her reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One commissioner dissented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC decision states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered the appealed Decision is
hereby, MODIFIED as above discussed, by ordering respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
to reinstate complainant-appellant to her posi­tion without loss of seniority

up to the time of actual reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> are (sic)

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1986</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> filed a motion for reconsideration of the
aforesaid decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was sub­sequently
denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner submits that respondent NLRC gravely abused its
discretion when it modified the decision below and decreed the reinstatement
with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
despite the clear existence of a valid ground for termination.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that respondent NLRC ordered the reinstatement
with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
because it consi­dered her dismissal as illegal for want of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could not find evidence showing the
petitioner's subs­tantial, or at least minimum, compliance with the procedure
set forth in the rules implementing BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 130, the
perti­nent provisions of which state:</p>

<p class="BODY">In its memorandum filed with this Court, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1986</st1:date>, the petitioner
admitted that it failed to comply with the mandated requirements of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 130.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp.
126-127, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> rationalized its omission by
stating that a cloud of bias would have engulfed the process had it been
resorted to and that it would merely be one of formality, a farce and a mockery
of the procedural require­ments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner may have had some reasons for not complying with the procedures
outlined in the law but these are not sufficient to detract from the necessity
of basic fair play.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of an employee without any formal investigation is
unwarranted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The due process require­ment
is not a mere formality that may be dispensed with at will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its disregard is a matter of serious concern
since it constitutes a safeguard of the highest order in response to man's
innate sense of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Miguel v.
National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 78993, June 22, 1988)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear in Section 1, Rule XIV - Implementing Regulations of
the Labor <span class="GramE">Code, that</span> "No worker shall be
dismissed except for a just or authorized cause provided by law and after due
process."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the two facets of this legal provision as discussed by this
Court in an earlier case (<span class="SpellE">Primero</span> v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 156 SCRA 436 [1987]), are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the legality of the act of dismissal; that is dismissal under the
grounds provided for under Article 283 of the New Labor Code and (b) the
legality in the manner of dismissal; that is with due observance of the
procedural requirements of Sections 2, 5 and 6 of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
130.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conversely, illegality of the act of dismissal cons­titutes
discharge without just case, while illegality in the manner of dismissal is
dismissal without due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the Labor Code treats the nature of and the remedies
available as regards the first which are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) reinstatement to his former position without loss of seniority
rights and (2) payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> corres­ponding to
the period from his illegal dismissal up to actual reinstatement (Article 279,
Labor Code; DM <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Pucan</span>,
159 SCRA 113 [1988]), said Code does not deal at all with the second, that is
the manner of the dismissal, which is therefore governed exclusively by the
Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Primero</span>
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, <u>supra</u>)</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the decisive issue which arises is whether or not
the denial of due process under the cir­cumstances of this case makes the
dismissal for just cause <span class="GramE">so</span> arbitrary and illegal as
to warrant reinstate­ment and payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it appears that <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> failed
to observe due process in the termination of <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span>
employment, the clearly apparent conclusion in this case is that respondent <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> is not entirely without fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was grossly remiss in her duties toward
her employer, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shown by her frequent,
prolonged and unexplained absences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was intermittently absent from September 30, 1981 to October 14, 1981 and from
October 21, 1981 until the pre</span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">sent complaint for illegal dismissal was
filed on October 7, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And while
there might have been occasions when petitioner was apprised of the reasons for
her non-appearance (e.g., Exhibit E, Letter to <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span>
dated August 10, 1982 with copy of the death certificate of <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span>
father), the fact remains that from May 30, 1982 and onwards to October 7,
1983, there was absolutely no communication from her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 11-12, Private Respondent's Memorandum)<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We note that <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was earlier dismissed,
also for abandonment, but was allowed to work while the first case was pending
before the labor arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was
likewise misrepresentation if not deception because on <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1982</st1:date> the respondent filed an
application for maternity leave stating that <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1982</st1:date> or the following day was her expected
date of delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This expected date was
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">supported by a medical certificate
giving </span><st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">May 15, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
</span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">as
her last menstrual period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost two
months from the expected date or on </span></span><st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">April
 15, 1982</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> sent word
that the baby had not yet been delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Labor Arbiter not only found the delay "unusual" but the
alleged mis­carriage of that same child on </span></span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="8"><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:
 12.0pt">August 4, 1982</span></span></st1:date><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt"> was declared "highly unbelievable and
improbable." (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Otherwise stated, the
petitioner was justified in assuming that <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was
no longer interested in resuming her employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Abandonment" of work is
manifest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>can not be said that
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was not aware of the consequences of her acts
under the circumstances of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner cannot be faulted for not continuing <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
in her employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the final analysis, respondent <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was afforded due process although belatedly before the Labor Arbiter and then
before the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we have ruled, the
purpose of the law is to insure that the employer's prerogative to dismiss or
lay-off an employee is exercised without abuse of discretion or
arbitrariness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings before
the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission have upheld this
guarantee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rights of the employee
have been effectively safeguarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Piedad</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte
Electric Cooperative Inc., 153 SCRA 511 [1987])</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, <span class="SpellE">Shoemart</span> generously reinstated
her while the first case was pending.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the events that trans­pired <span class="GramE">thereafter,</span>
proved without question, that she is an inveterate absentee who does not
deserve reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In a recent case (<span class="SpellE">Wenphil</span>
Corporation v.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>National Labor
Relations Commission and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>, G.R. No.
80587, February 8, 1989), under circumstances similar to the case at bar, this
Court, without condoning the employer's failure to extend to an employee his
right to an investigation before causing his dismissal, sustained the dismissal
of the respondent employee where his dismissal was found to be for just and
authorized cause in an appropriate proceeding in the Ministry of Labor and
Employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, said the Court,
"It will be highly prejudicial to the interests of the employer to impose
on him the services of an employee who has been shown to be guilty of the
charges that warranted his dismissal from employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it will demoralize the rank and file
if the undeserving, if not undesirable remains in the service (<span class="SpellE">Wenphil</span> Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission,
et al., <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure to observe the procedural requirements, a sanction
was imposed by this Court on the employer to indemnify the dismissed
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was held however, that the
measure of the award depends on the facts of each case and the gravity of the
omission committed by the employer (ibid).</p>

<p class="BODY">We take into account the following circumstances stressed by the
petitioner in its memorandum:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Private Respondent was absent from work from <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1982</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1983</st1:date> or a period of one (1) year, four
