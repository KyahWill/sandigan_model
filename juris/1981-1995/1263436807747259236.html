				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Decision of the Second Division of this Court promulgated
April 22, 1992 (208 SCRA 215) dismissing, for lack of merit, these two <span style="">(2) </span>consolidated petitions, is assailed
by petitioners in their separate motions for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The assailed Decision states:</p>

<blockquote>With<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this Court's ruling
promulgated in 1984, it is our considered view that the petitioners can not
raise anew the question of ownership of Lucia de la Cruz over Lot 671 which had
been determined by the Court of Appeals and affirmed by the Supreme Court in
the <u>de la Cruz case</u>.  Well-settled is the rule enunciated in <u>Church Assistance Program,
Inc. v. Sibulo</u>, 171 SCRA 408 [1989] that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction, so long as it remains unreversed, it
should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or
estate."</p>

<blockquote>The Court's ruling has long been final and the issue on ownership
of Lot 671 finally disposed of several years ago.  This declaration must be respected and followed in the instant
case applying the principle of <i>res judicata </i>or, otherwise, the rule on
conclusiveness of judgment.  The less
familiar concept of less terminological usage of <i>res </i><i><span style="">judicata </span></i>as a rule on
conclusiveness of judgment refers to the situation where the judgment in the
prior action operates as an estoppel only as to the matters actually determined
therein or which were necessarily included therein.  (<u>De la Cruz v. Court of Appeals</u>, 187 SCRA 165 [1990]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Inevitably, the <u>de la Cruz</u> ruling should be applied to the
present petitions since the facts on which such decision was predicated
continue to be the facts of the case before us now (See <u>Rivas v. SEC</u>,
190 SCRA 295 [1990]).  Even the
petitioners substantially adopt the same findings of facts in their
pleadings.  The factual inquiry with
regards to the history of Lot 671 has already been laid to rest and may no
longer be disturbed ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>In our capacity as the court of last resort, the petitioners try to
convince us to look or inquire into the validity of the reconstitution
proceedings initiated by Lucia dela Cruz, contending that the implementation of
<u>de la Cruz</u> ruling would deprive them of their properties without due
process of law.  We have looked long and
hard into the records of the case but the facts and circumstances plus law and
jurisprudence on the matter do not warrant such action from the Court.  INK's title over Lot 671 which necessarily
included Lot 671-A had already become incontrovertible and indefeasible.  To reopen or to question the legality of
INK's title would defeat the purpose of our Torrens system which seeks to
insure stability by quieting titled lands and putting to a stop forever any
question of the legality of the registration <span style="">in </span>the certificate or questions which may arise therefrom.  (<u>de la Cruz v. de la Cruz</u>, <u>supra</u>.)
In fairness to INK, as registered owner it is entitled to rest secure in its
land title.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, it would be for the public interest
and the maintenance of the integrity and stability of the Torrens system of
land registration that all transfer certificates of title derived from the
reconstituted title of Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz be annulled in
order to prevent the proliferation of derivative titles which are null and
void.  The legality or validity of INK's
title over Lot 671 has been settled.  The Court has spoken and it has done so with finality, logically and
rightly so as to assure stability in legal relations and avoid confusion.  (See <u>Ver v. Quetulio</u>, 163 SCRA 80
[1988]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 224-225; 229-230.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 76265, petitioners seek a reconsideration of the
aforesaid decision because allegedly, the same is contrary to the following
settled principles of law and doctrines laid down by this Court, to wit:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. That a judgment rendered in an action <u>in personam</u> binds
only the parties to the action;</p>

<p class="NUM">2. That a petition for "reconstitution" of a certificate
of title filed in 1971, thirty years after the sale to respondent Lucia de la
Cruz in 1941, without personal notice to petitioners and other title holders of
Lot 671-A, whose titles date from 1952, is void and can be collaterally attacked;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. That the registration of the sale to respondent Lucia de la
Cruz in the Primary Entry Book of the Register of Deeds of Manila in 1943 of a
land located in Caloocan, Rizal, cannot be the operative act to convey said
property to the vendee, as the record of the title to said property was then in
Pasig, Rizal and then transferred to Quezon City, after the war;</p>

<p class="NUM">4. That the indefeasibility of a Torrens title after one year from
issuance, refers to the indefeasibility of a decree of registration after one year
from entry thereof in an original registration or cadastral proceeding, and by
analogy, the principle is extended to a patent issued in an administrative
proceeding, but not to a reconstitution of a certificate of title allegedly
lost, nor to the issuance of subsequent transfer certificate of title; and</p>

<p class="NUM">5. That respondent Iglesia ni Kristo cannot be considered as an
innocent purchaser for value as far as petitioners and other title holders to
Lot 671-A are concerned, because the titles of respondent Iglesia ni Kristo are
derived from the "reconstituted" title of respondent Lucia de la Cruz
issued in 1971.  Respondent Iglesia ni
Kristo is deemed to have actual and constructive knowledge of the rights of more
than 80 buyers of Lot 671-A who were issued transfer certificates of title
dating from 1952.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 83280, petitioners assail the decision on the
following grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The decision in the <u>de la Cruz</u> case does not bind the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. The Iglesia ni Kristo, represented by public respondent, is not
an innocent purchaser for value of the parcels of land in dispute.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Petitioners, as duly registered owners of land under the
Torrens system, are purchasers in good faith whose titles have become
indefeasible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aware of the importance of the case, the Court granted the
request of petitioners to have their motions for reconsideration be considered
by the Court en banc.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the core of the controversy is the case of <u>Agustina de la
Cruz et al. vs. Lucia de la Cruz, Iglesia ni Kristo and Hon. Court of Appeals</u>
(130 SCRA 666 [1984]) which has settled once and for all the question of
ownership of Lot 671 of the Piedad Estate in Barrio Culiat, Quezon City.  A portion of this lot, Lot 671-A, is the
subject of these two (2) consolidated petitions at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In said <u>de la Cruz case</u>, the Court found and held:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The mother title of Lot 671 is OCT No. 614 registered on March
12, 1912 in the name of the Philippine Government.  When Lot 671, with an area of 184,268 square meters, more or
less, was segregated the original title was partially cancelled and TCT-40355
T-201 was issued to Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz by virtue of Entry
No. 3241 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>…. Vendido a Eugenia de la Paz y Dorotea de la Paz y Dorotea de la
Cruz el Lote NO. 671 del terreno en este certificado de titulo, mediante
escritura ratificada al 27 de Julio de 1931 en Manila, ante Vicente Garcia,
Notario Publico; se cancela parcialmente al presente certificado de titulo, en
cuanto al lote mencianado y se expide otro a nombre de las compradoras con el
No. 40355, folio 5, Tomo T-201 del libro de transferencias; archivandose la
escritura de que se ha hecho referencia en el Legajo T-No. 40355.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. On November 29, 1941, Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz
sold Lot 671 to Lucia de la Cruz and TCT No. 40355 T-201 was cancelled by
virtue of Entry No. 258, Page 7, Volume 7, Primary Entry Book of the Registry
of Deeds of Manila.  Said entry reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>1.  Number of Entry…………<span style=""> </span>258</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">3.  In 1971, Lucia de la
Cruz petitioned for the reconstitution of her title in the Court of First
Instance of Manila.  The court granted
the petition and the Register of Deeds of Manila issued to her TCT No. RT-58,
thereby cancelling TCT 40355 T-201.  (at
p. 698.)</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The petition for reconstitution was duly published and proper
notices posted in accordance with law; and after <span style="">due hearing, was granted by the court in the exercise of its authority
and jurisdiction.  </span><span style="">"Hence, We reject petitioners' assignment
</span><span style="">of error that the Court of Appeals
erred in not declaring that the reconstituted title of Lucia de la Cruz is
absolutely null and void." (at p. 698.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">5. "With respect to the reconstituted title of Dorotea de la
Cruz which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal on December 14,
1945 and TCT 5284 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City was issued in
substitution and/or reconstitution of TCT 40355 of the Register of Deeds of
Rizal, ... it may be true that the order granting reconstitution was null and
void by reason of the failure to cause the necessary publication of the
petition, and, therefore, the reconstituted title <span style="">was </span>ineffective.  More
than that, it is established that Dorotea de la Cruz and Eugenia de la Paz had
previously sold the land to Lucia de la Cruz on November 29, 1941 as indicated
in Entry No. 258 so that Dorotea de la Cruz was no longer the owner at the time
she petitioned for reconstitution." (at pp. 298-699.)</p>

<p class="NUM">6. "Nonetheless, it is not disputed that Dorotea de la Cruz
together with Eugenia de la Paz were the registered owners of Lot 671 under TCT
40355, T-201 of the Register of Deeds of Rizal and they could legally transfer
the same to Lucia de la Cruz who thereafter sold in favor of Iglesia ni
Kristo." (at p. 699.)</p>

<p class="NUM">7. Under Section 38 of the Land Registration Act, "the
registered title of Lucia de la Cruz reconstituted as TCT No. RT-58 in 1971
became indefeasible and incontrovertible one year from its issuance.  As registered owner, Lucia de la Cruz had
the perfect and legal right to sell, assign, and convey the property to
respondent Iglesia ni Kristo who as purchaser for value in good faith holds the
same free from all encumbrances except those noted in said certificate (Sec. 39
Land Registration Act).  The Iglesia may
then safely rely on the correctness of the certificate of title issued therefor
and the law will in no way oblige him to go behind the certificate to determine
the condition of the property".  (at p. 703.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled that once a decision becomes final, the
Court can no longer amend, modify, much less, set aside the same <span style="">(<u>Adez Realty Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</u>,
</span>212 SCRA 625 [1992]); otherwise, endless litigation will result <span style="">(<u>Fabular vs. Court of Appeals</u>, </span>119
SCRA 329 [1982]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, in <u><span style="">Duenas vs.
Mandi</span></u><span style=""> </span>(151 SCRA 530
[1987]) cited in <u><span style="">Adez</span></u><span style="">, </span>we held that the trial court and the
appellate court may have committed error in the assignment or partition of the
eight (8) parcels of land to the parties in said case, but considering that
their judgments are already final, the error, assuming one was committed, can
no longer be amended or corrected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="">Icao vs. Apalisok</span></u><span style=""> </span>(180 SCRA 680 [1989]), likewise cited
in <u><span style="">Adez</span></u><span style="">, </span>we ruled that even the subsequent
discovery of an erroneous imposition of a penalty will not justify correction
of the judgment after it has become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our decision in these two consolidated petitions is an
application of this well-established rule, that once a decision becomes final,
the Court can no longer modify, amend, much less, set aside the same.  <span style="">To
grant a </span>reconsideration of this decision would also reconsider, reverse,
and set aside our 1984 decision which has long become final.  For, while the 1984 decision declared the
reconstituted title RT-58 of Lucia de la Cruz valid and legal, petitioners
would want us to reach 10 years back and declare the same title null and void;
while the 1984 decision declared the Iglesia ni Kristo a purchaser in good
faith and for value, petitioners would want us to do a complete turn around and
find the Iglesia ni Kristo a purchaser in bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u><span style="">Legarda
vs. Savellano</span></u><span style=""> </span>(158
SCRA 194 [1988]) the Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>... It is a general rule common to all civilized system of
jurisprudence, that the solemn and deliberate sentence of the law, pronounced
by its appointed organs, upon a disputed fact or a state <span style="">of </span>facts, should be regarded as a
final and conclusive determination of the question litigated, and should
forever set the controversy at rest.  Indeed, it has been well said that this maxim is more than a mere rule
of law, more than an important principle of public policy; and that it is not
too much to say that it is a fundamental concept in the organization of every
jural system.  Public policy and sound
practice demand that at the risk of occasional errors, judgments of courts
should become final at some definite date fixed by law.  The very object for which courts were
constituted was to put an end to controversies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If we were to allow repeated suits seeking to nullify OCT Nos.
1348-1355 issued to Benito Legarda, Sr. in 1907, the indefeasibility of titles
issued under the Torrens system and land registration, which the Philippines
has adopted, will be defeated and set to naught.  (at p. 200.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, speaking through Justice Nocon, in <u>Swan vs. Court
of Appeals</u> (212 SCRA 114 [1992]) stated:</p>

<blockquote>It is high time that we write <u>finis</u> to a litigation that has
been pending for years not only to the prejudice of the prevailing parties, but
also to the prompt determination of controversies, and in violation of the
fundamental concept that public policy and sound practice demand that judgments
of courts shall become final at some definite date fixed by law.  (at p. 124.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the <u>dela Cruz case</u> is not
applicable and that the doctrine of <i>res judicata </i>should not have been
applied.  We do not agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine <i>res judicata</i> actually embraces two different
concepts:  (1) bar by former judgment
and (b) conclusiveness of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second concept -- conclusiveness of judgment -- states that a
fact or question which was in issue in a former suit and was there judicially
passed upon and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, is
conclusively settled by the judgment therein as far as the parties to that
action and persons in privity with them are concerned and cannot be again
litigated in any future action between such parties or their privies, in the
same court or any other court of concurrent jurisdiction on either the same or
different cause of action, while the judgment remains unreversed by proper authority.  It has been held that in order that a
judgment in one action can be conclusive as to a particular matter in another
action between the same parties or their privies, it is essential that the
issue be identical.  If a particular
point or question is in issue in the second action, and the judgment will
depend on the determination of that particular point or question, a former
judgment between the same parties or their privies will be final and conclusive
in the second if that same point or question was in issue and adjudicated in
the first suit (<u>Nabus vs. Court of Appeals</u>, 193 SCRA 732 [1991]).  Identity of cause of action is not required
but merely identity of issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Feliciano, in <u>Smith Bell &amp; Company (Phils.), Inc.
vs. Court of Appeals</u> (197 SCRA 201, 210 [1991]), reiterated <u>Lopez vs.
Reyes</u> (76 SCRA 179 [1977]) in regard to the distinction between bar by
former judgment which bars the prosecution of a second action upon the same
claim, demand, or cause of action, and conclusiveness of judgment which bars
the relitigation of particular facts or issues in another litigation between
the same parties on a different claim or cause of action.</p>

<blockquote>The general rule precluding the relitigation of material facts or
questions which were in issue and adjudicated in former action are commonly
applied to all matters essentially connected with the subject matter of the
litigation.  Thus, it extends to
questions necessarily implied in the final judgment, although no specific finding
may have been made in reference thereto and although such matters were directly
referred to in the pleadings and were not actually or formally presented.  Under this rule, if the record of the former
trial shows that the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding the
particular matter, it will be considered as having settled that matter as to
all future actions between the parties and if a judgment necessarily
presupposes certain premises, they are as conclusive as the judgment itself ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>(at pp. 186-187.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issue of the validity of the reconstituted title of Lucia de
la Cruz over Lot 671 of the Piedad Estate, the issue of whether or not the
Iglesia ni Kristo was an innocent purchaser for value and in good faith, and
the issue of the validity of the reconstituted title of Dorotea de la Cruz and
Eugenia de la Paz (herein petitioners' predecessors-in-interest) were actually,
directly, and expressly raised, controverted, litigated and resolved in our
1984 decision.  Applying the rule on conclusiveness
of judgment, these issues may no longer be relitigated in these present
petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners cannot evade the conclusive effect of the 1984
decision, merely because they were not impleaded parties <span style="">in </span>the said case.  It has been said that the foundation
principle upon which the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> rests is that parties
ought not to be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once; that, when
a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the
judgment of the court, so long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive
upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate.  (<u>Nabus vs. Court of Appeals</u>, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <u>Vda. de Medina vs. Cruz</u> (161 SCRA 36
[1988]), the Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>The crucial issue in this case is whether or not the decision in
Civil Case No. C-120 which has long become final and executory can be enforced
against the petitioner who is not a party to the aforementioned case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioner alleged in her memorandum that she is not affected by
the decision in C-120 as persons who are not parties to a suit are not bound by
the judgment and that she purchased the lot in good faith from an entirely
different person -- the Heirs of Don Mariano San Pedro y Esteban and not from
either the plaintiffs or defendants of the aforesaid case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is a generally accepted principle "that no man shall be
affected by any proceeding to which he is a stranger ..."</blockquote>

<blockquote>[but] being a privy, the petitioner can be reached by the order of
execution and Writ of Demolition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(at pp. 43-44.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Also, in the case of <u>Varsity Hills, Inc. vs. Navarro</u> (43
SCRA 503 [1972]), the Court ruled:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In the face of these declarations in a final decision of the
highest Court of the land, it becomes indubitable that the action in the court
below was definitely barred:  for while
present private respondents were not parties in the 1993 cause, their
predecessor-in- interest Quintin Mejia was such a party and the final judgment
against him concludes and bars his successors and privies as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(at pp. 510-511.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, petitioners derived their title from Amando Clemente
and/or Clemville Subdivision.  Amando
Clemente derived his title from Dorotea de la Cruz and Eugenia de la Paz.  Being privies and/or successors in interest
to the parties in the 1984 decision, petitioners are bound by said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise untenable is petitioners' contention that the
reconstituted title of Lucia de la Cruz, RT-58, is void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Proceedings for judicial reconstitution or certificates of title
are proceedings <i><span style="">in rem.  </span></i>Thus, notice of hearing by proper
publication is sufficient to clothe the Court with jurisdiction and the mere
fact that a person purporting to have a legitimate claim in the property did
not receive personal notice is not sufficient ground to invalidate the
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Adez Realty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</u> (212 SCRA 625
[1992]), the Court, through Justice Bellosillo, held:</p>

<blockquote>Besides, as early as 1910, in <u>Grey Alba v. de la Cruz</u> (17
Phil. 41) We already ruled that land registration proceedings are proceedings <u>in
rem</u>, not <u>in personam</u>, and therefore it is not necessary to give
personal notice to the owners or claimants of the land sought to be registered,
in order to vest the courts with power and authority over the <i><span style="">res.  </span></i>Thus,
while, it may be true that no notice was sent by registered mail to petitioners
when the judicial reconstitution of title was sought, such failure, however,
did not amount to a jurisdictional defect.  (See PNR v. De la Vina &amp; Zamacona, 109 Phil. 342).  In <u>Register of Deeds of Malabon vs. RTC,
Malabon, Metro Manila, Br. 170</u> (G.R. No. 88623, February 5, 1990, 181 SCRA
788), We said that "the purpose of the publication of the notice of the petition
for reconstitution in the Official Gazette is to apprise the whole world that
such a petition has been filed and that whoever is minded to oppose it for good
cause may do so within thirty (30) days before the date set by the court for
hearing the petition.  It is the
publication of such notice that brings in the whole word as a party in the case
and vests the court with jurisdiction to hear and decide it." Thus, notice
of hearing by proper publication in the Official Gazette is sufficient to
clothe the court with jurisdiction, and the mere fact that a person purporting
to have a legitimate claim in the property did not receive personal notice is
not sufficient ground to invalidate the proceedings.  (at p. 628.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the official records of the Quezon City Municipal Hall,
as certified to by the Office of the City Assessor of Quezon City (pp. 456-556,
Rollo of G.R. No. 83280) show that there are no improvements whatsoever on the
property in question thus signifying that the property is unoccupied.   Therefore, it would have been impossible for
Lucia de la Cruz to notify petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Be this as it may, the issue of the validity of the 1971
reconstitution proceedings is no longer a valid issue in these petitions at
bar, its validity having already been resolved with finality in the 1984
decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the registration of the November 29, 1941
sale by Dorotea de la Cruz and Eugenia de la Paz to Lucia de la Cruz, with the
Register of Deeds of Manila is irregular deserves scant consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">As certified to by the Administrator of the Land Registration
Authority (p. 448, Rollo of G.R. No. 83280) the City of Manila and the nearby
towns and cities were treated as a single political unit, that is Greater
Manila, during the Japanese Occupation.   Thus, the Excerpts from Volume 7 of the Registry Book of Manila,
year 1943 (p. 447, Rollo of G.R. No. 83280), show, among other things, the
following entries:</p>

<blockquote>(c) The sale of a
parcel of land located in Quezon City executed by Magdalena Estates, Inc. in favor
of Dionisio Bravo;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The mortgage of
a parcel of land in Quezon City by Antonio Zuzuareggui in favor of Elena
Africa, et al.; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) The sale of a
parcel of land in Quezon City to Lucia de la Cruz by Dorotea de la Cruz, et al.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">clearly indicating that transactions
involving parcels of land located in Quezon City were indeed recorded and
registered in the Registry of Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the law, it is the act of registration of the deed of
conveyance that serves as the operative act to convey the land registered under
the Torrens system.  The act of
registration creates constructive notice to the whole world of the fact of such
conveyance.  (<u>Quilisadio vs. Court of
Appeals</u>, 182 SCRA 401 [1990]; <u>De la Calzada-Cierras vs. Court of Appeals</u>,
212 SCRA 390 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot go along with petitioners' position that their titles,
because they were issued in 1952, must prevail over the title of the Iglesia ni
Kristo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The titles issued to petitioners are derived from TCT No.
5284.  This title, TCT No. 5284, is the
reconstituted title of Dorotea de la Cruz which was declared null and void in
the 1984 decision.</p>

<blockquote>3.  With respect to the reconstituted title of
Dorotea de la Cruz which was granted by the Court of First Instance of Rizal on
December 14, 1945 and TCT 5284 of the Register of Deeds of Quezon City was
issued in substitution and/or reconstitution of TCT 40355 of the Register of
Deeds of Rizal by virtue of the following inscription on TCT 40335, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Se expide otra copia para el dueno del presente certificado de titulo
en sustitucion del duplicado que se alega haberse quemado, en virtud de na
orden del juzgado de Primera Instancia de Rizal dictada el 14 de Deciembre,
1945, en Expediente G.L.R.O. Rec. No. 5975, y en donde se declara nulo y
ninguna valor dicho duplicado quemado.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt 1.5in; text-align: center; text-indent: 0in;" align="center">MAMERTO
TINGKUNGKO</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 0in 0.6in 0.0001pt 1.5in; text-align: center; text-indent: 0in;" align="center">Register
of Deeds Interino</p>

<blockquote>it may be true that the order granting
reconstitution was null and void by reason of the failure to cause the
necessary publication of the petition, and, therefore, the reconstituted title
was ineffective.  More than that, it is
established that Dorotea de la Cruz and Eugenia de la Paz had previously sold
the land to Lucia de la Cruz executed on November 29, 1941 as indicated in
Entry No. 258 so that Dorotea de la Cruz was no longer the owner at the time
she petitioned for reconstitution.  Nonetheless, it is not disputed that Dorotea de la Cruz together with
Eugenia de la Paz were the registered owners of Lot 671 under TCT 40355, T-201
of the Register of Deeds of Rizal, and they could legally transfer the same to
Lucia de la Cruz who thereafter sold in favor of respondent Iglesia ni Kristo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(at pp. 698-699.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Needless to state, all subsequent certificates of title including
petitioners' titles are also void because of the legal truism that the spring
cannot rise higher than its source.  (<u>De
Santos vs. Intermediate Appellate Court</u>, 157 SCRA 295 [1988].) The law must
protect and prefer the lawful holder of registered title over the transferee of
a vendor bereft of any transmissible rights (<u>Baltazar </u><u><span style="">vs. </span>Court of Appeals</u>, 168 SCRA 354
[1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, both petitions are procedurally erroneous because <i>certiorari</i>
is not the proper remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 76265 stemmed from a letter in <u>consulta</u> addressed
by the then Acting Register of Deeds of Quezon City to the Administrator of the
National Land Titles and Deeds Registration Administration involving the
registrability of a deed of sale presented for registration by Mr. Constancio
Simangan.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Administrator issued a resolution dated April 4, 1988
ordering the Register of Deeds to register the deed of sale subject of the
consulta.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Register of Deeds moved for reconsideration.  Herein petitioner Virginia Calalang moved to
intervene.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Acting Administrator denied both motions.  Calalang filed a motion for reconsideration
but the same was denied, and forthwith, Calalang filed the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proper remedy available to Calalang is an appeal to the Court
of Appeals pursuant to Section 117 of Presidential Decree No. 1529 and Republic
Act No. 5434, and not <i>certiorari</i> or prohibition. </p>

<blockquote>Sec. 117, PD 1529 (Property Registration Decree) Procedure - x x x
the party in interest who disagrees with the final resolution, ruling or order
of the Commission relative to the consultas may appeal to the Court of Appeals
within the period and in the manner provided in Republic Act No. 5434.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 2, RA 5434 (Uniform Procedure for Appeals) Appeals to Court of
Appeals.  - Appeals to the Court of
Appeals shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the ruling,
award, order, decision or judgment or from the date of its last publication, if
publication is required by law for its effectivity; x x x.  If no appeal is filed within the periods
here fixed, the ruling, award, order, decision or judgment shall become final
and may be executed as provided by existing law.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other case, G.R. No. 83280, stemmed from an injunction suit
filed by Augusto de Leon et al. against the Iglesia ni Kristo and Bishop
Manalo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case was dismissed by the Regional Trial Court.  Instead of appealing the order of dismissal,
petitioners filed with the Court of Appeals the following.</p>

<blockquote>1.  A "Motion for
Reconsideration Ad Cautelam"; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  An "Omnibus Motion Incident to
Execution of the Decision"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals denied both motions.  Hence, the other herein petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is elementary that a petition for <i>certiorari</i> can not
substitute for a lost appeal.  The order
of the Regional Trial Court dismissing the case was appealable.  Petitioners in the second petition failed to
appeal the same, consequently the order has already become final and may no
longer be reviewed on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, these petitions amount to a collateral attack on the
title of the Iglesia ni Kristo.  Well-settled is the rule that a certificate of title cannot be altered,
modified or cancelled except in a direct proceeding in accordance <span style="">with law.  (Section 48, PD No. 1529.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING</b>, petitioners' Motion for
Reconsiderations are hereby DENIED.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although I originally voted with the majority in the challenged
Decision of 22 April 1992, in the light of the clearer presentation of the
procedural and factual antecedents by the parties in the motion for reconsideration
and the opposition thereto and the pleadings they thereafter filed, as well as
in their expositions during the oral arguments on the said motion and
opposition, I am convinced that cogent reasons exist for the reconsideration of
the challenged decision and the rendition of another dismissing, nevertheless,
these petitions on other grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot No. 671 of the Piedad Estate, with an area of 184,268 sq.
meters, was originally registered in the name of the Philippine Government
which was issued Original Certificate of Title No. 614.  Although Lot No. 671 was in the possession
of Policarpio de la Cruz who was given priority or preference in its
acquisition, it appears that he sold it to Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la
Cruz as evidenced by Entry No. 3241; accordingly, a new title, Transfer
Certificate o<span style="">f </span>Title (TCT) No.
40355, was <span style="">issued to the said vendees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 November 1941, Dorotea and Eugenia sold Lot No. 671 to
Lucia de <span style="">la Cruz.  </span>Although Lucia appears to have filed
with the Office of the Register of Deeds on 17 July 1943 the deed of sale in
her favor, which was entered as Entry No. 258 on 17 July 1943 <span style="">as </span>shown on page 7, volume 7, Primary
Entry Book of the Registry of Deeds of Manila, there is no showing at all that
she also presented to the Register of Deeds the owner's duplicate copy of TCT
No. 40355.  On the contrary, the said
owner's copy of the title remained in the possession of the vendors, Eugenia
and Dorotea, because their deed of sale <span style="">in
favor of Amando Clemente </span>for P178,556.40 of a portion of Lot No. 671,
described as Lot No. 671-A with an area of 81,160 sq. meters, is the last
inscription in <span style="">the series of
transactions annotated at the back of </span>TCT No. <span style="">40355.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence of the registration of the deed of sale in favor
of Clemente, and considering <span style="">that </span>Eugenia
and Dorotea had earlier subdivided Lot No. 671 into Lot No. 671-A and Lot <span style="">No. </span>671-B with the latter having an
area of 103,108 sq. meters, <span style="">TCT </span><span style="">No. 40355 was cancelled and TCT No. 16212 and
TCT No. 16213 were issued for Lot </span>No. 671-A and Lot No. 671-B,
respectively.  Lot No. <span style="">671-B was later sold by Eugenia and </span>Dorotea
to Narcisa de L<span style="">e</span>on, as a
consequence of which TCT No. 16213 was cancelled and a new<span style=""> </span>TCT No. 2009 was issued to the
vendee.  On 6 May 1964, N<span style="">a</span>rcisa de Leon sold Lot No. 671-B to
Nieves Paz Ereña to whom was issued TCT No. 79971.  The latter's action to quiet title against Lucia de la Cruz ended
in a compromise settlement under which Lucia paid Nieves the sum of P25,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amando Clemente further subdivided Lot No. 671-A and sold the
subdivided lots in 1952 to various vendees, among whom are the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1971, Lucia de la Cruz obtained a reconstituted title, RT-58,
over Lot No. 671.  She then sub-divided
the lot into Lot No. 671-A with an area of 30,000 sq. meters, Lot No. 671-B
with an area of 4,268 sq. meters, and Lot No. 671-C with an area of 150,000 sq.
meters, as a consequence of which TCT Nos. 168320, 168321, and 168322 were
issued for the subdivided lots, respectively.  On 17 July 1975, Lucia de la Cruz sold to the <i style=""><span style="">Iglesia Ni Kristo</span></i><span style=""> </span>(INK) a
portion of Lot No. 671-C with an area of 103,108 sq. meters.  Another deed of sale was executed by Lucia
in favor of the INK for the remaining 84,356 sq. meters and the transaction was
annotated in TCT No. 168322.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing it would thus appear that there was a <u><span style="">double</span></u><span style=""> <u>sale </u></span>of Lot No. 671 by Eugenia and Dorotea, first to
Lucia de la Cruz and then to Amando Clemente (Lot No. 671-A) and Narcisa de
Leon (Lot No. 671-B).  The rights then
of the two sets of vendees would be determined pursuant to Article 1544 of the
Civil Code which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. 1544.  </span>If the same thing should have been
sold to different vendees, the ownership shall be transferred to the person who
may have first taken possession thereof in good faith, if it should be movable
property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should it be immovable property, the ownership shall belong to the
person acquiring it who in good faith first recorded it in the Registry of
Property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should there be no inscription, the ownership shall pertain to the
person who in good faith was first in the possession; and in the absence
thereof, to the person who presents the oldest title, provided there is good
faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be presumed that
both sets of vendees were in good </span>faith <span style="">in </span>the purchase <span style="">of the
immovable in question.  As </span>to <span style="">who of </span>them first registered the sale
in the Registry of Deeds is the more crucial issue.  Although there is evidence that the sale in favor of Lucia de la
Cruz was entered in the primary entry book of the Registry of Deeds of Manila on
17 July 1943, the owner's copy of TCT No. 40355 was not presented to the said
office.  For that reason, the sale was
not annotated on TCT No. 40355 and, thus, no new TCT was issued to Lucia.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this jurisdiction under the Land Registration Act (Act
<span style="">No. 496) is </span>that in <u><span style="">voluntary</span></u><span style=""> </span>dealings with registered lands, the mere entry of the document
(<i>e.g.,</i> deed of sale) does not operate to convey and affect the land sold
unless the owner's duplicate copy of the certificate of title is surrendered
and the <span style="">fees paid.  Expounding thereon, in </span><i style=""><span style="">Villasor
vs. Camon</span></i><span style=""> </span>(89 Phil. 404, 407<span style="">-</span>412
[1951]), <span style="">this Court, thr</span><span style="">o</span>u<span style="">gh Mr. Justice Felicisimo Feria, made the following enlightening
disquisition on this rule </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">its non-applicability to involuntary dealings
with registered lands:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(a)  </span>The question raised in the third assignment of error which we
have to decide, is whether the mere registration by the Register of Deeds in
the entry or diary book of the exhibit <span style="">"A"
</span>in which the defendant Camon sold or assigned all his rights and
interests in the lot in question, without the presentation of the duplicate
certificate of the owner for the annotation of such assignment thereon and on
the original certificate, had the effect of a conveyance of the said lot to the
plaintiff and a notice thereof to all other persons <span style="">from </span>the time of such registering, filing, or entering, under
Sections 50 and 51 of Act No. 496.  These two sections provide only for the effect of registration of deeds,
mortgage, lease or other voluntary conveyance, as well as of lien, attachment,
notice of <i>lis pendens</i><span style=""> </span>and
other involuntary instruments on registered land.  But they do not provide for the requisites or conditions for such
registration in order to have that effect, which is provided for in the
subsequent sections of the same Act, which we shall quote later on in their
proper places depending upon whether the instrument to be registered is
voluntary or involuntary one.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A cursory examination of the provisions of Sections 52, 57, 61, and
64 of Act No. 496 and the decisions of this Court in the cases of Fidelity and
Surety Co. vs. Pastora Conegero, 41 <span style="">Phil.,
</span>396; Director of Lands vs. Addison, 49 <span style="">Phil., </span>19; and Philippine National Bank vs. Fernandez, 61 Phil.,

<p class="2Q">'Section 52 provides that "all interests in registered land less
than an estate in fee simple shall be registered by filing with the register of
deeds the instrument creating or transferring or claiming such interest and by
a brief memorandum thereof made by the register of deeds upon the certificate
of title, signed by him.  A similar
memorandum shall also be made on the owner's duplicate.  The cancellation or extinguishment of such
interests shall be registered in the same manner."</p>

<p class="2Q">Section 57 prescribes that "An owner desiring to convey in fee
his registered land or any portion thereof shall execute a deed of conveyance,
which the grantor or grantee may present to the register of deeds in the
province where the land lies.  The
grantor's duplicate certificate shall be produced and presented at the same
time.  * * * The register of deeds shall
note upon the original and duplicate certificates the date of transfer, the
volume and page of the registration book where the new certificate is
registered, and a reference by number to the last prior certificate."</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">Section 61 provides that
"Registration of a mortgage shall be made in the manner following, to
wit:  The owner's duplicate </span>certificate
shall be presented to the register of deeds with the mortgage deed, and he
shall enter upon the original certificate of title and also upon the owner's
duplicate certificate a memorandum of the purport of the mortgage deed, the
time of filing and the file number of the deed, and shall sign the
memorandum."</p>

<p class="2Q">Section 64 prescribes that "Lease of registered land shall be
registered in the manner provided in section fifty-two of this Act, in Lieu of
recording."</p>

<blockquote>This Supreme Court in the case of Fidelity and Surety Co., vs.
Pastora Conegero, 41 Phil., 401, held that 'The steps by which registration is
accomplished are fully set out in section 57 of the same Act; and by reference
thereto, it will be seen that registration of the transfer of registered land
depends upon several vital conditions, among which is the requirement that the
grantor's duplicate certificate, upon which the title is founded, shall be
produced before the register of deeds for cancellation; and that he shall also
have before him the original certificate, likewise to be cancelled.  This prerequisite condition was not complied
with when the deed to Thomas was presented for registration.  On the other hand, the conveyance of the
land covered by certificate No. 194, by way of mortgage to the Fidelity and
Surety Company, was effected in compliance with all legal requirements.  As a consequence it must be held that the
title acquired by the Fidelity and Surety Company is superior to that acquired
by Samuel Thomas.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of the Director of Lands vs. Addison, 49 Phil., 19, 26,
it was held that 'In fact the register of deeds has no authority to register a
conveyance in fee without the presentation of the conveyor's duplicate
certificate unless he is ordered to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction <span style="">(see </span>Land Registration Act, section
55).’</blockquote>

<blockquote>And in the case of Philippine National Bank vs. Fernandez, 61
Phil., 448, this Supreme Court ruled that, 'As to the share <span style="">of </span>Leonor Villaranda, appellant's deed
from her could not prejudice third persons, because it was not registered on
transfer certificate of title No. 2207 in the office of the register of deeds,
and the reason therefor was the failure of the appellant to present the owner's
duplicate of said certificate to the register of deeds, as required by section
55 of Act No. 496.  The appellant did
not therefore acquire any right to the issuance of a new transfer certificate
of title in his favor with respect to the interest of Leonor Villaranda
(Fidelity and Surety Co. vs. Conegero Vda. de Lizarraga, 41 Phil., 396;
Director of Lands vs. Addison, 49 Phil., 19).’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Niblack, in his well known book 'An Analysis of the Torrens System
of Conveying Land', has the following to say on the necessity of producing the
certificate of title:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Production of Certificate of Title with Instrument Affecting
Title.  -- Under the scheme of the
Torrens system, and as a protection to the registered owner, the certificate of
title must be produced with any voluntary instrument purporting to affect the
title.  In some acts it is expressly
provided that no new certificate of title shall be entered, and no memorandum
shall be made upon the register by the registrar, in pursuance of any voluntary
instrument, unless the owner's duplicate certificate is presented with such
instrument, except in cases specifically provided for in the act, or upon the
order of a court for cause shown.  The
other acts in this country provide that on the filing of such instrument and
the production of the owner's duplicate certificate, the transfer or memorial
may be registered.  It is evident that
under these acts the registrar has no authority to make registration without
the production of the certificate of title with the voluntary instrument.  Where there is no specific provision in an
act that the production of the owner's duplicate certificate is to be a
condition precedent to the right of the registrar to make a registration or a
memorial, such provision may be inferred from the other requirements or
statements of the act.  A requirement
that the owner's certificate shall be cancelled when a new registration is
made, or that a memorial, when registered, shall be noted on the duplicate
certificate, is an implication that the owner's duplicate must be presented
before a new registration may be made.' (Italics ours.)</p>

<blockquote>The appellant cannot invoke in support of her contention the ruling
laid down in the case of Government of the Philippine Islands vs. Aballe, 60
Phil. 986, which was followed in Director of Lands vs. Abad, 61 Phil., 479, to
the effect that an attachment entered upon the entry book is duly registered
although the duplicate certificate is not presented at the time of registration
to the register of deeds.  Appellant
cannot invoke said ruling, not because it has been abandoned by the Supreme
Court during the Japanese occupation in the case of Bass vs. De la Rama, et
al., (1, Off. Gaz., [12] p. 889), in which it was said that 'we are constrained
to abandon the ruling in said two cases,' -- it was not abandoned for the
decision was concurred by only two justices or less than a majority, and said
statement was not necessary or an <i style=""><span style="">obiter dictum</span></i><span style=""> </span>and
against the law, as correctly stated by the two associate justices who
dissented and only concurred in the result, but because said ruling, subsisting
and in force, does not support appellant's contention, for it is only
applicable to registration of involuntary instruments, such as attachment, or
other liens and adverse claims of any description.  This ruling is correct or in conformity with the provisions of
section 72 of Act No. 496, which do not require the production by the
registrant of the duplicate certificate of the land to be affected, and was
also followed in the case of National Bank vs. Fernandez quoted <i>supra</i>,
in which this Supreme Court in passing upon the second ground of appellant's
contention, held the following:'</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The reason for the difference between the conditions required for
the registration of a voluntary and that of an involuntary instrument, is
obvious.  The law requires the
production of the owner's duplicate certificate by the registrant by a
voluntary instrument together with the deed or instrument to be registered,
because as a voluntary instrument is a willful act of the registered owner of
the land to be affected by the registration, it is to be presumed that he is
interested in registering the instrument, and would willingly surrender,
present or produce his duplicate certificate of title to the register of deeds
in order to accomplish such registration.  And this is the reason why the second paragraph of Section 55 provides
that 'The production of the owner's duplicate certificate whenever any
voluntary instrument is presented for registration shall be conclusive
authority from the registered owner to the register of deeds to enter a new
certificate or to make a memorandum of registration in accordance with such
instrument.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>But in case of involuntary instrument such as an attachment, or
other lien or adverse claim of any description, as the registration thereof is
contrary to the interests of the registered owner or will affect him adversely,
it is but natural that he will not willingly present or produce his duplicate
certificate or at least delay his production as long as possible.  For that reason, the law does not require
its presentation together with the involuntary instrument, as in the case of
voluntary instrument, and considers the annotation of such instrument upon the
entry book as sufficient to affect the real estate to which it relates; <span style="">x x x." </span>(underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i style=""><span style="">Levin vs. Bass</span></i><span style=""> </span>(91 Phil. 419 [1952]), this Court, per Mr. <span style="">Justice Sabino Padilla, elucidated again on
the requirements of effective registration in voluntary dealings of registered
land:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We now take up the question between Eugenio Mintu and Rebecca
Levin.  Under the Torrens system the act
of registration is the operative act to convey and affect the land. [Sec. 50,

of the trial court that the registration of plaintiff's deed of sale is
incomplete and cannot prevail over the rights of defendants who had secured
registration of the deed of sale in their favor and the issuance of a
certificate of title in their name.  The
above conclusion is also correct.  In
the first place, the act of registration is the operative act to convey and
affect the land, an unregistered deed only operating as a contract between the
parties and as evidence of authority to the register of deeds to make
registration (Sec. 50, Land Registration Act.) The registration of defendants
Padillas' deed affected the <span style="">land

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To </span>recapitulate,
since Lucia de la Cruz was not able to <span style="">present
to the Register of Deeds the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 40355 which had
all the time remained in the possession </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">her vendors until it
was cancelled upon the registration of the deed of sale in favor of Amando
Clemente, she cannot claim any better right </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">the property against
the second vendees simply because she was the first to present her deed of sale
to the Register of Deeds.  On the ot</span><span style="">h</span><span style="">er
hand, Clemente registered the deed of sale in his favor in August of 1951 or <u>twenty</u>
<u>(20)</u> <u>years</u> before Lucia de la Cruz secured a reconstituted title over
Lot No. 671.  The compromise agreement
between Ereña and Lucia de </span>la Cruz under which the latter had to pay the
former P250,000.00 for Lot No. 671-B with an area of 103,108 sq. meters, which
is the very same area Lucia sold to INK on 17 July 1975, is further proof that
Lucia had a weak claim over the property.  If it were otherwise, she would not have parted with P250,000.00 to rea<span style="">c</span>quire it.  That was not at all a picayune sum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the second paragraph of Article 1544 of the Civil
Code does not help the cause of Lucia de la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting that the claim of Lucia de la Cruz should prevail
over that of Clemente by reason of the prior registration in good faith of the
deed of sale in her favor, the fact remains that at the time she sold the
103,108 sq. meters and then later the remaining 84,356 sq. meters to the INK,
the portion acquired earlier by Clemente had already been sold to different
vendees to whom separate TCTs were regularly issued.  These facts were readily available to the INK from the Office of
the Register of Deeds of Quezon City which kept the original copies of the TCTs
issued to <span style="">the </span>vendees of
Clemente.  It is interesting to note
that the sale in favor of the INK over the remaining 84,346 sq. meters was
annotated only in TCT No. 168322 for Lot No. 671-C.  Such a sale could logically cover the lot purchased by Clemente
because the earlier sale to INK <span style="">of </span>103,108
sq. meters was taken from Lot No. 671-C which has an area of 150,000 <span style="">sq. meters.  It </span>is then equally clear that the registration of the deeds of
sale in favor of the INK were also posterior to that of the vendees of
Clemente.  As to who acted in good faith
-- whether the INK or the said vendees -- is a question which should be threshed
out in an appropriate action or proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the petitioners claim that they are in possession
of the property.  The INK does not
vehemently deny this claim.  In any
case, the issue of possession is thus raised, a crucial one in double sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has also been shown that the petitioners were not parties <span style="">in </span><i style=""><span style="">De la Cruz vs. de la Cruz</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">(130 SCRA 666 [1984).  I </span>fully agree with Madame Justice

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">QUIASON, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur with the Resolution insofar as it dismisses the petition
in G.R. No. 76265 and denies the petition in G.R. No. 83280.  My reason is that the basic issue -- which
of the conflicting duplicate transfer certificates of title shall prevail --
could not be raised, entertained and resolved in the proceedings (LRC 1978 and
Civil Case No. 45767 of RTC, Branch 101, Quezon City) subject of the petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conflicting transfer certificates of title are TCT No. 16212
issued to Armando Clemente on August 9, 1951 and TCT No. RT-59 (purported to be
a replacement of TCT No. 40355) issued to Lucia de la Cruz in 1971 after a <span style="">reconstitution proceeding.  Both duplicate transfer certificates of
title trace their progeny from TCT No. 40355, which was issued in the names of
Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz in 1940.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 76265 is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court to reverse and set
aside the decision of the Administrator of the National Land Titles and Deeds
Registration Administration (NLTDRA) in Consulta Case LRC 1978.  As held by the NLTDRA Administrator himself,
he could not accede to petitioner's request for an investigation of the
supposed anomaly in connection with the reconstitution of TCT No. RT-­59
because the issue raised by petitioner was litigious in nature and cannot be
decided in the <u>consulta</u> case.  The Court agreed with the NLTDRA Administrator when he stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Undeniably, the arguments and issues raised by petitioner
require adjudication of facts which, under the circumstances of this case, we
are not prepared to do so as this Court is not a trier of facts.  Moreover, the present petition is not the
proper remedy in challenging the validity of certificates of titles since the
judicial action is a direct and not a collateral attack" (208 SCRA 229,
244).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">G.R. No. 83280 is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court to reverse and set aside the
decision of the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 08146), affirming the
dismissal of petitioners' complaint to enjoin private respondent Iglesia Ni
Kristo from fencing the lots bought by petitioners from Armando Clemente.  The Court quoted with approval the holding
in <u>Natalia</u> <u>Realty</u> <u>Corporation</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Vallez</u>, 173
SCRA 534 (1989), that a certificate of title cannot be questioned collaterally
since Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree provides that such title
can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a direct proceeding in accordance
with law (208 SCRA 229, 244).</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent insofar as the Resolution holds that the issue of the
ownership of the title to the lots in question had been conclusively adjudged
in favor of Lucia de la Cruz in <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> <u>v.</u> <u>De</u>
<u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>, 130 SCRA 666 (1984) and could no longer be relitigated
under the principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Res</u> <u>judicata</u> does not apply because there are no
identity of parties and no identity of causes of action, both being
indispensable requisites before said principle becomes operative (Abes v.
Rodil, 17 SCRA 822 [1966]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In 61969, the petitioners, who were the plaintiffs in Civil Case
No. 20942 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, were Augustina de la Cruz
and the other heirs of Policarpio de la Cruz and Luciana Rafael; while the
respondents, who were the defendants in said civil case, were Lucia de la Cruz
and the Iglesia Ni Kristo.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 76265, the party who sought to nullify the titles of
respondents Lucia de la Cruz and the Iglesia Ni Kristo was petitioner Virginia
Calalang.  The latter is not a privy of
Augustina de la Cruz nor is she an heir of Policarpio de la Cruz and Luciana
Rafael.  Neither are petitioners Augusto
M. de Leon, et al., in G.R. No. 83280 privies of Augustina de la Cruz nor heirs
of Policarpio de la Cruz and Luciana Rafael.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 20942 of the Court of First
Instance of Rizal and petitioners in L-61969 brought the action <span style="">as </span>heirs of Policarpio de la Cruz and
Luciana Rafael to demand their rightful share in the inheritance allegedly
usurped by Lucia de la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in G.R. Nos. 76265 and 83280 claim to have
derived their titles from Armando Clemente, who in turn derived his title from
Eugenia de la Cruz and Dorotea de la Cruz.  The principle action was to enjoin the Iglesia Ni Kristo from fencing
the lots occupied by the plaintiffs, the declaration of who of the parties had
a superior title being incidental.</p>

<p class="BODY">I wonder no end how the Court arrived at its conclusion that
"the petitioners can not raise anew the question of ownership of Lucia de
la Cruz over lot 671 which had been determined by the Court of Appeals and
affirmed by the Supreme Court in the de la Cruz Case," after it
acknowledged that a judicial determination of a right or fact (citing Church
Assistance Program, Inc. v. Sibulo, 171 SCRA 408 [1989]) is conclusive only
"upon the parties and those in privity with them in law or estate"
(208 SCRA 224, 225).</p>

<p class="BODY">I can not accept the assertion of the Court that the <u>De</u> <u>la</u>
<u><span style="">Cruz</span></u><span style=""> </span>decision should be applied to the
present cases "since the facts on which such decision was predicated
continue to be the facts of the case before us now," after it admitted
that it could not pass upon the controversial facts raised by petitioners <span style="">(<u>supra</u>, </span>pp. 225 and 229).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">It is markworthy that there was
no mention in the <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> decision of the cancellation
of TCT No. 40355 and the issuance of a new transfer certificate of title in
favor of Armando Clemente on August 9, 1951.  Such vital facts were never brought to the attention of the Court in the
<u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> <span style="">case;
otherwise, the Court could have made a determination of which certificate of
title shall prevail – the title issued in 1951 to Armando Clemente or the one
issued in 1971 to Lucia de la Cruz.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there are so many other factual questions that have just
been glossed over due to the facile application of the principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
in the Decision sought to be reconsidered and in the Resolution denying the
motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall mention only the most intriguing ones:</p>

<p class="NUM">(1) If the parcel of land in question was in the possession of
Policarpio de la Cruz and Luciana Rafael, why was it registered under the
Torrens system on April 25, 1940 in the names of Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea
de la Cruz?</p>

<p class="NUM">(2) Who were Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz?</p>

<p class="NUM">(3) Why did Augustina de la Cruz claim title from Policarpio de la
Cruz and Luciana Rafael and not from Eugenia de la Paz and Dorotea de la Cruz?</p>

<p class="NUM">(4) If Lucia de la Cruz bought the parcel of land covered by TCT
No. 40355 from Eugenia de la Cruz and Dorotea de la Cruz in 1941, did the
vendors deliver to her the corresponding transfer certificate of title?</p>

<p class="NUM">(5) If the transfer certificate of title was delivered to Lucia de
la Cruz, did she surrender the title to the Register of Deeds when she
registered the deed of sale in her favor on July 15, 1943?</p>

<p class="NUM">(6) If she surrendered the transfer certificate of title, did the
Register of Deeds cancel the original transfer certificate of title and issue a
new transfer certificate of title to her?</p>

<p class="NUM">(7) Why was the proceeding instituted by Lucia de la Cruz in 1971
for the reconstitution of TCT No. 40355, if the parcel of land covered by such
title had already been transferred to her in 1941?</p>

<p class="NUM">(8) Why was the transfer certificate of title issued to Armando
Clemente in 1951 derived from TCT No. 40355 if the said title had been
cancelled in 1943?</p>

<p class="NUM">(9) Were the lot buyers from Armando Clemente notified of the
reconstitution proceedings instituted by Lucia de la Cruz in 1971?</p>

<p class="BODY">All of these factual issues, and many more, have to be threshed
out in the appropriate case before we can decide which of the conflicting
transfer certificate of title shall prevail.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ROMERO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners, we are
again called upon to take a second look at our decision in <u>Calalang</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Register</u> <u>of</u> <u>Deeds</u> <u>of</u> <u>Quezon</u> <u>City</u>
dated April 22, 1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a> which
dismissed petitioners' action for lack of merit.  In said decision, we re-applied the facts as settled in the
earlier <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> <u>v</u>. <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>
case dated July 25, 1984<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> since the
facts of the latter case continue to be the facts before us now.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 13, 1992, petitioners filed the instant motion for
reconsideration with the prayer that they be heard <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.  After requiring respondents to comment, we
granted petitioner's prayer for oral argument before the Third Division and set
the hearing on October 12, 1992.  After
hearing the arguments of all the parties, the Third Division resolved to
require petitioners and respondent to file their respective memoranda.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> Subsequently, on February 10, 1993, the instant
case was referred by the Third Division to the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>;<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> having been accepted by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
the case became an <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before we proceed to a re-examination of our decision, I wish to
reiterate that the instant case was accepted by the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
because it is high time that the Court, sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
definitively resolve the uncertain status of more than 100 Transfer
Certificates of Title and their derivatives<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> which
were all traceable to TCT no. 16212 issued in favor of Amando Clemente.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my position that the doctrine of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
should not have been applied to the instant <u>Calalang</u> case vis-a-vis the
earlier <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> case as to bring about the dismissal of
petitioner's action for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of petitioners that the <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>
case is not applicable inasmuch as, being an action <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>,
it is binding only upon <span style="">the parties </span>involved
therein, namely, Agustina de la Cruz et al., Lucia de la Cruz and Iglesia Ni
Kristo (INK).</p>

<p class="BODY">To recall, the <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> case was an action
to recover possession and ownership filed by Agustina against Lucia de la Cruz
as predecessor-in-interest of INK.  With
respect to the object against which the said action was directed, such action
is classified as an action <u>in</u> <u>personam</u> because its objective was
to establish a claim or liability against Lucia de la Cruz for conveying to
INK, a parcel of land which Agustina and her co-plaintiffs claimed was a part
of their inheritance in the estate of their grandfather, Policarpio de la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although an action to recover a parcel of land is a real action
since it concerns a right over real property, such action is an action <u>in</u>
<u>personam</u> in the sense that its judgment binds only particular parties,
the latter having been the only ones heard before the Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> To repeat, a real action may at the same time be an
action <u>in</u> <u>personam</u> and not necessarily an action <u>in</u> <u>rem</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> <span style="">An action </span>to
<span style="">recover possession </span>of real
property is not an action <u>in</u> <u>rem</u> or an action against the whole
world, like a land registration proceeding or probate of a will; it is an
action <u>in</u> <u>personam</u>, such that a judgment therein is binding only
upon the parties properly impleaded and duly heard or given an opportunity to
be heard.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> Accordingly, since the petitioners herein were not
impleaded in the <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> case, the same has no binding
effect upon petitioners <span style="">in </span>this
present controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our decision in <u>Calalang</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Register</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Deeds</u> which heavily relied on the doctrine of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
in upholding INK's claim over Lot 671-C cannot be applied because for <u>res</u>
<u>judicata</u> to apply, there must be, among other requisites, identity of
parties and cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This we fail to see in the instant case vis-a-vis the <u>De</u> <u>la</u>
<u>Cruz</u> case.  We cannot consider
petitioners herein as "successors-in-interest by title subsequent to the
commencement of action"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> because
petitioners' transfer certificates of title were obtained prior to the
institution of the action to recover ownership and possession by Agustina de la
Cruz in 1975.  Note that petitioners
obtained their respective titles after the 1952 sale by Dorotea de la Cruz to
Amando Clemente, predecessor-­in-interest of petitioners, who developed the lot
into a subdivision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lack of identity of parties is underscored by the fact that
not one of the petitioners in the instant case was joined as a party in the <u>De</u>
<u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> case, although they were already real parties in interest
at the time, having constructed buildings on the disputed property after 1952
and before 1975.  An action for recovery
of possession and ownership should be maintained against the actual or legal
possessors of the property, for such persons are real parties in interest bound
by the judgment which may be rendered in that action.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> In fact, had the 1984 suit of Agustina de la Cruz
against properties of Lucia de la Cruz prospered, petitioners herein as actual
possessors since 1952 would undeniably sustain damages.  Clearly, petitioners, as real parties in
interest, have a real, actual, material and substantial interest,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a> for they would have lost their lots and <span style="">houses </span>if the claim of Agustina had
been sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, <u>res</u> <u><span style="">judicata</span></u><span style=""> </span>is not applicable to the case at bar
because there is no identity of causes of action between the <u>De</u> <u>la</u>
<u><span style="">Cruz</span></u><span style=""> </span>case and the instant petition.  In the <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u><span style="">Cruz</span></u><span style=""> </span>case, the cause of action was for the recovery of possession
against Lucia which was anchored on the issue of whether or not a trust and/or
co-ownership existed between Lucia de la Cruz and the heirs of Maximo and
Filomeno de la Cruz.  Thus, the Court
principally examined the evidence presented by Agustina de la Cruz and her
co-petitioners to prove their claim that they had been defrauded by Lucia de la
Cruz of their inheritance from their grandfather, Policarpio de la Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in the present case, the cause of action is
for the quieting of title, which arose from a <u><span style="">consulta</span></u><span style=""> </span>case
wherein the Register of Deeds entertained doubts regarding the registrability
of the Transfer Certificate of Title in the name of Constancio Simangan, the
land involved being covered by two sets of titles issued in the names of
different owners, one <span style="">derived from
Amando Clemente and the other from Lucia de la Cruz (RT-58).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, conspicuous is the absence of any <u><span style="">lis</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">pendens</span></u><span style=""> </span>annotated in petitioners'
Certificates of Title.  Any decision in
a case involving any right to land registered under the Land Registration Law
shall only bind parties thereto unless notice of <u><span style="">lis</span></u><span style=""> <u>pendens</u></span>
is recorded in the Certificate of Title.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A major point to be considered in this reversal is the anomalous
primary entry of the deed of sale relating to Lot 671 on July 17, 1943 which
had been caused to be made by Lucia de la Cruz in the Day Book of the Register
of Deeds of Manila (Entry No. 258, Page 7, Vol. 7).<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a> Such entry cannot be considered as the operative
act that conveyed the property to her as vendee because the Deed of Sale was
not registered in accordance with law.  Section 50 of Act 496,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a> then the
law in force, provides that, "registration of all voluntary transactions
affecting registered lands shall be made in the office of the Register of Deeds
for the province or city where the land lies." It is but logical for
transactions affecting registered lands to be inscribed in the Register of
Deeds of the province or city where the same are located for accessibility and
convenience to the parties involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, this requirement has been glaringly
violated.  Contrary to the above-cited
provision, the inscription of the Deed of Sale was made in the Register of
Deeds of the City of Manila instead of in the Province of Rizal.  Thereby, Lucia de la Cruz disregarded the
existence of TCT No. 40355 Book T-201 which had been in the custody of the
Register of Deeds of Pasig, Rizal since April 25, 1940 until April 11, 1946
when it was transferred to the Register of Deeds of Quezon City.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">17</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>cannot accept
respondent's allegations that during the Japanese Occupation, registration of
transactions, regardless of where the titles were kept, was undertaken by the
Register of Deeds of Manila, for that would be tantamount to disregarding the
existence of Act 496, a non-political law which continues in force until
changed or abrogated by the rightful sovereign, i.e., the Commonwealth of the
Philippines and later the Republic of the Philippines.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">18</span></span></a> Administrators who are mandated by law to
discharge certain ministerial duties may not, with impunity, violate the same
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the primary entry in the day book of the Register of
Deeds in favor of Lucia De la Cruz cannot prevail over TCT 40355 because entry
in the day book is only a preliminary step in registration while the issuance
of a new certificate of title is the final step which produces the effect of
registration.  In practice, the first
and the last steps are not completed within the same day.  It is however, of no consequence when actual
registration is finally accomplished, for when accomplished, its effect
retroacts as of the date of the entry in the day book.  But if the issuance of a new certificate of
title could not be accomplished at all, the primary entry in the day book
automatically loses its force and effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">19</span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No evidence is adduced to show that a Transfer Certificate of
Title was ever issued to Lucia de la Cruz.  The <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u><span style="">Cruz</span></u>
decision merely speculated that one must have been issued to her, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In due course of official business and duty, <u>a</u> <u>new</u>
<u><span style="">Transfer</span></u><span style=""> <u>Certificate</u> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">Title</span></u><span style=""> <u>must</u> </span><u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u><span style="">issued</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>new</u> <u>owner,</u> <u><span style="">Lucia</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>.  <u>The</u> <u><span style="">entire</span></u><span style=""> <u>records</u>
</span><u>do</u> <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> <u>disclose</u> </span><u>the</u> <u>number</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>new</u> <u><span style="">Transfer</span></u><span style=""> <u>Certificate</u> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">Title</span></u><span style=""> (<u>TCT</u>) <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>name</u> </span><u>of</u> <u>Lucia</u>
<u>de</u> <u>la</u> <u><span style="">Cruz</span></u><span style="">.  </span>When
in 1971, Lucia de la Cruz petitioned for the reconstitution of her title in the
Court of First Instance of Manila, <u>she</u> <u><span style="">alleged</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>her</u>
<u>title</u> <u>as</u> <u>No</u>. (<u>N.A</u>.).  The Court granted the petition and the Register of Deeds of
Manila issued to her TCT No. RT-58, thereby cancelling TCT-40355, T201."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">20</span></span></a> (Underscoring provided)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus since there was no certificate of title that was issued
after the alleged sale in favor of Lucia de la Cruz, then the alleged
inscription in the Primary Entry Book in the Registry of Deeds of Manila did
not "ripen" into actual registration.  As such, it cannot prevail over TCT 40355 then in the custody of
the Register of Deeds of the Province of Rizal.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1544 of the Civil Code relating to the provisions on
double sale<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">21</span></span></a> cannot be made to apply in
favor of private<span style=""> </span>respondent INK
just because a new transfer certificate of title must have been issued after
the sale on November 29, 1941 by Eugenia de la Cruz and Dorotea de la Cruz to
Lucia de la Cruz (INK's predecessor-in-interest).  This is because the preference supposed to be conferred by
Article 1544 upon the inscription of the Deed of Sale in Lucia's favor in the
Register of Deeds of Manila failed to materialize for reasons already
discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, Amando Clemente's procurement in good faith of TCT No.
16212 issued over Lot 671-A on August 9, 1951 must be considered as the first
inscription after TCT No. 40335.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that "when two certificates of title are
issued to different persons covering the same land in whole or in part, the
earlier in date must prevail, and, in case of successive registrations where
more than one certificate is issued over the land, the person holding a prior
certificate is entitled to the land as against a person who relies on a
subsequent certificate."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">22</span></span></a> A closer
examination of TCT No. 40355 discloses that it was signed by Register of Deeds
Teodoro Gonzales on April 25, 1940.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a> The last
inscription in the series of transactions at the back <span style="">shows </span>the sale of Lot 671-A to Amando Clemente on August 1, 1951
for the sum of P178,556.40.  In lieu
thereof, TCT No. 16212 in Clemente's name and TCT No. 16213 were issued,
Clemente obtaining his TCT No. 16212 on August 9, 1951.  On the other hand, INK obtained its TCT No.
168322 on July 17, 1975.  Consequently,
as between the title of Amando Clemente and Iglesia Ni Kristo, who are both
claimants to part of the same land, Clemente's earlier certificate of title
must prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to Clemente's inscription, there was no indication whatsoever
of any sale by Eugenia and Dorotea de la Cruz to Lucia de la Cruz in 1941 which
respondents claim to have effectively preempted <span style="">any </span>subsequent dealings on Lot 671, namely the sale in favor of
Amando Clemente in 1951.  INK's
predecessor?in-interest, Lucia de la Cruz, was never able to present a
TCT of the land she claimed to have bought in 1941 from Dorotea de la Cruz and
Eugenia de la Paz.  Lucia merely caused
the cancellation of the original TCT 40355 of her two vendors through the
highly questionable entry in the Primary Entry Book (in 1943) of the Register
of Deeds of Manila and not in the Register of Deeds of Rizal where the subject
land is located, in violation of law.  To remedy this anomaly, she got Reconstituted Title RT-58 some thirty
(30) years later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, to disregard the inscription in favor of Amando
Clemente would destroy the value and reliability of the Torrens System which
prescribes conclusiveness of all matters contained in a certificate of title
issued by the Register of Deeds.  Amando
Clemente, as an innocent purchaser in good faith, rightly relied on the
correctness of the inscriptions at the back of TCT No. 40355.  Under the Torrens System, every person
dealing with registered land may safely rely on the correctness of the
certificate of title issued therefor and the law will in no way oblige him to
go behind the certificate to determine the condition of the property.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a> When there is nothing on the face of the title to
indicate any cloud or vice in the ownership of the property or any encumbrances
thereon, a purchaser is not required to explore further than what the Torrens
Title upon its face indicates, in quest for any hidden defect or inchoate right
that may subsequently defeat his right thereon.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the inscription of the Deed of Sale in the Registry of
Manila was invalid, it follows that the reconstitution of the same document by
Lucia de la Cruz in 1971, 30 years after the sale by Dorotea de la Cruz is
perforce invalid, applying the legal maxim that a spring cannot rise higher
than its source.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it could not be given effect because it was attended
with legal infirmities.  Although the <u>De</u>
<u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u> case mentions that the "reconstitution
proceedings" in 1971 were "duly published,"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a> the case does not state that notices were given to
adjoining owners as required by Republic Act No. 26.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">27</span></span></a> Petitioners insist that they had never received
any notice of the reconstitution proceedings.  They further allege that it was only in 1986 when INK started putting up
"No Trespassing" signs on their property, that they became aware of
other claimants to their properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reconstitution proceeding is an <u>in</u> <u>rem</u>
proceeding.  But before it can be treated
as such, certain pre-requisites must first be complied with.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">28</span></span></a> Sec. 12 of R.A. No. 26 expressly requires service
of notice of the initial hearing to the adjoining owners and the actual
occupants of the land.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">29</span></span></a> Said
section provides that a petition for reconstitution shall state or contain,
among other things, "(e) the names and addresses of the occupants or
persons in possession of the property, of the owners of adjoining properties
and of all persons who may have interest in the property." The next
section mandates the publication of said notice of the petition at the expense
of the petitioner and the sending of copies of the notice to parties mentioned
in Sec. 12.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">30</span></span></a> Notice by publication is
insufficient as regards actual possessors of the property.  It cannot be overemphasized that notice is
jurisdictional and lack of it deprives the court of authority to make a valid
decree.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">31</span></span></a> In petitions for reconstitution of titles, actual
owners and <u>possessors</u> of the lands must be duly served with actual and
personal notice of the petition.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">32</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Needless to say, since publication, in and of itself is
insufficient, the reconstitution of TCT RT No. 58 in favor of Lucia de la Cruz
was necessarily invalid.  Hence, when
Lucia de la Cruz sold the disputed property on July 17, 1975, she was in no
position to transmit any dominical rights to her vendee Iglesia ni Kristo.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">ACCORDINGLY, </span>I vote
to <span style="">GRANT </span>the petitioners' motion
for reconsideration, without prejudice to litigating anew in another
appropriate proceeding the issues of overlapping of titles among various
claimants and of good faith on the part of the Iglesia ni Kristo.</p>

<p class="BODY">I share the views expressed by Mr. Justice Camilo Quiason in his
concurring and dissenting opinion.  I
just should like to add, by way of clarification, that while, as Justice
Quiason states, "a certificate of title cannot be questioned collaterally
since Section 48 of the Property Registration Decree provides that such title
can be altered, modified or cancelled only in a direct proceeding in accordance
with law" (citing Natalia Realty Corporation vs. Vallez, 173 SCRA 534;
Calalang vs. Register of Deeds of Quezon City, 208 SCRA 229, 244), when,
however, the certificate of title is <u>void</u> <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u> (such
as one that proceeds from a void judgment or from a free patent issued on land
already privately owned), the title may also be attacked collaterally (Agne vs.
Director of Lands, 181 SCRA 793:  Estoesta, Sr. vs. Court of Appeals, 179 SCRA 203).</p>
