transferred to the plaintiff corporation and the mortgage in favor of PSB are

reference to the PISO Mortgage because:  (i) Barfel and Reginas believed that since Barfel’s balance to PISO was
only about P54,000, release of the PISO Mortgage could be obtained within 30
days; and (ii) Reginas wanted to be able to present to PSB <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>“clean document” to expedite the
approval of its loan.</blockquote>

</span><!--[endif]-->Regarding the release of the PISO Mort­gage, plaintiffs
undertook to make direct and active representations with the proper officers of
the Central Bank (because PISO is in the custody of a Central Bank officer as
receiver/liquidator) and agreed that the responsibility of the defend­ants was
solely to provide the documentation to support the position that Barfel’s
remaining balance under the PISO Mortgage was only about P54,000.</blockquote>

representations with the proper officers of the Central Bank.</blockquote>

PSB, as a condition for the disbursement of the loan, wanted the title to the

(herein petitioners’) presentation of evidence, private respondents filed on 13
March 1990, a motion for leave to file an amended complaint and motion to admit
the same.  The amendment consisted of
impleading PISO bank as additional party defendant and compel it to accept
payment of the existing second mortgage from private respondent Reginas, since
allegedly no complete relief can be had unless the second mortgage in favor of
said PISO bank is released.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Despite petitioners’
opposition, an order was issued by the trial court on 30 April 1990 admitting

their motion for reconsideration on 1 June 1990, petitioners proceeded to the
Court of Appeals on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition (CA-G.R.

(Section 3, Rule 10 of the Revised Rules of Court), does not stop the court
from allowing substantial amendments, after the trial has begun, there being
nothing in the rule as changed, which limits the court’s authority to allow
substantial amendments to the pleading just because trial has already begun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The amendment of the complaint was made without intent to delay the
action.  The essence of the liberal
interpretation accorded by the courts on the filing of an amended complaint is
the <u>avoidance of multiplicity of suits</u>.  And also, private respondents’ cause of action has not been
substantially altered.</blockquote>

comply with its obligation under the Agreement to Buy/Sell dated 19 June 1987

the original complaint sought to be amended was well known to </span>private respondents
from the start.  The reason for the
amendment impleading PISO is to compel the latter to accept herein respondents’
payment and release the second mortgage thereby enabling petitioners to deliver
to respondents the titles free from all liens and encumbrances.  <u>But</u> <u>PISO</u> <u>bank</u> <u>is</u>
<u>not</u> <u>a</u> <u>party</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>three (3)</u> <u>contracts</u>

<u>for</u> <u>specific</u> <u>performance</u> <u>and</u> <u>damages</u> <u>between</u>
<u>the</u> <u>private</u> <u>respondents</u> <u>and</u> <u>petitioners</u>.  The bank which is not a party to the
transaction is not an indis­pensable party.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither is there an acceptable explana­tion from private respondents why PISO
Bank was not implead­ed in the original complaint filed before the RTC of
Makati.  PISO is a second mortgagee,
whatever the outcome of the litigation between the petitioners and the private
respondents would be.  Its second
mortgage lien attaches to the property.  The action for specific performance by private respondents against
petitioners is not the proper venue for releasing all liens and encumbrances on
the subject property.  Perhaps, herein
private respondents have confused the possible liability of petitioner Barrios
for allegedly withholding information on the said second mortgage as another
cause of action <u>against</u> <u>him</u> arising from the executed
contracts.  But title to the disputed
properties can still be delivered by petitioners to herein respondents, by way
of specific performance with damages, encumbered of course by the second
mortgage in favor of PISO but the release of such encumbrance can be obtained
independently of this case.  To include
it as another cause of action in the case at bar against an additional
defendant, would indeed change the theory of the case, let alone delay the
proceedings on the original cause of action founded on specific performance
with damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">To compel PISO to accept payment cannot be allowed in an action
for specific performance with damages <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">between</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>other</u> <u>parties</u>.  </span>These are two (2) different
causes.  A second mortgagee like PISO
has several options.  It may either:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->foreclose the second mortgage for non–payment.</blockquote>

</span></span><!--[endif]-->pay off the first mortgagee (BPI in this instance) and
be subrogated to its rights thereby becoming the sole lien holder.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

loan without foreclosing on the mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Under the facts alleged in the amended
complaint, there is no statement that the mortgage debt in favor of PISO is due
and demandable; neither is PISO foreclosing on the mortgage.  And in an unexpected act of liberality, PISO
can even write off the debt (of course an improbability).  In any event private respondents (as
plaintiffs below) cannot compel PISO to accept payment as it is not even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>party to the mortgage contract (with
PISO); the latter cannot be impleaded as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a
</span>party defendant, and the former only has an inchoate right to the
property.  Besides, if the principal
mortgagee, BPI, is not even impleaded why should the second mortgagee PISO be
so impleaded, when it is a stranger to the transaction between petitioners and
private respondents?  Even the mortgage
document purportedly sued upon is not attached to the amended complaint.</p>

the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>“According to Article 1311 of the Civil Code, a contract takes
effect between the parties who made it, and also their assigns and heirs,
except in cases where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are
not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of
law.  Since a contract may be violated
only by the par­ties, thereto as against each other, in an action upon that
contract, the real parties in interest, either as plaintiff or as defendant,
must be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">parties to said contract.  Therefore, a party who has not taken part in
it cannot sue or be sued for performance or for cancellation thereof, unless he
shows that he has a real interest affected thereby.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A “real interest” has been defined as “a present substan­tial
interest, as distinguished from a mere expectancy or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>future, contingent, subordinate or consequential interest.” (Moreno,
Federico B. Philippine Law Dictionary, Third Edition)</p>

<p class="BODY">Complete relief by private respondents against petition­ers may
be had even if PISO/Central Bank were not impleaded as party defendant in the
original case.  PISO is not an
indispensable or necessary party without whom no final deter­mination can be
had of the action for specific performance with damages.  (Sec. 7, Rule 3, Rules of Court).  Private respondents maintain that PISO is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>proper party under sec. 8, Rule 3 of
the Revised Rules of Court.  The
provision invoked reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Section 8.  Joinder of
proper parties.  - When persons who are
not indispensable but who ought to be parties if complete relief is to be
accorded as between those already parties, have not been made parties and are
subject to the jurisdiction of the court as to both service of process and
venue, the court shall order them summoned to appear in the action.  But the court may, in its discretion,
proceed in the action without making such persons parties, and the judgment
rendered therein shall be without prejudice to the rights of such persons.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">From the above, it is
clear that joinder of admittedly proper parties is permissive, that judgment
will be decreed even if all the parties are not present if the court will be
able to proceed to a decree and do justice to the parties already before it,

specific performance and damages is concerned, complete relief maybe accorded
between private respondents and petitioners (as original parties) without the
presence of the second mortgagee (PISO bank).  If complete relief to herein private respondents is the ultimate aim of
the RTC ruling, why did it not include BPI as (proper) party </span>defendant,
since after all, there is an allegation in the original complaint that BPI
refused to go along with the transaction because of petitioners’
representations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the amendment sought by private respondents, which is
to include a new party defendant at a late stage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">in </span>the proceeding is not a formal but a substantial one.  Private respondents will have to present
additional evidence on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">PISO second
mortgage.  The effect would be to start
t</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">anew with the parties recasting their
theories of the </span>case.  The
correct amount of the second mortgage owed by petitioners to PISO bank
(apparently a controverted point), would have to be litigated and this could be
time consuming.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general policy, liberality in allowing amendments is
greatest in the early stages of a law suit, decreases as it progresses and
changes at times to a strictness amounting to a prohibition.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
