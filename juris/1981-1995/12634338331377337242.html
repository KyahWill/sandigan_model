				<H3>ADEZ REALTY, INCORPORATED, PETITIONER, VS. HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF BRANCH 79, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, MORONG, RIZAL, THE PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF RIZAL, MORONG, RIZAL, THE REGISTER OF DEEDS, QUEZON CITY, AND AGUEDO EUGENIO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petition filed on December 28, 1990, by Adez Realty
Incorporated before the Court of Appeals, docketed therein as CA-G.R. SP No.
23773, sought to annul the order of the Regional Trial Court of Morong, Rizal,
dated November 20, 1984, allowing the reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 12662.  The petition likewise
sought to set aside in effect the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
CV No. 21392 dated July 31, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 30, 1991, respondent Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissed the petition for lack of merit.  On June 26, 1991,<span style=""> </span>petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration was denied.  The respondent court, in dismissing the
petition, said that: (a) the petition is a reiteration of the issues raised
before it<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
earlier in CA-G.R. CV No. <span style="">21392, </span>promulgated
July 31, 1990, and since no motion for reconsideration or appeal by <i>certiorari</i>
with the Supreme Court was filed, the same became final and executory, and
consequently entered in the judgment book on October 11, <span style="">1990; </span>and, (b) the Regional Trial
Court of Morong, Rizal, had jurisdiction over the subject matter, the issue
then being one of venue and not of jurisdiction, which can be waived if not
timely objected to in a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Sec. 4, Rule 4, of the
Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court, where petitioner raises four (4) issues <span style="">which </span>nevertheless may be simplified into the following: whether
the Regional Trial Court of Morong, Rizal, may acquire jurisdiction over
reconstitution proceedings involving real property situated in Quezon City, and
whether publication of the notice of the petition in two (2) successive issues
of the Official Gazette and <span style="">its </span>posting
in the bulletin board of the Regional Trial Court of Morong, Rizal, is
sufficient compliance with Sec. 13 of R.A. No. 26.</p>

<p class="BODY">Wittingly or unwittingly, petitioner fails to refute the ruling
of respondent appellate court that the issues presented in the instant case had
been previously raised before and decided upon by the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. CV No. 21392, which decision became final and executory, and in fact
already entered in the judgment book by reason of petitioner<span style="">'</span>s failure to seasonably file an appeal
or a motion for reconsideration.  This <span style="">is </span>fatal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been repeatedly held that finality of judgment becomes a
fact upon the lapse of the reglementary period of appeal if no appeal is
perfected.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision therefore of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 21392 had
attained finality, there being no appeal nor motion for reconsideration
interposed.  Likewise, it is settled
jurisprudence that once a decision becomes final, the Court can no longer
amend, modify, much less set aside the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> In
fact, in <i>Dueñas v. Mandi,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> We
held that the "trial court and the appellate court may have committed an
error in the assignment or partition of the eight parcels of land to the
parties in this case, but considering that their judgments are now final, the
error, assuming that one was committed, can no longer be amended or
corrected." In <i><span style="">Icao v. Apalisok,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>We ruled that even the subsequent
discovery of an erroneous imposition of a penalty will not justify correction
of the judgment after it has become <span style="">final.  We </span>have also declared that, subject
to settled exceptions, once a judgment becomes final, all the issues between
the parties are deemed resolved and laid to rest.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> To
allow the Court to amend or reverse a decision which has attained finality <span style="">will </span>result in endless litigations.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Indeed, every litigation, CA-G.R. CV
No. 21392 included, must come to an end.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner already had the opportunity to <span style="">set </span>aside the questioned order of the
trial court when its Motion to Set Aside and/or Annul the Order of
Reconstitution, filed more than a year after the issuance of the questioned
order, was granted by the trial court, however erroneous may be the procedure
pursued and the consequent relief granted.  Petitioner then simply failed to maintain vigilance over its perceived
rights when it did <span style="">not </span>file a
timely appeal from the adverse decision of the appellate court, thus allowing
the said decision to become final.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, as early as 1910, in <i><span style="">Grey Alba v. De la Cruz,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>We already ruled that land
registration proceedings are proceedings <i><span style="">in rem,</span></i><span style=""> not <i>in
personam,</i> </span>and therefore it <span style="">is
</span>not necessary to give personal notice to the owners or claimants<span style=""> </span>of
the land sought to be registered, in order to vest the courts with power or
authority over the res.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, while it may be true that no notice <span style="">was
</span>sent by registered mail to petitioner when the judicial reconstitution
of title was sought, such failure, however, did not amount to a jurisdictional
defect.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In <i><span style="">Register of </span>Deeds of
Malabon </i><i><span style="">v. RTC, </span>Malabon,
Metro Manila, Br. 170,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><i> </i>We
said that “[t]he purpose of the publication of the notice of the petition for
reconstitution in the Official Gazette is to apprise the whole world that such a
petition has been filed and that whoever is minded to oppose it for good cause
may do so within thirty (30) days before the date set by the court for hearing
the petition.  It is the publication of
such notice that brings in the whole world as a party in the case and vests the
court with jurisdiction to hear and decide it.” Thus, notice of hearing by
proper publication in the Official Gazette is sufficient to clothe the court
with jurisdiction, and the mere fact that a person purporting to have a legitimate
claim in the property did not receive personal notice is not sufficient ground
to invalidate the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shorn of its finery, CA-G.R. SP No. 23773 merely re-echoes the
issues raised in CA-G.R. CV No. 21392 which has become <i><span style="">res judicata.  </span></i>Verily, petitioner's action to annul the order of the trial
court allowing reconstitution duplicates its earlier motion to set aside the
said order, which was granted but later reversed by the appellate court - which
reversal became final and executory due to petitioner's failure to file an
appeal within the reglementary period. A party cannot, by varying the form of
action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the
operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice
litigated.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Be that <span style="">as </span>it may,
there appears to be no cogent reason to disturb, as to other matters, the
findings and conclusions of the Court of Appeals in its decision in CA-G.R. CV
No. 21392, promulgated July 31, 1990, the same having become final and
executory.  Accordingly, We affirm the
assailed decision promulgated April 30, 1991, and resolution issued June 26,
1991, by respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Court adverts to the Petition for Review filed <span style="">in </span>behalf of petitioner Adez Realty,
Inc., by ATTY. BENJAMIN M. DACANAY.  On
pages 2-4 of the Petition, counsel purports to quote, as he does, the
questioned decision when he alleges -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>The facts of
the case, as found by the Court of Appeals, are the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘After trial on the merits, the lower court rendered the questioned
order dated November 20, 1984, <i>without notice to the actual occupants of the
property, Adez Realty,</i> granting the applicant's petition for reconstitution
in the name of the deceased Elias Engenio’" (<i>italics</i> <i>supplied)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the phrase "<i>without notice to the actual
occupants of the property, Adez Realty,</i> <span style="">in </span>the above quoted second paragraph <span style="">on </span>page 3 of the Petition for Review, is not found in the
decision penned by Associate Justice Manuel C. Herrera for respondent Court of
Appeals.  <span style="">It </span>now appears as part of a material statement of fact in the
decision <span style="">of </span>the court <i>a quo </i>when
actually it is not. This to Us is a <i>prima facie</i> case of attempting to
mislead<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, a serious offense which constitutes willful disregard of a lawyer's
solemn duty to act at all times in a manner consistent with truth.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the challenged decision and resolution of
respondent Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 23773 are <i>AFFIRMED</i> and the
instant petition is <i><span style="">DISMISSED</span></i><span style="">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">ATTY. BENJAMIN M. DACANAY is ordered to <i>SHOW CAUSE</i> within
five (5) days from notice why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with for
intercalating a material fact in the judgment of the court <i>a quo</i> thereby
altering and modifying its factual findings with the apparent purpose of<span style=""> </span><span style="">misleading </span>this Court in order
to obtain a favorable judgment, and thus failing to live up to the standards
expected of a member of the Bar.</p>
