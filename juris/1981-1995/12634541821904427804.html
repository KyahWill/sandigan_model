				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On September 3, 1954, Judge Jose S. Rodriguez of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> issued an order in Cadastral
Case No. 1, Cadastral Record No. 58, Lot No. 592-A, Psd-3750, <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> Cadastre, denying the petition of the Municipal
Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> which prayed that herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Navarro be ordered to return to the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
a portion of land which, according to the petitioner, was erroneously included
in the Transfer Certificate of Title No. 2183.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Judge Rodriguez, in denying the petition of the Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, stated that said petition is untenable "for it
would defeat the object of the Torrens System which is to guarantee the
stability, security and indefeasibility of the Torrens Title to the
property."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Carcar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
filed a case, docketed as Civil Case No. R-3679, for <span class="SpellE">Reinvindicacion</span>
against herein respondents <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span> and <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Navarro
and two (2) others, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eufemia</span> <span class="SpellE">Tabay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Teodorico</span> <span class="SpellE">Barcoma</span>, before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this new complaint, herein petitioner
asked the court, inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>, to order the defendants
to return to it the ownership and possession of the land known as Lot No.
592-A, Psd-3750 of the <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> Cadastre.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein private respondents filed a motion to dismiss said Civil
Case No. R-3679 (which became Civil Case No. 313-BC upon its transfer to the <span class="SpellE">Barili</span> Branch of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
court granted the motion and dismissed the said civil case in an order dated <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1968</st1:date>, saying that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The Court believes that the ground of <span class="SpellE">res</span>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span> alleged in the said motion to dismiss is
meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue of ownership
raised in the Cad. <span class="GramE">Case No. 1, Cad.</span> Record No. 58, Lot
No. 592-A, Psd­-3750, of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> Cadastre which was
decided by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, in
its order of September 3, 1954 is identical to the present Civil Case, entitled
"Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span>, plaintiff, vs. <span class="SpellE">Abundio</span> <span class="SpellE">Alfafara</span>, et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., defendants, for there are identity of parties,
identity of cause of action and identity of issues or relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order in said Cadastral Case No. 1 is <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> in the present
action for the conveyance of ownership of the parcel of land known as Lot No.

Case, which order refers to very <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 592-A now in <span class="GramE">question.</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed two (2) motions for reconsideration but the same
were denied by herein respondent court in its order dated <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioner filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond and
a record on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court in
an order, dated <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1968</st1:date>,
disapproved the record on appeal on the ground that the same was filed out of
time, saying that:</p>

<blockquote>"Taking into account the period from the date of service of
said order of March 18, 1968, upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aldemita</span>,
one of the counsels of the plaintiff which was made on March 25, 1968 to the
date of his filing of the Motion for Reconsideration on April 25, 1968, is
thirty-one days, one day late of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period within which to file said motion for reconsideration; and taking into
account the Motion for Reconsideration filed by Asst. Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Benecio</span> <span class="SpellE">Arzadon</span>, another counsel
for the plaintiff, on May 21, 1968, the period of 56 days lapsed from the date
of the receipt (March 25, 1968) of the order of the Court of March 18,
1968."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, with the Municipality
of <span class="SpellE">Carcar</span> praying that the order of respondent court
dated March 18, 1968 be declared null and void and that said public respondent
order the reinstatement and trial of the case on the merits "in order to
determine once and for all the validity of the respective claims of both
parties."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the order of respondent court dismissing
the case purely on the strength of a motion to dismiss is null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for the
reason that it was not given its day in court and thus, did not have the
opportunity to prove the material alle­gations of the complaint concerning the
ownership of Lot No. 592-A; that petitioner was precluded from proving by
documentary evidence the fraudulent inclusion of subject property in the
reconstituted Title No. R. O. -809 (0-4223); that petitioner was precluded in
proving that respondents were only entitled to Lot No. 592-B after subdivision
of Lot No. 592 into two (2), known as Lots Nos. 592-A and 592-B, Psd-3750; and,
that the questioned order of respondent court did not only deprive petitioner
of its property without due process of law, but it also enriches the private
respondents to the prejudice of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
respondent court dis­approved petitioner's record on appeal on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1968</st1:date>, the latter should
have filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i> within a reasonable time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to what would constitute a reasonable time
"it is apparent that the delay in ordinary cases should not be more than
the longest period allowed in the lower court for the party to take action,
which is thirty days. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
It is well settled that <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in making an
application for a writ of <i>mandamus</i> affords sufficient cause for its
denial." (Cortes vs. CFI of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, 52 Phil.
214.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> has been defined as the failure
or neglect, for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, to do that
which by exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier; it
is negligence or omission to assert a right within a reasonable time,
warranting a presumption that the party entitled to assert it either has abandoned
it or declined to assert it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sotto vs. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>, 85 SCRA 154).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it was on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1968</st1:date> when respondent court dismissed Civil Case
No. R-3679 and it was on <st1:date year="1968" day="18" month="8">August 18,
 1968</st1:date> when petitioner's record on appeal was disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By failing to act until <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1970</st1:date> when this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
was filed, petitioner was guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> for not
having taken action seasonably.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's long inaction for one and one-half years is certainly
tantamount to <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and inexcusable neglect that it
should be barred from assert­ing its claim at all.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> is hereby
DISMISSED and the writ of preliminary injunction issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1970</st1:date> is dissolved.</p>
