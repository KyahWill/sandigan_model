<span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pasul</span> and
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span> <span style="">were
</span>engaged in a drinking spree at the store of Delia <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span>
situated at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Nabitasan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Leganes</span>, Iloilo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
thereafter arrived and joined the group.</p>

<p class="BODY">After some time, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Pasul</span> and
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span> left <span style="">the </span>group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> requested Delia <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span> that he <span style="">be </span>allowed
to talk with Aida <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span>, Delia's sister-in-law, <span style="">whom <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> was
courting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that evening, <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> left the store.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> went back to the store at about
<st1:time minute="30" hour="8">8:30</st1:time> in the evening where he saw
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pasul</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> <span style="">invited </span>them
to attend the birthday party of his son, which they accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Calzado</span> were
already in the house of <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> when <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They partook of the supper which consisted <span style="">of </span>noodles and chicken and after which they continued drinking
beer.</p>

<p class="BODY">As there were just few bottles of beer left, <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
volunteered to buy some more beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
pulled out his wallet and extracted a P50.00 bill which he gave to <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> then remarked that he has still enough <span style="">money </span>loft for more bottles of beer as
he counted P1,000.00 remaining in <span style="">his
wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>
then requested <span class="SpellE">Calzado</span> to buy a half </span>case of
beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>
later followed <span class="SpellE">Calzado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> then
invited <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> to <span style="">see </span>the prawn fries <span style="">he </span>just
bought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
obliged and went with <span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> to the latter's
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
was shown the prawn <span style="">fries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He was observed to be wearing a
perforated sleeveless <span class="SpellE">sando</span>, a necklace around the
neck, a watch and a golden ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> later arrived at <span class="SpellE">Jarandillaâ€™s</span>
house and requested them to go back to his house <span style="">as </span>the beer they ordered had already arrived but <span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jarandilla</span> then offered to conduct <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
to his boarding house at the <span style="">SEAFDEC
compound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>
offered to do the chore to which <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> agreed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
of that evening, Delia <span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span> heard a male voice
crying and another male voice saying, "I will submerge your head into the
canal." Delia later heard an explosion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Delia then peeped through the window of her store and saw <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> holding a handgun.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From five (5) meters away, she likewise saw <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>
facing <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>, the <span style="">former holding his left arm, apparently shot and wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delia was able to observe the incident with
the aid of the <span class="SpellE">flourescent</span> light coming from
multi-purpose building and from the 50 watt-bulb from <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>'
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Twenty minutes later, another
explosion was heard coming from the direction of the house of <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The next day, Delia heard
talks of the presence of a cadaver inside the house of <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she went out of their house, Delia saw <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> taking his coffee at a neighbor's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delia accosted <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span>
charging the latter of killing <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> merely
answered that <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> was killed because the latter
was a drug addict.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The personal effects of <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> consisting of his wallet, driver's license, SEAFDEC
Identification Card, his denim pants and jacket</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> were turned over by the police to Carlos <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> who issued a receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The autopsy of the
cadaver of the victim was performed by Dr. </span><span style="">Tito </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Doromal</span></span><span style="">, the Medico-Legal Officer, who stated his
findings in </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">Medico-Legal Report and who prepared a sketch
of a human body.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The victim suffered from two (2) gunshot wounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bullet wound No. 1, the fatal wound, is located at the back
portion of the lower right of the neck and head, particularly behind the right
ear.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
A deformed slug was recovered from inside the mouth of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Doromal</span> stated that the victim was in a kneeling
position when shot at close range, as the powder burns were very evident around
the wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bullet Wound No. 2 <span style="">is </span>found under the <span class="SpellE">thoraco</span>-abdominal
region with powder burns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slug from
that wound was recovered at the superior border of left scapula or left knee
bone.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears likewise that <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> did
not have the license to possess the firearm that was found in <span style="">his </span>possession after the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, in due course, two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
were filed against <span class="SpellE">Jolipas</span> in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for the crimes of illegal possession of a homemade single shot <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span> Pistol and for Robbery with Homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment, the accused entered a plea
of not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the trial
followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A decision was rendered by the
trial court on <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1989</st1:date>
convicting the accused as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, this Court finds the
accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt on both charges and hereby sentences
him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Criminal Case No. 31392, for
Illegal Possession of Firearm, an indeterminate penalty of SIX (6) YEARS and
ONE (1) DAY as<span style=""> </span>Minimum to TEN
(10) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY as Maximum; in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case
No. 31393, to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA or Imprisonment For
Life.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused is hereby further ordered to pay the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gargar</span> an indemnity in
the amount of P30,000.00, and to pay the peso value of the wristwatch,
necklace, and ring of the deceased which is P4,500.00, and another P1,000.00
which was the money missing in the wallet of the deceased, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No pronouncement as to cost."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith, the accused now interposed this appeal,
alleging the following assigned errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THAT THE HONORABLE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS FINDINGS THAT ACCUSED
COMMITTED ROBBERY, BEING SO THE ACCUSED CANNOT BE CONVICTED OF ROBBERY WITH
HOMICIDE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THAT IT ERRED IN NOT APPRECIATING SELF-DEFENSE, DEFENSE OF
RELATIVES OR AT LEAST INCOMPLETE SELF-DEFENSE AND VOLUNTARY SURRENDER OF THE
ACCUSED.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THAT IT ERRED IN NOT APPRECIATING THAT ACCUSED IS AN AGENT OF THE
STATE IN ITS RIGHT TO PRESERVE ITSELF FROM SUBVERSION THUS, THE ACCUSED CANNOT
BE HELD LIABLE FOR VIOLATION OF P.D. 1866."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds the appeal to be devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the appellant admits the killing he interposed self-defense
or defense of relative to exculpate himself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He advanced the fantastic story that the victim went to the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> house at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00
 o'clock</st1:time> on that evening, disrobed himself and then made karate
stances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With a knife, the victim
allegedly brought havoc to appellant's house and destroyed appellant's
furniture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he allegedly threatened
to harm appellant's wife, prompting appellant to shoot him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the victim allegedly tried to attack him
the appellant then shot the victim anew.</p>

<p class="BODY">This pretension of the appellant was given scant consideration by
the trial court as it is not corroborated by any credible evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the physical evidence shows that one of the two
bullet wounds reflected in the autopsy report appears to have been inflicted
while the victim was <span style="">in </span>a
kneeling position to the back portion of the head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How the victim sustained a gunshot wound at
the back of the right ear when the protagonists are supposed to be facing each
other, as claimed by appellant, has not been satisfactorily explained by the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Prosecution witness Delia
<span class="SpellE">Alcalde</span> categorically testified that at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span style="">11:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style=""> that evening she heard a male voice crying
and another male voice saying, "I will submerge your head into the
canal." She later heard an explosion and when she peeped through the
window of her store, she saw the accused holding a handgun, facing the victim
who was in turn holding his left arm apparently shot </span>and wounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is obvious from this set of facts is
that the appellant was the unlawful aggressor as he shot the defenseless
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently from said place
appellant brought the victim to his house whereby he fired the second shot
which proved to be fatal this time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
claim of self-defense <span style="">is </span>thus
untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The body of the victim was found in the house of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police then arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the police <span style="">searched the body of the victim, there was no more necklace, watch and </span><span style="">gold </span><span style="">ring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wallet was found
empty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the observation of the trial court that
under the circumstances of the case the only logical conclusion is that it was
the appellant who took the personal effects of the victim after the
killing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commission <span style="">of </span><span style="">the robbery with the homicide has been duly established.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant assails the
credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution alleging certain
inconsistencies and improbabilities in their testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds that the alleged
inconsistencies are on minor matters which rather than affect their credibility
are indications of truth and candor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the findings of the trial </span>court as to the credibility
of witnesses is seldom disturbed by the appellate court because of its superior
advantage of observing the conduct and demeanor of the witnesses while
testifying unless some facts and circumstances may have been overlooked that
may affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant failed to show a cogent basis for the court to depart from this good
rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The desperate plea of the appellant is that he is not guilty of
illegal possession of a firearm because he was then a member of the <span class="SpellE">Bantay</span> <span class="SpellE">Banua</span> or <span class="SpellE">Alsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Masa</span> which is a <span class="SpellE">para</span>-military organization against insurgency whereby they
are allowed to carry firearms without the need to secure a license, as part of
the anti-insurgency drive of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cites the testimony of Station Commander, Major <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rojo</span>, in support of his claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, an examination of the
testimony of said police officer shows that although he issued a memorandum
receipt for firearms issued to recruits <span style="">in
</span><span class="SpellE">Bantay</span> <span class="SpellE">Banua</span>, he
denied having authorized the use of a homemade firearm by the appellant without
a license or memorandum receipt.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This denial was confirmed by Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Superio</span> who assisted in the issuance of memorandum receipts
to said recruits.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 1866 explicitly provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Unlawful
Manufacture, Sale, Acquisition, Disposition or Possession of Firearms or
Ammunition or Instruments Used or Intended to be Used in the Manufacture </u><u><span style="">of Firea</span>rms or Ammunition. - The
penalty of reclusion temporal</u> in its maximum period to <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u> shall be imposed upon any person who shall
unlawfully manufacture, deal in, acquire, dispose, or possess any firearm, part
of firearm, ammunition or machinery, tool or instrument used or intended to be
used in the manufacture of any firearm or ammunition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant was found <span style="">in
</span>possession of an unlicensed firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His liability is obvious.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
