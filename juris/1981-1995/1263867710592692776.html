				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Private respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> was
employed as an <span class="SpellE">admeasurer</span> by the petitioner Gold City
Integrated <span style="">Port </span>Services, Inc.
("<st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was suspected by management of <span class="SpellE">undermeasuring</span> cargo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="1">23 January 1987</st1:date>, the cargo control
officer ordered two (2) other <span class="SpellE">admeasurers</span> to
re-measure three (3) pallets of bananas which had already been measured by
private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The re-measurement revealed that respondent had under-measured the bananas by <span style="">1.427 cubic meters.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent felt insulted by the re-measurement and so the
next day he went to the office of the Chief <span class="SpellE">Admeasurer</span>,
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span>, and there confronted Nigel <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span>, one of the two (2) <span class="SpellE">admeasurers</span>
who had re-checked his work, regarding the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent quarreled with <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span> in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span>,
their immediate superior, inside the latter's office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guangco</span> directed
private respondent to stop provoking <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span> and
told both that being in his office, they should behave properly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent ignored this oral
directive and a fistfight erupted then and there between him and <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both were
eventually pacified by their co-workers.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> was then
charged <span style="">with </span>assaulting a
co-employee and falsifying reports and records <span style="">of </span>the <span style="">company relative </span>to
<span class="GramE">the</span> performance of his duties, and was preventively
suspended pending investigation of his case by the union-management grievance
committee.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In a letter dated <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="3">20 March 1987</st1:date>,
the grievance committee referred the disposition of the matter to management in
view of the objections of the aggrieved parties to the proposal that private
respondent <span style="">be </span>meted out a
penalty of forty-five (45) <span style="">days </span>suspension.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Apparently, <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span>
did not consider suspension an ade<span style="">q</span>uate
sanction considering private respondent's alleged inability to get along with
the other <span class="SpellE">admeasurers</span> <span style="">and with </span>the company's customers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="4">11 April 1987</st1:date>,
private respondent received a notice of termination of services <span style="">upon </span>the grounds of assaulting a <span style="">co-</span>employee and of insubordination.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> filed a
complaint for illegal dismissal with the<span style="">

Employment on <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="5">25 May 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> the
finding of insubordination, contending that there was no evidence he had <span class="SpellE"><span style="">wilfully</span></span><span style=""> </span>disobeyed any order given by his
superior during the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted assaulting his co-em<span style="">p</span>lo<span style="">y</span>ee but claimed that that did not
constitute just cause for his dismissal under Article 282 (d) <span style="">of </span>the Labor Code because that act was
<span style="">not </span>an offense committed against
his employer's duly authorized representative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He prayed for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and
damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> in its answer argued that <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span> failure to heed <span class="SpellE">Guangco's</span>
order to stop provoking <span class="SpellE">Mabalacad</span> constituted
insubordination or disrespect towards a superior officer punishable by
dismissal under the Schedule of disciplinar<span style="">y</span> sanctions and norms of conduct, incorporated in <span style="">the existing Collective Bargaining Agreement
("CBA") with the union.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter rendered an award in favor of private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> holding that the dismissal was
illegal because there was no evidence to support the charge of insubordination,
and that assault on a co-employee was punishable only <span style="">with </span>fifteen (15) days suspension under the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span>
Schedule of penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the
strained relations between the parties, however, the Labor Arbiter did not
order reinstatement and awarded <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> separation
pay and attorney's fees instead.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed to the National Labor <span style="">Relations </span>Commission
("NLRC").</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC, in a decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="8">30 August 1988</st1:date>, held that only <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span>
appeal <span style="">was </span>meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It declined to characterize the assailed
conduct of <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> as insubordination under Article
282 (a) of the Labor Code because <span class="SpellE">Guangco's</span> order was
"not connected with" <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span> work, and
did not amount to <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> or gross disrespect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC modified the Labor Arbiter’s
decision by ordering private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span>
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, having moved for reconsideration without success, is
before this Court on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="2">20 February 1989</st1:date>,
the Court issued<span style=""> </span>a temporary

<p class="BODY">In its Petition, <st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
emphasizes management's prerogative to promulgate rules of discipline and to
enforce the Schedule of disciplinary sanctions providing for dismissal of an
employee who commits gross disrespect of a superior officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment on the Petition, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> alleged that he was apprised of the charge of
insubordination only in his notice of termination, and that he was thereby
denied an opportunity to be heard on this charge before being dismissed, in
violation of Sections 2 and 5 of Rule 14 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the
Labor Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two (2) issues are posed for resolution in this case:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether private respondent was denied due
process in the course of his dismissal; and (b) whether private respondent was
dismissed for a just cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the first issue, it must <span style="">be </span>noted that petitioner did not properly inform private
respondent of all the infractions of company regulations which subsequently
became the justification for his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After being preventively suspended, he was charged with assaulting a
co-employee and falsifying reports and records of the <span style="">company </span>relating to the performance of his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, throughout the investigation
conducted at the company level, private respondent's explanations in defense
were shaped to meet only those charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner discovered it could not sustain the charge of falsification <span style="">of company </span>records against private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since assault upon a
co-employee, the charge admitted by private respondent, is punishable only with
fifteen (15) days suspension under the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span> Schedule
of penalties, it in effect became necessary for petitioner <span style="">to </span>characterize said assault as an act
<span style="">of </span>"insubordination or
disrespect towards a superior officer”, an offense punishable with dismissal
under the Schedule.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">So</span> it came to pass that when
private respondent received his notice of termination, the causes <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> were stated as assault on a <span style="">co-</span>employee and insubordination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court considers that there was here at least a partial <span style="">deprivation of private </span>respondent’s
right to procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
could not be expected adequately to defend himself <span style="">as </span>he was not fully or correctly informed of the charges against
him which management intended to prove.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is less than fair for management to charge an employee with one
offense and then to dismiss him for having committed another offense with which
he had not been charged and against which he<span style=""> </span>was therefore unable adequately to defend himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Correct specification of private respondent's
alleged wrongdoing was obviously important here, since the penalty that could
appropriately <span style="">be </span>meted out
depended upon what <span style="">o</span>ffense was
charged and proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been stressed
by the Court that the right of an employee to procedural due process consists
of the twin rights of notice and hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The purpose of the requirement of <span style="">notice </span>is obviously to enable the
employee to defend himself against the charge preferred against him by
presenting and substantiating his version of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since <st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> here in effect charged private
respondent with a second offense other than falsification of company records,
it was incumbent upon petitioner employer to have given private respondent
additional time and opportunity to meet the new charge against him of
insubordination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> </span>failed to do that here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In so failing, <st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
failed to accord to private respondent the full measure of his right to
procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that in
the proceedings <span style="">b</span>efore the Labor
Arbiter the conduct of private respondent that petitioner regarded as
insubordination <span style="">was </span>substan­tiated,
does not militate against this conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the second issue, Article 282 of the Labor Code
provides in part:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 282.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Termination

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="SpellE">Wilful</span>
disobedience of the employer's lawful orders, as a just cause for the dismissal
of an employee, envisages the concurrence of at least two (2) requisites:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the employee's assailed conduct must have
been <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> or intentional, the <span class="SpellE">wilfulness</span>
being characterized by a "wrongful and perverse attitude"; and the
order violated must have been reasonable, lawful, made known to the employee
and must pertain to the duties which he had been engaged to discharge.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Both requisites are present in the
instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">By private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span> own
admission, he felt insulted by the <span style="">re</span>-<span style="">measurement </span>of the cargo he had already
measured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was apparently much
offended by the implication he perceived that management was uncertain either
about his honesty or his competence or possibly both.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He determined to lose his temper, became very
angry and picked a fight with one of the co-workers who had been instructed by
their common superior to carry out the re-measurement of private respondent's
pallets of bananas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the process,
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> completely disregarded the
courtesy and respect due from a subordinate to his superior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, he may have been, consciously <span style="">or </span>otherwise, precisely sending a
signal to his superior officer in whose presence he provoked and then engaged
in physical violence with his co-worker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Prior to the fistfight, <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span> had warned <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> to desist from further provoking his co-worker with
insulting language.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This warning
constituted an order from <span style="">private </span>respondent's
immediate superior not to breach the peace and order of the Surveyors' (<span class="SpellE">Admeasurers</span>') Division; <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span>
was obviously attempting <span style="">to </span>maintain
basic employee discipline in the workplace.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus not easy to understand how public respondent NLRC
could have reasonably concluded that <span class="SpellE">Guangco's</span> order
and warning were "not connected" with private respondent's work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe and <span style="">so </span>hold that private respondent's act constituted <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience to a lawful order of petitioner's
representative obviously connected with private respondent's <span style="">work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It does not follow, however, that private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span> services were lawfully terminated either under
Article 282 (a) of the Labor Code or under the CBA Schedule of penalties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that not every case of
insubordination or <span class="SpellE"><span style="">wilful</span></span><span style=""> </span>disobedience by an employee of a
lawful work-connected order of the employer or its representative <span style="">is </span>reasonably penalized with
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, Article 282
(a) refers to <span style="">"<u>serious</u> </span>misconduct
or willful disobedience ---".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
must be reasonable proportionality between, on the one hand, the <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience by the employee and, on the other hand,
the penalty imposed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examination of the circumstances surrounding
private respondent's assault upon his co-employee shows that no serious <span style="">or </span>substantial danger had been posed by
that fistfight to the well-being of his other <span style="">co-</span>employees or of the general public doing business with
petitioner employer; and neither did such behavior threaten substantial
prejudice for the business of his employer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fistfight occurred inside the offices of the Surveyors' Division
more particularly, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Guangco's</span> office, away<span style=""> </span>from the view of petitioner's
customers or of the general public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Lausa</u></span><u> v. National Labor Relations Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> exhibited disorderly and pugnacious
behavior in the course of an argument with his immediate superior, in the
presence of passengers and other crewmen <span style="">on
</span>board the inter-island vessel of which <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> <span style="">was </span>a crewmember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case<span style="">,</span> the Court sustained the dismissal of petitioner Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Lausa</span> considering that his "behavior could easily have
provoked or triggered off a brawl and mindless panic on board the vessel, and
endangered the safety of people and crewmembers, and under certain conditions,
the safety of the vessel itself".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Wenphil</u></span><u> Corporation v. National
Labor Relations Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court also sustained the dismissal of private respondent Roberto <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> who, while tending the salad bar of a fast food
restaurant, engaged in an alterca­tion a co-worker slapping the latter on the
head, stepping on his foot, brandishing an <span style="">ice </span>scooper against him and refusing to be pacified, right in
front and in plain sight of customers dining in the restaurant, thus posing a
substantial threat of disorder in the restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span> disorderly behavior did not present a comparable
threat to the safety <span style="">or </span>peace of
mind of his co-workers or that of the customers of <st1:place><st1:placename>Gold</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso's</span>
unruly temper did not become <span style="">an </span>effective
threat to his co-workers or the safety of the customers dealing with his
employer, or to the goodwill of his employer, and considering further that he
had been quite candid <span style="">in </span>admitting
that he had been at fault as soon as the investigation began in the company
level, we agree with the NLRC that termination of his services was a
disproportionately heavy penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe that suspension without <span style="">pay </span>for
three (3) months would be an adequate penalty <span style="">for </span>the assault on a co-worker and act of insubordination that
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span> actually committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows that private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bacalso</span>

Should reinstatement to his previous position not be feasible because of his
relationship or lack of relationship with his fellow <span class="SpellE">admeasurers</span>,
he should be reinstated to a substantially equivalent position in another
division of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that is not
possible or feasible either, then in lieu of such reinstatement, petitioner <span style="">shall </span>pay private respondent
separation pay equivalent to one-month's pay for every year of service.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
