JOSE M. VILLARAMA<br><br>"(T) JOSE M. VILLARAMA<br>President<br><br>"(Sgd.) JOSEFINA ALBERTO<br><br>"(T) JOSEFINA ALBERTO<br>Vendor"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">*</sup></blockquote>It is obvious that the above instrument is not a contract to sell as contended by the private respondent.&nbsp; We read it as a deed of sale in which title to the subject land was transferred to the vendee as of the date of the transaction notwithstanding that the purchase price had not yet been fully paid at that time.<br><br>In the first place, the dispositive part of the deed states that "for and in consideration of the sum of ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND (P140,000.00) PESOS, payable under the terms and conditions stated in the foregoing premises, the VENDOR sells, transfers and conveys unto the VENDEE x x x" the property in question as of December 22, 1971, the date of the said document.<br><br>Secondly, and more importantly, it is provided in paragraph 5 thereof that "should the VENDEE, prior to full payment of all the amounts aforementioned, decide to sell or to assign part or all of the aforementioned parcel of land, the VENDOR shall be informed in writing and shall have the option to repurchase the property x x x.&nbsp; Should the VENDOR herein decide to repurchase and the property is sold or transferred to a third person, the balance of the consideration herein still due to the VENDOR shall constitute automatically a prior lien on the consideration to be paid by the third person to herein VENDEE."<br><br>Under the first-cited stipulation, what is deferred is not the transfer of ownership but the full payment of the purchase price, which is to be made in installments, on the dates indicated.&nbsp; Under the second stipulation, it is recognized that the vendee may sell the property even "prior to full payment of all the amounts aforementioned," which simply means that although the purchase price had not yet been completely paid, the vendee had already become the owner of the land.&nbsp; As such, he could sell the same, subject to the right of repurchase reserved to the vendor.&nbsp; In fact, the contract also provides for the possibility of the vendee selling the property to a third person, in which case the vendor, if she wishes to repurchase the land, shall have a lien on any balance of the consideration to be paid by the third person to the vendee.<br><br>But all this notwithstanding, we agree with the trial court, as sustained by the respondent court, that Villarama acted with less than good faith and candor when he secured the cancellation of the vendor's certificate of title and replaced it with one in his name without even informing the complainant about it.&nbsp; Worse, he thereafter mortgaged the property, also without her knowledge, and then, to add insult to injury, also omitted to advise her that it had been sold at public auction because he had defaulted in the payment of his mortgage debt.&nbsp; He did not even share the P350,000.00 loan with her and pay her therefrom the P100,000.00 balance of the purchase price.<br><br>All the while, the plaintiff had thought Villarama had taken TCT No. 87322 from her only for the purpose of having the deed of sale annotated thereon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> She believed, not being a lawyer, that title to the property would not pass to the vendee until the purchase price had been paid in full.&nbsp; The deed of sale, as the plaintiff testified, had been drawn up by the legal staff of Villa Rey Transit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As far as she understood it, the land she was selling would pass to Villa Rey Transit only after the purchase price had been paid in full.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It is true that she should have consulted a lawyer of her own to advise her and protect her interests, but the fact is she did not.&nbsp; She just left the drafting of the deed to Villarama, whom she trusted.&nbsp; This circumstance alone imposed upon Villarama the moral if not legal responsibility to explain the meaning and consequences of the contract she was signing.&nbsp; But he did not discharge this responsibility.&nbsp; On the contrary, what he did was take advantage of the private respondent's confidence and use the subject property to enable him to secure the loan he did not repay.<br><br>The fact that he mortgaged the property the very day he secured the transfer certificate in his name is meaningful, if not suspicious.&nbsp; It suggests that he had meant all the while to use the transaction with the complainant to support the loan he was then negotiating with Filoil, and that his purpose was not only not to inform the plaintiff about it but indeed to conceal it from her to prevent her from obstructing his plan.&nbsp; While, in the strict legal sense, Villarama had the right as owner to mortgage the property to Filoil, we feel he did so with demonstrated bad faith toward the private respondent, who had placed her confidence in him.<br><br>At any rate, Villarama has not appealed the decision of the trial court and is now deemed to have accepted it, including the imputation to him of malice and deceit, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<br><br>What we are concerned with in this petition is the appeal of Filoil, the other defendant which has been held solidarily liable with Villarama and Villa Rey Transit.&nbsp; Filoil, the herein petitioner, claims the status of an innocent purchaser for value and insists that the deed of sale is not subject to rescission as far as it is concerned.&nbsp; Moreover, even assuming that the contract is rescissible as between Pabalan and Villa Rey Transit, it cannot now be canceled as to the petitioner because it had no participation therein.<br><br>Legally speaking, except only for the circumstance that Villarama and Villa Rey Transit have not appealed to this Court, the rescission could not have been valid even as to them under the Civil Code.&nbsp; The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the contract of sale was subject to rescission on the ground of non-compliance with one of its conditions, presumably the payment of the purchase price, under Article 1191 of the said Code.&nbsp; That ground was merely assumed and not established.&nbsp; In fact, it did not exist at the time of the filing of the complaint.<br><br>Under the provisions of the deed, the purchase price of P100,000.00 was to be paid in annual installments of P10,000.00, beginning 1972, except that there was to be an advance payment of P40,000.00 covering the installments for 1972 until 1975.&nbsp; It is not denied by Pabalan that she received this advance payment.&nbsp; Payment in installments of the balance of P100,000.00 would thus begin only in 1976.&nbsp; Hence, when Pabalan filed her complaint for rescission in 1974, the contract could not yet be faulted for non-performance by the vendee of its obligation to pay the balance of the purchase price.<br><br>It follows that if the contract was not rescissible as to the other defendants (who are nevertheless bound by the decision of the respondent court), much less would it be rescissible as to the petitioner, which was not even a party to that contract.<br><br>We nevertheless must examine Filoil's defense of an innocent purchaser for value, as the private respondent contends that it was privy to the plans of Villarama and Villa Rey Transit and so equally liable with them to her in damages.<br><br>It is noted that at the time the contract of sale between Pabalan and Villa Rey was concluded on December 22, 1971, the subject property was under lease to and occupied by Filoil.&nbsp; Filoil had earlier recognized that the owner of the land was Pabalan, who had been its lessor since 1960.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when that same land (which it continued to occupy by virtue of the lease) was later mortgaged to it, the registered owner thereof had been changed and now appeared to be Villarama, who had TCT No. 94229 to prove it.&nbsp; Filoil seems to have accepted this change without question.<br><br>It is curious that despite this important development which directly affected its lease, Filoil appears to have done nothing at all to verify it.&nbsp; Filoil could have at least checked with Pabalan about the matter if only because of their existing contract of lease.&nbsp; It is also strange that Villarama's deed of mortgage over the property was executed, as if by pre-arrangement with Filoil, on the very day he obtained the transfer certificate in his own name.&nbsp; The decision to extend the not inconsiderable loan of P350,000.00 to Villarama seems to have been readily made by Filoil, on the spur of the moment as it were.<br><br>Somehow Filoil's claim that it was ignorant of Villarama's acts <i>vis-a-vis</i> Pabalan does not ring true.&nbsp; We are not convinced when it insists it had a right to rely alone on the assurances of the mortgagor and its own examination of the transfer certificate of title that the subject land was unencumbered save for the lease in its favor.&nbsp; The doctrine it invokes,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> while normally acceptable, is not exactly applicable in this case.&nbsp; We feel that more vigilance was required of Filoil under the circumstances.&nbsp; As a business corporation with its own legal staff, and in view of its direct involvement as the actual occupant and lessee of the disputed land, it was bound to inquire more closely into the antecedents of its transfer to Villarama.&nbsp; Filoil had the legal staff to do this but it did not see fit to probe further.&nbsp; This omission might fuel the suspicion that Filoil already knew about Villarama's plans and was in effect going along with him as its new landlord and prospective borrower.<br><br>Given this situation, the Court hesitates to fully accept Filoil's wounded claim of innocence.&nbsp; At the same time, however, we are also not certain it was deliberately involved in the scheme of the other defendants to take advantage of the private respondent.&nbsp; In fine, while we are not prepared to acknowledge its claimed naivete, neither are we disposed, in fairness, to denounce its alleged malice.<br><br>But one thing is certain in this maze of surmises and suspicions.&nbsp; We find that the petitioner, if not knowingly involved in the scheme to deceive Pabalan, was at least negligent in not closely examining the facts before accepting the land as security for the loan to Villa Rey Transit.&nbsp; Filoil must bear the consequences of its own omission.&nbsp; But more than this, it must also share the blame for the injury suffered by the private respondent, who now finds herself with neither the disputed property nor the balance of the purchase price.&nbsp; Whether or not it acted in good faith, Filoil must also be held liable to Pabalan, albeit not in equal degree with Villarama and Villa Rey Transit, for its part in her deception.<br><br>On page 33 of its brief,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the petitioner makes the following statement:<br><blockquote>"Be this as it may, the circumstance that the lawyers of Filoil could have discovered that the sale is on installment basis, would, given the most favorable implication in favor of the vendor, at most render Filoil liable for the unpaid balance of the purchase price in the amount of P100,000.00."</blockquote>Considering the antecedents of this case as above discussed, the Court will accept this expressed willingness of Filoil to make amends, to the extent indicated and offered.&nbsp; Accordingly, we hereby order the petitioner to pay the private respondent, in atonement for its part in the impairment of her interests, the balance of the purchase price in the sum of P100,000.00 plus interest.&nbsp; Its payment was not decreed by the Court of Appeals because it had rescinded the contract instead; hence, it is not recoverable from Villarama and Villa Rey Transit under the challenged decision.&nbsp; As it does not appear in the record that this amount has been received by Pabalan from them, it is only fair that Filoil pay her this balance now, subject to its right to demand reimbursement from Villarama and Villa Rey Transit in a separate appropriate action.&nbsp; What is important is that, in justice to the private respondent, she should not be left holding the bag, so to speak, and without recourse to collect this amount.<br><br>Filoil's obligation includes the payment of interest at 6% per annum beginning 1976 and until the balance of P100,000.00 is fully settled, to be compounded yearly, on the annual installments of P10.000.00 stipulated in the contract of sale.&nbsp; As of December 31, 1988, the total amount due to Pabalan from Filoil on the balance plus interest is P166,404.63.<br><br>For the reasons already given, Filoil is absolved from all other liabilities under the challenged decision.&nbsp; The award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney's fees shall be enforceable only on the other defendants pursuant to the said decision.&nbsp; TCT No. 94229 is declared valid as to Filoil.&nbsp; The deed of mortgage and the auction sale of the disputed land in its favor are also recognized as lawful and entitle Filoil now, in view of the lapse of the redemption period, to register the property in its name.<br><br>Corporations and businessmen should exercise more fairness in dealing with ordinary persons, especially if they do not have the assistance and advice of counsel.&nbsp; Such persons are not likely to read the fine print in a contract or to understand the instruments they are signing unless they are properly informed of the implications of their unsuspecting and heedless acts.&nbsp; This is not to say that such instruments are <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> invalid without such explanation.&nbsp; What it simply means is that in proper cases, like the one at bar, contracts should be read in the light of the layman's understanding of their esoteric legal language, that they may not ensnare him, because of his trusting lack of caution, in their intricate stipulations.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the challenged decision is modified as applied to the petitioner in the sense that:<br><br>(1) TCT No. 94229, the deed of mortgage and the foreclosure sale in its favor over the subject land are declared valid.<br><br>(2) The petitioner shall pay the private respondent the sum of P166,404.63, representing the balance of the purchase price and 6% interest thereon as of December 31, 1988, plus 6% interest from that date until full payment is made.<br><br>(3) The award against it of moral and exemplary damages and the attorney's fees is disallowed.<br><br>This decision is immediately executory.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">SO ORDERED. </span><br><br><i>Narvasa, (Chairman), Gancayco, Griño-Aquino,</i> and <i>Medialdea, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Exhibit 1, list of exhibits for defendant Filoil.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> TSN, June 16, 1977, p. 28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Exhibit 2, list of exhibits for defendant Filoil.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Exhibit 3, list of exhibits for defendant Filoil.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Annex D, Record on Appeal.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Annex D-1, Record on Appeal.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Exhibit 5, list of exhibits for defendant Filoil.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Annex A, Original Records, p. 7.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Ibid., pp. 9-13.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Annex 2, Original Records, pp. 17-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Annex D, Original Records, pp. 26-32.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Presided by Judge Narciso A.
