to the President of the Philippines (by 1st <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>,
dated August 25, 1975, this case was referred by the Office of the President to
this Court, pursuant to Section 7, Article X of the Constitution), by <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers Martin <span class="SpellE">Lantaco</span>,
Sr., Esteban del Barrio, <span class="SpellE">Rosalito</span> <span class="SpellE">Alamag</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitaliano</span>, all
residents of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, against City Judge Francisco
R. Llamas of the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Court for
"Backsliding and Grave Abuse of Discretion."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1975</st1:date>,
an investigating special counsel of the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> <span class="GramE">City,</span> filed
Criminal Cases Nos. 95647, 95648, 95649 and 95650, all for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, an officer of the <span class="SpellE">PASCAMASCON</span>, an association of <span class="SpellE">jeep­ney</span>
operators, for "<span class="SpellE">nonremittance</span> of <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> contribution premiums." These cases were assigned
to respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the prosecution had
rested its case, the defense moved to dismiss all the criminal cases on the
ground that the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to convict
the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution opposed the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the complainants, the respondent set the promulgation of
his decision on July 22, 1975, postponed to July 30, 1975 and again to July 31,
1975, when at about 9:45 in the morning, upon respondent's instruc­tion, his
clerk of court read the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof
acquitting the accused of all four <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases on
the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the herein complainants:</p>

<blockquote>"After the reading of (the) Decision a recess was made by
Judge Llamas and we requested Judge Llamas to furnish us a copy of said
Decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Llamas told us that
there are no more copy and we told Judge Llamas if there is no more copy we
would like to <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> the original and Judge Llamas
told us that <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy are not permitted and Judge
Llamas in­structed one of the employees in his office – a steno- typist to type
another copy for us and that the typist told us to come back on Monday, August
4, which we did, but, the steno-typist failed to furnish us the copy as agreed
by us and told us again to come back next day, August 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning we went back to the office
of Judge Llamas, same <span style="">we </span>failed
to get copy of the Decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1975</st1:date>
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 A.M.</st1:time> one of the
complainants, Esteban <span class="GramE">del</span> Barrio and <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Ginete</span>, the President<span style=""> </span>of our labor union went to Judge
Llamas to secure copy of said decision to (sic) the same person - the
steno-typist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The steno-typist went
inside the room of Judge Llamas and a few minutes the typist went back to us
and informed us that he could not type the Decision because the folder is at
the house of Judge Llamas and when Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ginete</span> inquire
why the said folder of the complainants are at the house of Judge Llamas, the
typist reply the Judge making 'CORRECTION.' Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ginete</span>
<span class="GramE">wonder</span> why a correction is being made when the
decision has already been rendered and why the delay in fur­nishing us copy,
WHY?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court required the respondent to comment on the complaint by
2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court also sent by registered mails a follow-up letter dated <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1975</st1:date> and a tracer letter
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Bureau of Posts in a certification dated <st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1975</st1:date> certified that
these follow-up letters were delivered to and received by the office of the
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1976</st1:date>
this Court received respondent's comment dated <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His brief comment:</p>

<blockquote>"The four related criminal accusa­tions against Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Paredes</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
were validly and properly decided by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to dismiss after the prosecution's
case was <span class="GramE">rested,</span> was resolved and said resolution of
acquittal is the very decision in this case which was validly promulgated in
the presence of the accused, the prosecuting fiscal and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ginete</span> and all the complaining parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The records of the decision
show that the accused assisted by counsel signed the same on said date and
copies thereafter furnished counsel for the accused and the prosecuting
fiscal."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent also averred:</p>

<blockquote>"It is respectfully submitted that on the details of the
proceedings and the evidence presented, no better answer could be made by the
undersigned except by submitting a copy of said decision <span class="SpellE">pormulgated</span>
July 31, 1975 and marked as Annex 'A' of this comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same breath, <u>the matter of the
advisa­bility as suggested that this finding by this Court be reviewed by the
Military may best be answered by a thorough read­ing of the decision</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the records before this Court, We
found that respondent committed grave abuse of authority in refusing to give
the complainants a copy of his decision in Criminal Cases Nos. 95647­-95650.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainants were understandably
interested in securing a copy of the decision as they were the complaining
witnesses in these four criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The request was made during office hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was relayed personally to the
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision in question was
already promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Copies were already
furnished the counsel for the prosecution and the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was already part of the public record
which the citizen has a right to scrutinize.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if there was "no more copy," the complainants were
amenable to have a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the original on
file, copies of which, as part of court records, are allowed to be given to
interested parties upon request, duly certified as a true copy of the original
on file.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What aggravates the situation,
as seen from the sequence of events narrated by the complainants <span class="GramE">which</span> were never denied or rebutted by the respondent, is
that respondent, without just cause, denied complainants access to public
records and gave the complainants the run-around, which is oppressive as it is
arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Baldoza</span>
vs. Honor­able Judge Rodolfo B. <span class="SpellE">Dimaano</span> (A.M. No.
112-MJ, May 5, 1976), WE emphasized the importance of access to public records,
predicated as it is on the right of the people to acquire information on
matters of public concern in which the public has a legitimate interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the public officers in custody or
control of public records have the discretion to regulate the manner in which
such records may be inspected, examined or copied by interested persons, such
discretion does not carry with it the authority to prohibit such access,
inspection, examination or copying.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Continuing, said this Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The New Constitution now expressly recognizes that the people
are entitled to information on matters of public concern and thus are expressly
granted access to official records, as well as documents of official acts, or
transactions, or decisions, subject to such limitations imposed by law (Article
IV, Section 6, <span class="GramE">New</span> Constitution).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incorporation of this right in the
Constitution is <span class="GramE">a recognition</span> of the fundamental role
of free exchange of information in <span style="">a </span>democracy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no realistic perception by the
public of the nation's problems, <span class="GramE">nor</span> a meaningful
democratic decision-making if they are denied access to information of general
interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Information is needed to
enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As has been aptly observed:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Maintaining the flow of such information
depends on protection for both its acquisition and its dissemina­tion since, if
either process is interrupted, the flow inevitably ceases.' (87 Harvard Law <span class="GramE">Review</span> 1505)" [<span class="SpellE">Baldoza</span> vs.
Hon. Judge Rodolfo B. <span class="SpellE">Dimaano</span>, <span style="">A.M. No. </span>112-MJ, <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="5"><span style="">May </span>5, 1976</st1:date>].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The herein complainants
prayed that respondent's decision be reviewed "to obviate any miscarriage
of justice considering the adverse effects to the thousands of <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers and to prevent the other <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> operators in using (sic) the Decision x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> for their own benefits."
The respondent commented that "no better answer could be made x <span class="SpellE">x</span> except by submitting a copy of the decision" and the
complaint "may best be answered by a thorough reading of the
decision."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">OUR "review" in
administrative cases of this nature as defined in <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pamaran</span> (<span class="SpellE">A.C</span>. </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">200-J, June 10, 1971, 39 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 430, 433), is
limited to the text of the decision and respondent's articulations on the law
and the evidence submitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE do not
review the decision to reverse it or to set it aside as if it were brought to
this Court on regular appeal; for this is beyond the objective of an
administrative proceedings to protect the public service, to secure the
faithful and efficient performance of official functions, and to rid the public
service of incompetent, corrupt and unworthy public servants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">WE have carefully read, examined and analyzed the decision
submitted by the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE found
that in sustaining the motion to dismiss on the ground of insufficiency of
evidence after the prosecution rested its case, respondent committed several
errors bordering on gross ignorance of the law.</p>

<p class="NUM">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent erred in
concluding that the prose­cution failed to prove that the accused, despite
repeated demands, refused and still refuses to remit the alleged collected
premium contributions and that "if no demand was ever made x <span class="SpellE">x</span>, then a criminal prosecution for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> could not
prosper."</p>

<p class="BODY">The uniform allegation in all the four <span class="SpellE">informa­tions</span>
for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> that "the accused, despite repeated
demands, refused and still refuses to remit x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>," need not anymore be proved by the prosecution;
because the Social Security Act of 1954 (<span class="SpellE">R.A</span>. No.
1161, as amended by <span class="SpellE">R.A</span>. No. 1792, No. 2658 and No.
3839, and further amended by Presidential Decrees Nos. 24, 65 and 177), makes
it the duty of the employer to remit the contributions without need of any
demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by the employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 22(a), (b), (c) and (d) of said Act,
governing "Remittance of Contributions" requires as a legal
obligation of every employer to remit within the first seven (7) days of the
month the contributions of the employee and the employer to the Social Security
System, failing which invites the imposition of a penalty of three percent
(3%).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this mandate of the law,
demand on the part of the employee before the employer remits these contri­butions
to the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> is not a condition precedent for such
remittance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Social Security System
can collect such contributions in the same manner as taxes are made collectible
under the National Internal Revenue Code (Sec. 22 [b], Social Security
Act).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 22.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u><span style="color: windowtext;">Remittance of
contributions</span></u>.</span> - (a) <u>The contributions imposed in the pro­ceeding
sections shall be remitted to the </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">SSS</span></u></span><u><span style=""> within the first seven days of each calendar
month following the month for which they are applicable</span></u><span style=""> or within such time as the Commission may
prescribe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Every employer required to
deduct and to remit such contributions shall be liable for their payment,</u>
and <u>if any contribution is not paid to the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span>, as
herein prescribed, he shall pay besides the contribution a penalty thereon</u>
of three per cent per month from the date the contribution falls due until
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If deemed expedient and
advisable by the Commission</u>, the collection and remittance of contribu­tions
shall be made quarterly or semi­annually in advance, <u>the contributions </u></span><u><span style="">payable by the employees to be advanced </span></u><u><span style="">by their respective employers</span></u><span style="">:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, <span class="GramE">That</span> upon separation of an employee,
any contributions so paid in advance but not due shall be credited or refunded
to his employer.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The contributions payable</u> under this
Act in cases <u>where an employer refuses </u><u><span style="">or neglects to pay the same shall be collected by the System in the
same manner as taxes are made collectible under the National Internal Revenue
Code, as amended</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Failure or refusal of the employer to pay
or remit the contribu­tions herein prescribed shall not prejudice the right of

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For purposes of this section, any employer who
is delinquent or has not remitted all the monthly contributions due and payable
may within six (6) months from approval of this amendatory act remit said
contributions to the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> and submit the corresponding
collection lists <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> without incurring the
prescribed three per cent penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In
case the employer fails to remit to the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> the said
contributions</u> within the <span style="">six </span>months
grace period, <u>the </u><u><span style="">penalty of
three per cent shall be imposed from the time the contributions first became
due</span></u><span style=""> as provided in paragraph
(a) of this section:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however,
That the Administrator, may in meritorious cases, allow employers who have <span style="">submitted </span>a payment plan, on or before
April 19, 1973, to pay their contributions due and payable up to December 31,
1973 without incurring the prescribed three per cent penalty." (As amended
by Rep. Act No. <span class="GramE">2658,</span> and by Pres. Decrees Nos. 24 and
177).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To prove remittance, the employer can submit his records thereon
or a certification from the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> as to the fact of
remittance of the contributions.</p>

<p class="NUM">II.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent likewise
erred in concluding that, in connection with the daily deductions of <span style="">P0.50 as </span><span class="SpellE">SSS</span>
premium contributions, "this Court is not convinced and could not
reasonably believe that there was a forced <span style="">daily deductions or exaction of P0.50."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18 of the Social Security Act governing employees'
contribution, provides that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> the <u>employer
shall deduct and withhold from such employee's</u> monthly salary, wage,
compensation or <u>earnings the employee's contribution</u> in an amount
corresponding to his salary, wage, compensation or earnings during the month in
accordance with the following schedule effective on January 1, 1973 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>." With this legal obligation placed on the
employer's shoulder, respondent's reasonable <span style="">belief </span>that "there was or could be no forced daily deductions
or exaction of P0.50" would have no legal basis and support.</p>

<p class="NUM">III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent again erred
in finding "that from the existing relationship between the accused as
owner of the utility <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> and all the
complainants, there is categorically demonstrated no employer-employee
relationship in contemplation of the Social Security Act of 1954, as amended by
Presidential Decrees Nos. 24, 65 and 177.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, if by law there <span style="">exists
no </span>such relationship, then the herein accused truly is not even
obligated to collect such amounts; neither <span style="">is he </span>under obligation to make remittance payments."</p>

<p class="BODY">For, as early as March 23, 1956, in National Labor Union vs. <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> (L-7945),
this <span style="">Court already ruled that there is
employer-employee relation between <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
owners/operators and <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers under the
boundary system arrangement, and enunciated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The main question to determine is whether there exists a
relationship of employer-employee between the drivers of the jeeps and the
owner thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings contained in
the first order are not disputed by both parties except the last to which the
respondent took exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in the
resolution setting aside the order of <st1:date year="1954" day="16" month="2">16
 February <span style="">1954</span></st1:date><span style=""> the Court of Industrial Relations <u>in</u> <u>banc</u>
did not state that such finding is not supported by evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It merely 'declares that there is no employer-employee
relation between respondent, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, and the driver-complainants in this case.' If
the findings to which the respondent took exception <span class="GramE">is</span>
unsupported by the evidence, a pronouncement to that effect would have been
made by the Court <u>in</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence of such pronouncement we are not at liberty to ignore or
disregard said finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of
the Court of Industrial Relations with respect to question of fact, if
supported by substantial evidence on the record shall be conclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Taking into consideration the findings of
fact made by the Court of Industrial Relations we find it difficult to uphold
the conclusion of the Court set forth in its resolution of </span><st1:date year="1954" day="23" month="6"><span style="">23 June
 1954</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The drivers did not invest a single centavo
in the business and the respondent is the exclusive owner of the jeeps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The management of the business is in the
respondent's hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For even if the
drivers of the jeeps take material possession of the jeeps, still the
respondent as owner thereof and holder of a certificate of </span>public
convenience is entitled to exercise, as he does and under the law he must,
supervision over the drivers by seeing to it that they follow the route
prescribed by the Public Service Commission and the rules and regulations
promulgated by it as regards their operation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And when they pass by the gasoline station of the respondent checking by
his employees on the water tank, oil and tire pressure is done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only features that would make the
relationship of <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and lessee between the
respondent and the drivers, members of the union, as con­tended by the
respondent, are the fact that he does not pay them any fixed wage but their
compensation is the excess of the total amount of P7.50 which they agreed to
pay to the re­spondent, the owner of the jeeps, and the fact that the gasoline
burned by the jeeps is for the account of the drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two features are not, however,
sufficient to withdraw the relationship between them from that of employer-employee,
because the estimated earnings for fares must be over and above the amount they
agreed to pay to the respondent for a ten-hour shift or ten-hour a day
operation of the jeeps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not having any
interest in the business because they did not invest anything in the
acquisition of the jeeps and did not participate in the management thereof,
their service as drivers of the jeeps being their only contribution to the
business, the relationship of <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and lessee
cannot be sustained [In the matter of the Park Floral Company, etc., 19 NLRB

although the lessee cannot make bad use thereof, for he <span style="">would be responsible for damages to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
should he do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case there is <span class="GramE">a supervision</span> and a sort of control that the owner of the
jeeps exercises over the drivers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
an attempt by ingenious scheme to withdraw the relationship between the owner
of the jeeps and the drivers thereof from the operation of the labor laws
enacted to promote industrial peace." <span class="GramE">(98 Phil. 650,

the excess of the receipt of fares collected by him over the amount he pays to
the jeep-owner and that the gasoline consumed by the jeep is for the account of
the driver -- are not sufficient to withdraw the relation­ship between them
from that of employer and employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
ruling was subsequently cited and applied in <span class="SpellE">Doce</span> v. <span style="">Workmen's Compensation Commission, L-9417, </span><st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="12"><span class="GramE"><span style="">December</span></span><span style=""> 22, 1958</span></st1:date><span style="">, which involved the liability of a bus owner
for injury compensation to a conductor working under the 'boundary system.' <span class="GramE">" (</span>7 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 953-54).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indeed, considering that
about nineteen (19) years before July 31, 1975, when respondent rendered his
decision in the four <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases, it was a settled
doctrine that an employer-employee relationship exists between <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> owners/operators and <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
drivers under the boundary system arrange­ment, of which rule respondent was
obviously ignorant (Section 1, Rule 129, Rules of Court, and in line with
Municipal Board of Manila vs. Agustin, 65 Phil. 144).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent mistakenly relied on the cases of Social Security
System vs. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> (37 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 579) and Social Security System vs. Court of Appeals
and Manila Jockey Club (30 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 210), which have no
bearing on or relevance to the issue posed in the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
cases filed by the complainants and heard by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> and the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place>
<span class="GramE">jockey</span> Club cases did not involve or resolve the
relationship between <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> owners/operators and <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers in any manner whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> case
concerned the relationship of "commission sales agents" and <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> (<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
Inc., the exclusive distributor of "Regal" sewing machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila Jockey Club, Inc. case concerned
jockeys who are connected with <span style="">the
Manila Jockey Club, Inc. and the Philippine Racing Club, Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since an employer-employee relationship subsists between the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> owners/operators and <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
drivers under the boundary system arrangement, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">SSS</span></span><span style=""> </span>coverage
"shall be compulsory" (Sec. 9, Social Security Act), the <span class="SpellE">SSS's</span> deduction would follow as <span style="">a matter </span>of<span style=""> law </span><span style="">(Sec. </span><span style="">18, supra), and the accused in the four <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases, without previous demand by the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> drivers, is under legal obligation to remit the
driver's contri­bution to the <span class="SpellE">SSS</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Decisions of the Supreme Court need not be proved as they are
matters of judicial notice <span style="">(Sec. </span>1, Rule 129, Rev. Rules of Court; V Moran, Rules of Court,
1970 ed., pp. 38-39).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignorance of the
law excuses no one (Art. 3, New Civil Code) and judicial decisions applying or
interpreting the law or the Constitution <span style="">are
part of the legal system (Art. 8, </span><span style="">New Civil </span><span style="">Code).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the above
discussion, respond­ent gravely erred in sustaining the motion to dismiss the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> cases by conveniently relying on the accepted axiom
that the prosecution cannot rely on the weakness of the defense to gain
conviction, for conviction can only rest upon the strength of the prosecution
evidence (Duran vs. Court of Appeals, L-39758, May 7, 1976, citing People vs.
Barrera, 82 Phil. 391), and, as </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">consequence, material and moral
damages had been inflicted on the numerous complaining drivers whose rights to <span class="SpellE">refile</span> the criminal cases for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
against the accused are now foreclosed by </span><span style="">the rule on double jeopardy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In recapitulation, We
find that respondent exhibited gross ignorance of the Social Security </span><span style="">Act of 1954, as amended, particularly the
sections governing <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> compulsory coverage,
employer-employee contributions, deduction of <span class="SpellE">SSS's</span>
contributions, and remittance of <span class="SpellE">SSS</span> contributions;
and of the settled jurisprudence that the relationship between <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> owners/operators and <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
drivers under the boundary system arrangement </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">that of </span><span style="">employer and employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Or,
if respondent </span><span style="">was aware </span><span style="">of them, he deliberately refrained from
applying them, which can never be excused (<span class="SpellE">Quizon</span>, et
al. vs. Judge Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr., <span class="SpellE">A.C</span>. No. 532-MJ, July 25, 1975) and "is hardly to be
condoned" (Fernando, J., concurring opinion, <span class="SpellE">Quizon</span>,
et al. vs. Judge <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>, Jr., supra).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE, moreover, find that
respondent repeatedly ignored this Court's directive to file his comment on the
instant complaint within ten (10) days from receipt of our 2nd <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9"><span style="">September 16, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, necessita­ting the sending of two tracer
letters dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="10"><span style="">October 23, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> and </span><st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="11"><span style="">November 25, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">His </span><span style="">comment came only on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">His failure to submit the required comment </span><span style="">within the period fixed </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">disrespect to the Court as well as aggravated the delay in the speedy and
orderly dispo­sition of this administrative complaint (cf. Medina, etc., et al.
vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>, etc., et al., L-38810, March 25,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERA, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge has been charged by the four complainants herein
with "backsliding" and "grave abuse of discretion".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Backsliding" for his refusal to
give complainants a copy of his Decision acquitting the accused, Ricardo
Paredes, in four separate criminal accusations for Estafa filed before the City
Court of Pasay, Branch IV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">And "grave abuse of discretion" for rendering a verdict
of acquittal, on the ground of reasonable doubt, in spite of the "strong
evi­dence" against the accused.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Executive <span class="GramE">Judge,</span> concurred in by the
Court Administrator, recommended dismissal of the charges for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority has voted for dis­missal
from the service on the principal grounds that respondent committed grave <span style="">abuse </span>of authority in refusing to give
complainants a copy of his Decision in the aforestated criminal cases and
because, in acquitting the accused for insufficiency of the prosecution
evidence, respondent committed errors bordering on gross ignorance of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree that respondent was not justified in refusing to give
complainants a copy of his Decision for which he can be held administratively
accountable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in so far as the
verdict of acquittal is concerned, I believe that respondent can only be
faulted with error of judgment in appraising the evidence and applying
doctrinal jurisprudence, for which he should not be held administratively
liable and much less dismissed from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Pabalan vs. Guevarra (Adm. Matter No. 333-CJ, 74
SCRA 53 [1976]), <span style="">we </span>held that a
judicial officer <span style="">cannot be</span>
called to account in civil or administrative actions for acts done <span style="">in </span>the <span style="">exercise </span>of his judicial function, however erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by then Justice Fernando, now
the Chief Justice, in the cases of Bartolome vs. Hon. Juan de Borja and Grego
vs. Hon. Juan de Borja, "even on the assumption that his interpretation
was erroneous, still he could not be held accountable for gross ignorance of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the most, he could have been
mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That does
not render him liable to administrative sanction" (Adm. Matter No.
1096-CFI; Adm. Matter No. 1114-CFI, 71 SCRA 154 [1976]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">No one, called upon to try the facts or interpret the law in the
process of administering justice can be infallible in his judgment (Vda. de
Zabala vs. Pamaran (Adm. Case No. 200-J, 39 SCRA 430-431 [1971]). "To hold
a Judge administratively accountable for every erroneous ruling or decision he
renders, assuming that he has erred, would be nothing short of harrassment and
would make his position unbearable." <span class="GramE">(Barroso vs. Arche
(Adm. Case No. 216-CFI, 67 SCRA 161, 162 [1975]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">To hold respondent City Judge administratively liable for
ignorance of the law, there must be reliable evidence to show that the judicial
acts complained of were ill-motivated, corrupt or inspired by a persistent
disregard of well-known rules (Ajeno vs. Inserto, Adm. Matter No.1098-CFI, 71
SCRA 166 [1976]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a Judge to be
culpable in an administrative <span class="GramE">proceeding,</span> there should
be a clear and sufficient evidence of his misconduct (In re Horrileno, 43 Phil.
212, 1922 cited in Fr. Cabillo vs. Mun. <span class="GramE">Judge Celis, Adm.
Matter No. 825-MJ, 83 SCRA 620 [1978]).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing here­in that respondent Judge willfully perverted
his position to inflict a deliberate wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent is the showing of bad faith or improper considerations.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, vote to impose suspension for three (3)
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge acted
arbitrarily, oppressively and unjustifiedly in refusing to give complainants a
copy of his adverse Decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
also shown disrespect to this Court when he had repeatedly ignored its
directive to submit his comment to the subject complaint.</p>
