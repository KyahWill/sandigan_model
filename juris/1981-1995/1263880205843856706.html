				<H3>TEODORO G. BARROZO, PETITIONER, VS. THE CIVIL
SERVICE COMMISSION AND VALENTINO L. JULIAN, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The facts of this case are familiar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They involve the same arrogation of power by
the public respondent that we have rejected in earlier cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 10, 1988, David G. Borja retired as City Engineer of
Baguio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, petitioner Teodoro
G. Barrozo was a Senior Civil Engineer of the Department of Public Works and
Highways assigned to the office of the City Engineer of Baguio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Valentino L. Julian was
the Assistant City Engineer of Baguio.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 27, 1988, Mayor Ramon L. Labo, Jr. extended to the
petitioner a permanent appointment as City Engineer of Baguio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This appointment was approved by the Civil
Service Regional Office No. 1 on January 2, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On February 16, 1989, after his protest was
rejected by Mayor Labo, the private respondent appealed the appointment to the
Merit Systems Board of the Civil Service Commission, claiming that as a
qualified next-in-rank officer, he had pre-emptive rights over the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 22, 1989, the
Civil Service Commission Cordillera Administrative Region (CSC-CAR), to which
the appeal was referred, declared the petitioner’s appointment void for being
violative of Civil Service promotion rules.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His motion for reconsideration having been denied, the petitioner then
appealed to the Civil Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On March 5, 1990, the public respondent issued the resolution now under
challenge.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion for reconsideration thereof was denied on May 23, 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The text of the resolution carried the significant statement that
“a comparative analysis of the qualifications of the contestants shows that
both meet the minimum requirements for the position of City Engineer.” The
Commission also found, however, that -</p>

<blockquote>There is no showing that Julian who is next-in-rank to the
contested position is barred by law or suffers from any legal disqualification
to occupy the position of City <span style="">Engineer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there any showing that Barrozo
possesses far superior qualifications nor special reasons cited by the
appointing authority why Julian cannot be promoted to the higher position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the Commission finds the
appointment of Barrozo not in accordance with Civil Service Law, rules and
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, it is
significant to stress that while the appointing authority enjoys a wide
latitude of discretion in the selection of personnel for his agency,
nevertheless such discretion must be exercised within the confines of Civil
Service </span>Law, <span style="">rules and
regulations.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It therefore disposed as follow:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, foregoing premises considered, the Commission resolved
to dismiss as it hereby dismisses the instant appeal of Teodoro Barrozo for
lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the CSC-CAR
decision dated November 22, 1989 is affirmed insofar as the revocation of the
appointment of Barrozo is concerned but sets aside said decision insofar as
subjecting the contestants to screening and evaluation by the Personnel <span style="">Selection Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hereby directed that Valentino L.
Julian be appointed to the position of City Engineer of Baguio.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We note that the Commission has once again <u><span style="">directed</span></u><span style=""> </span>the appointment of its own choice contrary to our consistent
ruling on this matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only recently, in
Lapinid v. Civil Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
we again emphasized:</p>

<blockquote>We declare once again, and let us hope for the last time, that the
Civil Service Commission has no power of appointment except <span style="">over its own personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it have the authority to review
the appointments made by other offices except </span><span style="">only </span><span style="">to ascertain if the
appointee possesses the required </span>qualifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The determination of who among aspirants with
the minimum statutory qualifications should be preferred belongs to <span style="">the appointing authority and not the Civil
Service Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot disallow
an appointment because it believes another person is better qualified and much
less can it direct the appointment of its own choice.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appointment is a highly discretionary act that even this Court
cannot compel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the act of
appointment may in proper cases be the subject of <i><u>mandamus</u></i>, the
selection itself of the appointee - taking into account the totality of his
qualifications, including those abstract qualities that define his personality
- is the prerogative of the appointing <span style="">authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a matter addressed only to the
discretion of the appointing authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a political question that the Civil Service Commission has no
power to review under the Constitution and the applicable laws.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment, the Solicitor General has taken a stand against
the respondent Commission, relying on the above-stated doctrine as earlier
enunciated in the leading case of Luego v. Civil Service Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and only recently in Gaspar v. Civil Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Teologo v. Civil Service Commission<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and Patagoc v. Civil Service Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In fairness, however, he also moved that the Commission be given an opportunity
to submit its own Comment in defense of its own decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent has done so and insists
that since the disputed vacancy was being filled by promotion, it was
imperative that the next-in-rank rule be observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disregard of that rule called for the
disapproval of the petitioner’s appointment in favor of the private respondent,
who was the Assistant City Engineer of Baguio at the time the controversial
vacancy occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is not well-taken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The law does not absolutely require that the person who is next in rank
shall be promoted to fill a vacancy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the vacancy may be filled not by promotion but “by transfer of present
employees in the government service, by reinstatement, by re-employment of
persons separated through reduction in force, or by appointment of persons with
the civil service eligibility appropriate to the position.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
What the Civil Service Act provides in its Sec. 19(3) is that if a vacancy is
filled by promotion, the person holding that position next-in-rank thereto
“shall be <u>considered</u> for promotion.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The said provision reads in full as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">Section 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Recruitment and Selection of
Employees</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) When a vacancy
occurs in a position in the second level of the Career Service as defined in
Section 7, the employees in the government service who occupy the next lower
positions in the occupational group under which the vacant position is
classified, and in other functionally related occupational groups and <span style="">who are competent, qualified and with the
appropriate civil service eligibility <u>shall be considered for promotion</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Interpreting the next-in-rank rule, we said in Santiago v. Civil
Service Commission:<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>One who is next in rank is entitled to preferential consideration
for promotion to the higher vacancy but it does not necessarily follow that he
and no one else can be appointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rule neither grants a vested right to the holder nor imposes a ministerial duty
on the appointing authority to promote such person to the next higher position.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And, indeed, as we noted in the recent case of Abila v. Civil
Service Commission,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the Commission itself, in implementing the said law, provides in its Resolution
No. 89-779 as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">B. Rules on Protest Cases</p>

<blockquote>x x x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>x xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Rule III.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Procedure in Filling Vacancies</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Positions in
the Second Level</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- When a vacancy
occurs in the second level of the career service as herein defined, the employees
in the department who occupy the<span style=""> next
lower positions in the occupational group under which the vacant position is
classified, and in other functionally related occupational groups, who are
competent and qualified and with appropriate civil service eligibility <u>shall
be considered for appointment to the vacancy</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is presumed that, conformably to the above injunctions, Mayor
Labo dutifully considered the private respondent for promotion to the position
of City Engineer of Baguio City although ultimately decided in favor of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There being no showing that
the appointing authority has gravely abused his discretion, even this Court
must respect his decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that, as in the many other earlier cases, the Commission
has again overstepped its authority, encroached upon the discretion of the
appointing authority, and officiously directed the appointment of its own
choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we must again reverse its
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lapinid declared that “henceforth, departure from the mandate of
Luego by the <span style="">Civil </span>Service
Commission after the date of the promulgation of this decision shall be
considered contempt of this Court and shall be dealt with severely, in view
especially of the status of the contemner.” No sanctions are imposed at this
time as the case at <span style="">bar </span>arose
before the promulgation of Lapinid.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The permanent appointment of Teodoro G.
Barrozo as City Engineer of Baguio City is declared VALID.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Resolution No. 90-247 dated March 5, 1990,
and Resolution No<span style="">. </span>90-462, dated
May 23, 1990, of the respondent Civil Service Commission are hereby SET ASIDE,
without any pronouncement as to costs.</p>
