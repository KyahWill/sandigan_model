<p class="BODY">For resolution are petitioners' and public respondents' respective 
Motions for Partial Reconsideration of this Court's Decision of <st1:date month="10" day="8" year="1985">October 8, 1985</st1:date>, which decreed 
that:</p>
<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, while Search Warrant No. 80-84 issued on August 6, 1984 
by respondent Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Ernari</span> Cruz <span class="SpellE">Paño</span> is hereby annulled and set aside, and the Temporary 
Restraining Order enjoining respondents <span class="GramE">from</span> 
introducing evidence obtained pursuant to the Search Warrant in the Subversive 
Documents Case hereby made permanent, the <span class="SpellE">personalties</span> 
seized may be retained by the Constabulary Security Group for possible 
introduction as evidence in Criminal Case No. SMC-1-1, pending before Special 
Military Commission No. 1, without prejudice to petitioner Mila Aguilar-<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> objecting to their relevance and asking said 
Commission to return to her any and all irrelevant documents and articles." 
<span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 154; 139 SCRA 
165).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In their Motion for Partial Reconsideration public respondents 
maintain that the subject Search Warrant meets the standards for validity and 
that it should be considered in <span>the context </span>of the criminal offense 
of Rebellion for which the Warrant was issued, the documents to establish which 
are less susceptible of particularization since the offense does not involve an 
isolated act or transaction.</p>
<p class="BODY">In their own Motion for Partial Reconsideration, petitioners 
assail that portion of the Decision holding that, in so far as petitioner Mila 
Aguilar-<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> is concerned, the<span> </span>search 
made in her premises was incident to her arrest and could be made without a 
search warrant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners submit that a <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span> search can be justified only if it is an 
incident to a lawful arrest and that since Mila Aguilar was not lawfully 
arrested a search without warrant could not be made.</p>
<p class="BODY">On April 10, 1986, we required the parties to MOVE in the premises 
considering the supervening events, including the change of administration that 
have transpired, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 18 of Rule 3 in so 
far as the public respondents are concerned (which requires the successor 
official to state whether or not he maintains the action and position taken by 
his predecessor-in-office).</p>
<p class="BODY">In their Compliance, petitioners maintain that the arrest of 
petitioners and the search of their premises thereafter are both illegal and 
that the <span class="SpellE">personalties</span> seized should be ordered 
returned to their owners.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, on behalf o<span>f</span> public 
respondents, "in deference to the dissenting <span>opinion </span>of then 
Supreme Court Justice (now Chief Justice) Claudio <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>," now offer no further objection to a declaration 
that the subject search is illegal and to the return of the seized items to the 
petitioners.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondents state, however, that they cannot 
<span>agree to <span class="GramE">having</span> the arrest of petitioners 
declared illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The pertinent portion of the dissenting opinion referred 
</span><span>to </span><span>reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The 
questioned search warrant has correctly been declared null and void in the 
Court's decision as a general warrant issued in gross violation of the 
constitutional mandate that 'the right of the people to be secure in their 
persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures 
of whatever nature and for any purpose shall not be violated' (Bill of Rights, 
sec. 3).<span>&nbsp; </span>The Bill of Rights orders the absolute exclusion of all 
illegally obtained evidence:<span>&nbsp; </span>'Any evidence obtained <span>in 
</span>violation of this ... section shall be inadmissible for any purpose in 
any proceeding' (Sec. 4[2]).<span>&nbsp; </span>This constitutional mandate expressly 
adopting the exclusionary rule has proved by historical experience to be the 
only practical means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against 
unreasonable searches and seizures by <em>outlawing</em> all evidence illegally 
seized and thereby removing the incentive on the part of state and police 
officers to disregard such basic rights.<span>&nbsp; </span>What the plain language 
of the Constitution mandates is beyond <span>the power of the courts </span>to 
change or modify.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"All the articles thus seized fall under the exclusionary rule 
<em>totally</em> and <em>unqualifiedly</em> and cannot be used against any of 
the three petitioners, as held <span>by </span>the majority in the recent case 
of <span class="SpellE"><em>Galman</em></span><em> vs. Pamaran</em> (G.R. Nos. 
71208-09, August 30, 1985).<span>&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, considering the respective positions now taken 
by the parties, petitioners' Motion for Partial Reconsideration of this Court's 
Decision of <st1:date month="10" day="8" year="1985">October 8, 1985</st1:date> 
is GRANTED, and the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion thereof is 
hereby revised to read as follows:</p>

Restraining Order enjoining respondents from introducing evidence obtained 
pursuant to the Search Warrant in the Subversive Documents Case hereby made 
permanent.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">personalties</span> seized by 
virtue of the illegal Search Warrant are hereby ordered returned to 
petitioners.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" align="center"><em>CONCURRING </em></p>
<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><strong>TEEHANKEE, <i>C.J.</i></strong>:</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">I felicitate my colleagues for granting petitioners' 
motion for reconsideration and now totally applying the exclusionary rule by 
declaring that the search and seizure of the <span class="SpellE">personalties</span> at petitioner Mila Aguilar <span class="SpellE">Roque's</span> dwelling at <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Street, 
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City was illegal and could not be deemed as 
incident to her arrest earlier on board a public vehicle on the road away from 
and outside of her dwelling.<span>&nbsp; </span>Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Sedfrey</span> A. Ordonez' stand in support hereof signifies one 
more great step in fulfillment of the pledge of the present government of 
granting full recognition and restoration of the civil and political liberties 
of the people and rejecting the oppressive and repressive measures of the past 
authoritarian regime.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The original majority decision citing sec. 12, Rule 
126 of the Rules of Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> had held 
that said Rule states "a general rule that, as an incident of an arrest, the 
place or premises where the arrest was made can also be searched without a 
search warrant.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this latter case, 'the extent and 
reasonableness of the search must be decided on its own facts and circumstances, 
and it has been stated that, in the application of general rules, there is some 
confusion in the decisions as to what constitutes the extent of the place or 
premises which may be searched.' 'What must be considered is the balancing of 
the individual's right to privacy and the public's interest in the prevention of 
crime and the apprehension of criminals.'"</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">This pronouncement had the support of a majority of 
nine (9) Justices of the Court at the time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three (3) members had 
dissented,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> while two (2) other members 
took no part or reserved their vote.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">As the petitioners stressed in their motion for 
reconsideration, "(I)f the majority opinion becomes settled law, the 
constitutional protection would become meaningless.<span>&nbsp; </span>The military 
or police would no longer apply for search warrants.<span>&nbsp; </span>All that they 
would do is procure a search (sic)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
warrant or better still, a PDA, for the person whose house they would want to 
search.<span>&nbsp; </span>Armed with a warrant of arrest or a PDA, the military or 
police would simply wait for the person to reach his house, then arrest 
him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even <span>if </span>the person arrested does not resist and 
has in fact been taken away already from his house, under the majority ruling, 
the arresting party would still have the right to search the house of the 
arrestee and cart away all his things and use them as evidence against him in 
court.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">"In such a situation, what then happens to that 
stringent constitutional requirement that 'no search warrant …. shall issue 
except upon probable cause to be determined by the judge, or such other 
responsible officers as may be authorized by law, after examination under oath 
or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and 
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the things to be seized' 
and the constitutional injunction that 'any evidence obtained in violation of 
this .... shall be inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding.'"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The better and established rule is a strict 
application of the exception provided in Rule 126, sec. 12 and that is to 
absolutely limit a <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span> search of a person who 
is lawfully arrested to his or her person at the time of and incident to his or 
her arrest and to "dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of 
the commission of the offense." Such <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span> 
search obviously cannot be made in a place other than the place of arrest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">Applying the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> 
rule to this case, the undisputed fact is that petitioner Mila Aguilar <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> was arrested at <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30 
a.m.</st1:time> aboard a public vehicle on the road (at <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> and P. <span class="SpellE">Margal</span> Sts.).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The pronouncement by the majority at that time, that as an incident to 
her arrest, her dwelling at <st1:street><st1:address>239-B <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> could be searched 
even without a warrant for evidence of the charges of rebellion filed against 
her was contrary to the constitutional proscription, as defined by law and 
jurisprudence.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was tantamount to sanctioning an untenable 
violation, if not nullification, of the basic constitutional right and guarantee 
against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">With the Court now unanimously upholding the 
exclusionary rule,<em> in toto</em>, the constitutional mandate is given full 
force and effect.<span>&nbsp; </span>This constitutional mandate expressly adopting 
the exclusionary rule has proved by historical experience to be the practical 
means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against unreasonable searches 
and seizures by <em>outlawing</em> all evidence illegally seized and thereby 
removing the incentive on the part of the military and police officers to 
disregard such basic rights.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is of special public importance 
and serves as a shield in the remote provinces and rural areas to the people who 
have no access to courts for prompt and immediate relief from violations of 
their constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">In this case, the arresting CSG group of the 
military themselves knew that they needed a search warrant but they obtained the 
void general warrant in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, the seizure of 
documents and personal effects with such a void warrant could not be justified 
"as an incident of an arrest" outside petitioner's dwelling and the Constitution 
bars their admissibility as evidence and ordains their return to 
petitioners.</p><br><br>
