trial court also issued a notice of levy upon personal property of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Reinsurance moved to set aside the notice of levy and
the notice of garnishment upon the ground that its liability under the decision
was only for P30,000.00, plus interest at 10% per annum from 30 November 1964
until the amount was paid; and that this amount, which with accumulated
interest had reached P84,980.00 as of 8 September 1980, had already been paid
to Factors on that date.</p>

Judge Fidel Purisima, denied petitioner's motion, ruling that the decision, to
enforce which a Writ of Execution had been issued in 21 August 1980, which
decision ordered petitioner Reinsurance and the spouses Gozun to pay back,
jointly and severally, respondent Tiongco "whatever amount is paid by the
latter to [Factors] in accordance with the judgment of this case" -- had
become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the RCBC
issued a manager's check in the amount of P280,367.02 <span style="">to </span>respondent Tiongco and debited Reinsurance's account for the

of Execution and the proceedings resulting in garnishment, and to compel
respondent Tiongco to return to petitioner the amount of P280,367.02.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contended that its liability under
the amended decision of the lower court was only for P84,980.00 -- the amount
of the promissory note which it had secured, plus interest and costs of suit;
and that it could not be made to assume the obligation of respondent Tiongco to
Factors under the financing and servicing agreement, which with accrued
interest and other charges <span style="">as </span>of
9 March 1981 had reached the amount of P280,367.02, since it (Reinsurance) was
not a party thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">By <span style="">a </span>Decision

of Appeals, speaking through Mendoza, V. <u><span style="">J</span></u><span style="">., </span>denied the petition, holding that
it had, in C. A. - G.R. No. 47991-R, earlier affirmed the modified judgment of
the lower court <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>, which judgment had already rejected
petitioner's contention:</p>

<blockquote>Nor can [petitioner] elect to pay Factors the lesser amount in

only ‘in default of Tiongco.’ If Tiongco <span style="">does

<blockquote>In the second place, the contention that to make [petitioner] liable
for ‘whatever amount is paid by (Tiongco) to (Factors)’ as the judgment directs
would be to make [petitioner] liable under <span style="">the financing and servicing agreement to which [petitioner] is not a
party is not correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true that
there </span><span style="">is a </span><span style="">difference in the amount which Tiongco is
required to pay to Factors and that which [petitioner] is required to pay to
the same party, that <span style="">is, </span>P36,269.99
in the case of Tiongco and P30,000.00, in the case of [petitioner].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difference is due to the fact that Tiongco's
obligation to Factors under the financing and servicing agreement includes not
only the discounting of the note at the rate of 29.75% <u>per month</u> but
also the payment of a collection fee of 1% per month and a penalty of 3.5% per
month on all outstanding amounts in the event the note is not paid within 72
hours from the date of its maturity on October 17, 1964.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that Gozun and [petitioner] are not parties to the
financing and servicing agreement, it is equally true that were it not for the
failure of Gozun to pay the note upon its maturity, Tiongco would not have been
liable for the discount rate, the collection fee, and the penalty to
Factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As very well pointed out by
Tiongco, the difference represents damages suffered by Tiongco as a result of
Gozun's and [petitioner's] failure to pay the amount of the note on time."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

pursuant to the Surety Bond it had issued in favor of respondent Tiongco.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental difficulty with Reinsurance's position is, of

that the Reyes’ decision had no ambiguity or inadvertent omission in its
dispositive portion which may, notwithstanding the finality of that decision,
legitimately be clarified by referring to the body of the Reyes' decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispositive portion of the Reyes'
decision had two parts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part I and Part
II.</p>

<p class="BODY">Part I dealt with the claims of Factors asserted against
respondent Tiongco and against the Gozun spouses and petitioner Reinsurance in
the following manner -</p>

<p class="NUM" style="">(a) Claims of<span style=""> </span>Factors against respondent Tiongco:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(1) <u>Ordering

P36,269.99, under the terms and conditions of the financing and servicing
agreement, and the collection fee of 1% and penalty of 3.5% per month on the
accounts receivable as of November 30, 1964; <u>or, in default of said
defendant</u> --"<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Claims of Factors against the Gozun spouses
and petitioner Reinsurance:</p>

<blockquote>“(2) <u>Ordering
defendant spouses Joaquin V. Gozun, Jr., and Maria Nieves Toledo-Gozun and
defendant Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc.,</u> to pay plaintiff,
jointly and severally, the sum of P34,866.96, plus interest thereon at 10% per
annum from November 30, 1964, until complete payment is
made;"(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Part II dealt with (a) the cross-claim asserted by respondent
Tiongco against the Gozun spouses and petitioner Reinsurance, as well as (b)
the cross-claim asserted by Reinsurance against the Gozun spouses in the
following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>On the cross-claim, ordering</u> cross-defendants Joaquin
V. Gozun, Jr., and <u>Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc., to pay back</u>,
jointly and severally, <u>the cross-claimant Tiongco whatever </u><u><span style="">amount is paid by the latter to plaintiff in

of the Orient, Inc., pay[s] the claim of plaintiff, ordering cross-defendants
Joaquin V. Gozun, Jr., and Maria Nieves Toledo-Gozun <u>to pay cross-claimant
Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc., whatever amount or amounts the latter would
pay under its surety bond, RICO Bond No. 105/63, to plaintiff, plus interest
thereon at the rate of 12% per annum,</u> computed from the date of such
payment to the date when reimbursement is fully effected by cross-defendants;
to pay cross-claimant an additional sum equivalent to 10% of whatever amount or
amounts cross-claimant would pay to plaintiff, by way of attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon failure of
cross-defendant(s) to fully reimburse to cross-claimant whatever amount or
amounts might have been paid under its surety bond, the usual decree of
foreclosure shall issue for the sale at public auction of the two parcels of
land described in the agreement of <span style="">counter-indemnity
with mortgage and/or pledge (Exhibit "3-RICO"), and for the disposition
of </span></span><span style="">the </span><span style="">proceeds thereon in

<blockquote>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that in Part II of the dispositive portion,
Judge Reyes ordered the Gozun <span style="">spouses </span>and
petitioner Reinsurance "to pay back jointly and severally, the
cross-claimant Tiongco <u>whatever amount is paid by the latter to plaintiff
[Factors] in accordance with the judgment in </u><u><span style="">this case,</span></u><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>x x x".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complying with Paragraph (1) of Part I of the
dispositive portion of the Reyes’ decision, respondent Tiongco paid Factors the
amount of P221,329.19, and it is <span style="">this
amount (with interest computed up to 26 February 1981) which Reinsurance was
compelled to pay to respondent Tiongco and which Reinsurance now seeks to
recover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was, in other words,
literal compliance with the wording of Part II of the dispositive portion of
the Reyes' decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Viewed in the light most favorable to it, Reinsurance in effect
urges that there is contradiction between Part I dealing with claims of Factors
and Part II dealing with cross-claims of Tiongco and Reinsurance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, in itself, no contradiction is
apparent in the dispositive portion of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part II of the decision ordered the Gozun
spouses and Reinsurance to reimburse Tiongco whatever Tiongco paid under the
judgment; and Tiongco paid under Part I Paragraph (1) as he was ordered to do
by the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not mean to suggest that there was no error in Part II of
the dispositive portion of the Reyes' decision; indeed it is quite clear to the
Court that Part II <span style="">was </span>vitiated
by error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that <span style="">error </span>became irremediable when the
Reyes' decision became final.</p>

<p class="BODY">That error, most succinctly described, lies in the failure of the
trial court and of the Court of Appeals to take account of the provisions of
Article 2209 of the Civil Code which provides <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 2209.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in
delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the contrary,
shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of
stipulation, the legal interest, which is six per cent per annum."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both the <span style="">Gozun </span>spouses
and Reinsurance were liable under the terms and conditions of the promissory
note which stipulated payment of the principal amount of P30,000.00 plus
interest at the rate of 10% per annum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By operation of Article 2209, quoted above, in relation to the
promissory note, the measure of damages to which the Gozun spouses and
Reinsurance could have appropriately been held to for <u><span style="">mora</span></u><span style="">, </span>was <u><span style="">not</span></u>
whatever respondent Tiongco had been compelled to pay to Factors under the
financing and servicing agreement, as Judge Reyes had decreed in his
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appropriate measure of
damages was, rather, simply the payment of an <u><span style="">additional</span></u><span style=""> </span>10%
per annum of interest; that is, the Gozuns should have been held liable <u><span style="">only</span></u><span style=""> </span>for 10% interest for the use of the money (from date of
execution to date of payment) or "monetary interest", plus 10% interest
as damages for delay in payment (from date of demand to date of payment) or
"compensatory interest"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There would have been no inequity in
requiring respondent Tiongco to bear by himself alone the balance of his
liability under his financing and servicing agreement with Factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only Tiongco was party to that agreement and
he alone benefitted by it:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
immediately realized the present value of the P30,000.00 stipulated in the
promissory note instead of having to wait for maturity of the note.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the above mentioned notwithstanding, petitioner Reinsurance
is bound by the terms of the Reyes' decision which constitutes the law of the
case, having been rendered by <span style="">a </span>court with undisputed jurisdiction <u>ratione</u>
<u>materiae</u> and jurisdiction <u>ratione</u> <u>personae</u>, even though
that decision was, <span style="">as a </span>matter of law, incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, there is also some inequity implicit in the result
reached here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Gozun spouses and
Reinsurance paid twice:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>once to Factors
(the amount of P84,980); and again to respondent Tiongco (the amount of
P280,367.02).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as Mendoza, V. <u>J</u>.
in C.A.-G.R. No. SP-12108 said, they have themselves principally to blame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allowed the Reyes' decision to become
final; they also paid Factors directly before respondent Tiongco was in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They overpaid Factors; they overpaid Tiongco
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Gozuns and Reinsurance had <span style="">a </span>right of recourse against both
Factors and against Tiongco, but at least as against Tiongco, that right of
recourse has been lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">The harshness of the result here must be balanced against the
fundamental nature of the public policy involved and to which we must give
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All litigations must at last
come to an end, however unjust the result of error may appear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, litigation would become even more
intolerable than the wrong and injustice it is designed to correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the litigiousness of our people
and the volume of litigation being processed in our judicial system, the
importance of that public policy cannot be overstressed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>For all the foregoing</b>, the Petition for Review is hereby
DENIED and the result (but not necessarily the reasoning) of the Decision of
