<p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with preliminary 
injunction and Prohibition assails the Decision dated September 24, 1981 and the 
Writ of Execution dated February 18, 1982 issued by respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Artemon</span> D. Luna, Presiding Judge of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, Branch XXXII in Civil Case No. 122209 entitled "<span class="SpellE"><em>Doroteo</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Espiritu</em></span><em> versus Romeo M. Hechanova and 
Paramount Insurance Corporation</em>."</p>
<p class="BODY">Hereunder are the background proceedings:</p>
<p class="BODY">On March 8, 1979 herein private respondent Dr. <span class="SpellE">Doroteo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> filed a complaint 
for damages against petitioner Paramount Insurance Corporation, as surety and 
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> as principal, in the Court of First 
Instance of Manila, docketed as Civil Case No. 122209, and assigned to the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of respondent Judge, alleging, among other things that 
"in accordance with his undertaking under the Construction Agreement, <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> posted in favor of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, on October 20, 1978, a Performance Bond issued by 
Paramount Insurance Corporation through <span class="SpellE">Speedbond</span> 
Insurance Center, denominated as PSIC Bond No. 0169."</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="5" day="15" year="1979">May 15, 
1979</st1:date>, petitioner Paramount Insurance Corporation through Atty. 
Reynaldo A. Pineda filed its Answer with Cross-claim and attaching thereto a 
copy of the Indemnity Agreement entered into by it and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="16" year="1980">January 16, 
1980</st1:date>, respondent Judge, upon motion of the plaintiff declared <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> in default for failure to file his answer.</p>
<p class="BODY">On July 25, 1980, counsel for Paramount Insurance Corporation 
failed to appear despite due notice and so plaintiff was allowed to present his 
evidence <em>ex-parte</em> without prejudice, however, to cross-examination set 
on September 18, 1980 and October 1, 1980, both at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="BODY">On September 18, 1980, counsel for Paramount Insurance Corporation 
again failed to appear notwithstanding due <span>notice, </span>and therefore 
the respondent Judge issued an order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> and 
resetting the scheduled hearing on that day as well as that on October 1, 1980 
to November 5 and 14, 1980 at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1980">November 5, 
1980</st1:date>, counsel for Paramount Insurance Corporation did not appear for 
the third time despite notice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the respondent Judge 
cancelled and re-set the trial to <st1:date month="11" day="14" year="1980">November 14, 1980</st1:date> as previously scheduled.</p>
<p class="BODY">On November 14, 1980 plaintiff Dr. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> was allowed to continue with the direct examination 
of the same witness <em>ex-parte</em>, without prejudice to cross-examination by 
Paramount Insurance Corporation set for January 14, 1981 at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="BODY">On January 14, 1981, in view of the unjustified absence of both 
the Paramount Insurance Corporation and counsel, the respondent Judge issued an 
order declaring the cross-examination of plaintiff's witness as waived and 
giving plaintiff ten (10) days within which to make a formal offer of evidence 
and the defendant was given a like period of time to submit comments and/or 
objections thereto.</p>
<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1981, plaintiff filed a "Motion to Admit Formal 
Offer of Evidence" together with the "Formal Offer of Evidence", copies of which 
were furnished to the defendant Paramount Insurance Corporation itself at 
Paramount Building, 434 <span class="SpellE">Quintin</span> <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> St., Manila, and were actually received by said 
defendant as shown by its rubber stamp on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>As there <span>was 
</span>no objection on the part of the defendant, the respondent Judge ordered 
the admission in evidence of plaintiff's exhibits and set the reception of 
defendant's evidence on <st1:date month="4" day="3" year="1981">April 3, 
1981</st1:date> at <st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30 a.m.</st1:time></p>
<p class="BODY">On April 3, 1981, defendant and counsel were absent for trial and 
so, the scheduled hearing was cancelled and re-set to June 17, 1981 which was 
likewise cancelled and postponed to July 1, 1981 with a warning issued by the 
respondent Judge that if counsel and defendant persisted in being absent, the 
Court would be constrained to consider the case submitted for decision.</p>
<p class="BODY">Finally, on <st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1981">July 1, 
1981</st1:date>, due to the <span class="GramE">Unexplained</span> absence of 
defendant and counsel, the respondent Judge issued an order submitting the case 
for decision.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1981">September 24, 
1981</st1:date>, the respondent Judge rendered his decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff 
and against the defendants Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> and 
Paramount Insurance Corporation, ordering the said defendants, jointly and 
severally, to pay plaintiff:</blockquote>
<ol><li>P22,796.00 as actual and compensatory damages;<br><br></li><li>P5,000.00 as exemplary damages;<br><br></li><li>P5,000.00 as attorney's fees; and<br><br></li><li><span><span><span ;="" roman="" new="" times=""></span></span></span><!--[endif]--> To pay the costs</li></ol>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">No appeal having been taken from the above decision, it became 
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, hence, plaintiff filed a motion 
for execution on November 14, 1981 which was set for hearing on November 18, 
1981 at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p class="BODY">Before respondent Judge could act on plaintiff's motion for 
execution, a fire broke out on <st1:date month="11" day="19" year="1981">November 19, 1981</st1:date> and gutted the entire fourth floor of 
the <st1:place><st1:placetype>City Hall</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> wherein some branches of the 
Court of First Instance of Manila including Branch <span>XXXII were 
housed.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>Most unfortunately, not a single record of Civil 
Case No. 122209 was saved.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, a motion for reconstitution was 
filed by the plaintiff on <st1:date month="1" day="7" year="1981">January 7, 
1981</st1:date>, docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-82-1624.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="18" year="1982">February 18, 
1982</st1:date>, the respondent Judge issued an order granting plaintiff's 
motion for reconstitution as well as his motion for execution.</p>
<p class="BODY">Then on <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1982">July 29, 
1982</st1:date>, the petitioner Paramount Insurance Corporation filed a petition 
for relief from the decision of <st1:date month="9" day="24" year="1981">September 24, 1981</st1:date>, in the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, docketed as Civil Case No. 82-11372 and assigned to Branch II 
thereof.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petition however was not given due course and 
therefore was dismissed, for not being sufficient in form and substance, 
<span>in </span>the order of the presiding Judge of Branch II dated <st1:date month="8" day="3" year="1982">August 3, 1982</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was denied, hence, on <st1:date month="8" day="16" year="1982">August 16, 1982</st1:date>, petitioner filed 
before this Court the instant petition for <i>certiorari </i>with preliminary 
injunction and prohibition.</p>
<p class="BODY">The question is thus poised:<span>&nbsp; </span>whether or not the 
present action which seeks to invalidate the decision and the writ of execution 
issued by respondent Judge <span>in </span>Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">122209,</span> is the proper remedy considering that the decision 
here sought to be voided has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">For this procedural problem, the solution lies in the 
determination of the validity of the assailed decision, for against a void 
judgment, petitioner's recourse would be proper. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Macabingkil</em></span><em> vs. People's Homesite and Housing 
Corporation</em> 72 SCRA 326).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that the court in Civil Case No. 122209 
did not acquire jurisdiction over its person because it was not duly served with 
summons.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the decision rendered by it is allegedly 
null and void.</p>
<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction over the <span>pe</span>rson of the defendant in 
civil cases is acquired either by his voluntary appearance in court and his 
submission to its authority or<span> </span>by service of summons.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The purpose of summons <span>is </span>to give notice to the defendant or 
respondent that an action has been commenced against it.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
defendant or respondent is thus put on guard as to the demands of the plaintiff 
or petitioner.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case <span>at bar, </span>the record indicates beyond doubt 
that petitioner was adequately given in the case below the necessary 
notice.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was validly served with summons together with a copy of 
the complaint.<span>&nbsp; </span>It filed its answer to the complaint through <span class="GramE">counsel</span> Atty. Reynaldo Pineda and even invoked the 
jurisdiction of the court for affirmative relief against its co-defendant, Romeo 
<span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such filing of answer with 
<span class="SpellE">crossclaim</span> against Romeo <span class="SpellE">Hechanova</span> is equivalent to voluntary appearance and cured 
the defect if any, of the summons, (Sec. 23, Rule 15, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner's now belated assertion that Atty. Reynaldo Pineda was 
not authorized to appear for and in its behalf is untenable, for the following 
reasons:</p>
<blockquote>a) The mere filing of the answer with <span class="SpellE">crossclaim</span> raised a presumption of authority to appear for 
petitioner Paramount Insurance Corporation in favor of Atty. Reynaldo Pineda, in 
accordance with Section 21, Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such 
presumption is <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>, but only by clear and 
positive proof for obvious reasons.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such clear 
and positive proof thereof, the presumption of authority in favor of Atty. 
Reynaldo Pineda should prevail over the petitioner's self-serving denial of such 
authority.</blockquote>
<blockquote>b)<span>&nbsp;</span>The authority of Atty. Reynaldo Pineda to appear for 
petitioner was disclosed by no less than Atty. Pineda himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>His 
legal services, according to him, were engaged by petitioner Paramount Insurance 
Corporation through its agent, the <span class="SpellE">Speedbond</span> Insurance 
Center.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Annex '5', Answer) It is the same agent who issued 
Performance Bond No. 0169, subject matter of Civil Case No. 12209.</blockquote>
<blockquote>c)<span>&nbsp;</span>Another circumstance that strongly militates against 
petitioner's assertion that Atty. Pineda was not authorized to appear in Civil 
Case No. 122209, is the well-prepared answer with <span class="SpellE">crossclaim</span> filed by said counsel.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consisting 
of eleven (11) pages, the answer is replete with material and relevant details 
and supported by a document, the Performance Bond.<span>&nbsp; </span>An explanation 
is conspicuously absent as to how and why these vital details and document came 
to the knowledge and possession of Atty. Pineda.<span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the 
eleven-page document contains nothing prejudicial to the rights and interest of 
petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Significantly, it alleges numerous defenses against 
the complaint, one of which is the alleged <span class="SpellE">novation</span> of 
the contract which has been adopted by petitioner in its present 
petition.d)<span>&nbsp; </span>Interestingly, the "Motion to Admit Formal Offer of 
Evidence" together with the "Formal Offer of Evidence" reveals that petitioner, 
contrary to its pretense is fully aware of Civil Case No. 122209, as shown by 
the rubber stamp mark bearing its name showing that it actually received copies 
thereof on <st1:date month="1" day="30" year="1981">January 30, 
1981</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite this knowledge, petitioner did not take 
steps to repudiate the representation taken in its behalf by Atty. Pineda. 
<p class="2Q">"Insolvency proceedings were instituted against Tan <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> and her children and grandchildren.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tan 
<span class="SpellE">Lua</span> was at the time, and had been for a year, in 
<st1:place><st1:city>Amoy</st1:city>, 
<st1:country-region>China</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chua 
<span class="SpellE">Chito</span>, her eldest son, who was in 
<st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, employed Attorney Gregorio 
Perfecto to represent him, his mother and her various descendants in the 
insolvency proceedings.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Tan Lua appeared to have full 
knowledge thereof, but did not take steps to repudiate the representation taken 
in her behalf by Atty. Perfecto</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tan <span class="SpellE"><span>Lua</span></span><span> </span>and <span>her 
</span>correspondents were declared insolvent debtors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tan <span class="SpellE">Lua</span> subsequently instituted action for relief from the 
effects of the judgment, on the proceedings and that the attorney who 
represented her was not authorized by her to appear in her behalf.</p>
<p class="2Q">The Court overruled plaintiff's contention, holding that under the 
facts as above-stated, she was represented in the insolvency proceedings by the 
attorney with proper authority.</p>
<p class="2Q">"If the attorney chosen by her son had no authority to represent her 
in the insolvency proceedings, she should at least have acted with due 
diligence, and by not so acting, she must be taken to have acquiesced in the 
employment of the attorney.<span>&nbsp; </span>By so doing she must also be said to 
have ratified the act.<span>&nbsp; </span>It must be remembered that authority to 
employ an attorney does not have to be proved by a public document, nor even by 
<span class="GramE">a paper</span> writing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Its existence may be 
inferred from circumstantial evidence, and in law it is even assumed <em>prima 
facie</em> that every attorney who appears in court does so with sufficient 
authority.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course this is not a conclusive presumption, and in 
a timely direct attack upon the judgment a person may undoubtedly establish 
that, in a particular case, the authority did not in fact exist.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>But the security of judicial proceedings requires that the evasions and 
tergiversations of unsuccessful litigants should not be received in such a 
matter with undue favor." (<em>Tan Lua vs. O'Brien</em>, 55 Phil. 53) 
(Underscoring supplied.)"</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing circumstances, it is evident that the trial 
court acquired jurisdiction over the petitioner, then defendant Paramount 
Insurance Corporation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It follows that its judgment, dated 
<st1:date month="9" day="21" year="1981">September 21, 1981</st1:date>, may not 
be corrected, much less annulled in the instant proceeding.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the 
court has jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person, the orders and 
rulings upon all questions pertaining to the cause are orders and rulings within 
its jurisdiction and cannot be corrected by <i>certiorari</i>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Finally, the reopening and remand of the case to the trial court 
will not serve any useful purpose because the petition fails to state a good and 
substantial defense to justify a new trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>Paraphrasing what this 
court stated in <span class="SpellE"><em>Paner</em></span><em> vs. Yatco</em>, 87 
Phil. 271 cited in <span class="SpellE"><em>Arcilla</em></span><em> vs. 
Arcilla</em>, 138 SCRA 560, it would be pointless to re-open this case, "for 
like a mirage it would merely raise false hopes and in the end avail her (him) 
nothing."</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition for <i>certiorari </i>is 
hereby DISMISSED.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against 
petitioner.</span></p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO
