				<H3>PHILIPPINE GEOTHERMAL, INC., PETITIONER,
VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND VICENTE ERNESTO, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a review of the decision of Commissioners Diego P. <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and Geronimo Q. Quadra of the National Labor
Relations Commission, ordering the reinstatement of Vicente Ernesto as
warehouseman of Philippine Geothermal, Inc. with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
equivalent to one year, six months and twenty-six days computed at the hourly
rate at the time of his dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">From that decision, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Cleto</span>
T. <span class="SpellE">Villatuya</span> dissented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He opined that Ernesto's participation in the
theft of the company's property was proven by substantial evidence and,
therefore, the dismissal was justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1978" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1978</st1:date>
a <span class="SpellE">Petrophil</span> tanker driven by Juan Reyes with Marcos <span class="SpellE">Geralde</span> as helper arrived at the company's project site
located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bitin</span>, Bay, Laguna to deliver ten
thousand liters of <span class="SpellE">Petron</span> diesel oil which were
purchased by the company from <span class="SpellE">Petrophil</span> for P11<span class="GramE">,737</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Warehouseman Vicente Ernesto acknowledged the receipt of the
shipment by signing the corresponding delivery invoice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The oil was supposed to be unloaded at Well
No. 26 in the project site at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulalo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
tanker, instead of proceeding to <span class="SpellE">Bulalo</span>, went out of
the gate, still loaded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
accompanied by Ernesto who informed the security guard, Roberto Solis, that there
was a <span class="SpellE">misdelivery</span> because what was brought by the
tanker was diesel oil instead of gasoline.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That misrepresentation was entered by Solis in his logbook (pp. 4-5, 41,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the oil was not delivered at the drilling area although
according to the delivery invoice signed by Ernesto it was received by the
company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The oil was diverted and sold
to another person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reyes in his extrajudicial confession revealed that the oil was
sold for P9<span class="GramE">,000</span> in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and that he gave Ernesto P4,500 and <span class="SpellE">Geralde</span> P1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">,000 </span>as their shares in the proceeds
of the sale (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reyes said that Ernesto connived (<span class="SpellE"><u>nakipagsabuatan</u></span>) with him in the diver­sion and sale
of the oil.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fiscal charged Ernesto, Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Geralde</span>
with qualified theft in the Court of First Instance of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after a reinvestigation, <u>wherein
Reyes and Solis did not testify</u>, the fiscal exonerated Ernesto and filed a
motion for the dismissal of the case against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court granted the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The company's appeal from
the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> finding, which was based on the
technicality that Reyes' con</span>fession was not admissible against Ernesto,
was dismissed by the Minister of Justice in his resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, despite that exoneration, Philippine Geothermal,
Inc. dismissed Ernesto and on <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1978</st1:date> filed with the Ministry of Labor an application for clearance
to dismiss him for his involvement in the theft of the oil.</p>

<p class="BODY">About seven months later, or on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1979</st1:date>, Ernesto filed a complaint against the
company for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two cases were tried jointly in the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter ordered the
reinstatement of Ernesto with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC affirmed that decision with some
modification.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC committed a grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in disregarding the
testimonies of Solis, the security guard, and Reyes, the driver, in these two
cases, proving that Ernesto was implicated in the theft of the diesel oil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto did not rebut those testimonies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> exoneration of
Ernesto does not justify his reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's evidence shows that Ernesto committed a fraud or breach of
trust which is a statutory ground for his dismissal (Art. 283[c]), Labor Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">"The conviction of an employee in a criminal case is not
indispensable to warrant his dismissal by his employer." If there is
sufficient evidence to show that the employee has been guilty of a breach of
trust, or that his employer has ample reason to distrust him, the labor
tribunal "cannot justly deny to the employer the authority to dismiss such
an employee".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that a
criminal complaint for theft against an employee was dropped by the fiscal is
not binding and conclusive on the labor tribunal (National Labor Union, Inc.
vs. Standard Vacuum Oil Company, 73 Phil. 279).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>National Labor Union</u> case, <u>supra</u>, the
foreman and the checker of the lubricating oil department of an oil company,
who were involved in the shortage of the oil stock in the company warehouse,
were dismissed although the fiscal had dismissed the charge of theft filed
against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>See similar holding in
National Organization of Laborers and Employees vs. <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>,
95 Phil. 727, 733 and Phil. Education Co., Inc. vs. Union of Phil. Education
Employees and CIR, 107 Phil. 1003.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the National Labor Relations
Commission is reversed and set aside and the dis­missal of Vicente Ernesto as
petitioner's warehouseman is hereby decreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
