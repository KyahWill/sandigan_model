<p class="BODY">The issues boil down to the question of who was at fault.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Court of Appeals had contradictory
findings as to how the accident happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found:</p>

<blockquote>"Conclusively, the Valiant car was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
along the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>
at <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, while
the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus was coming from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> at <span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The driver of the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Supan</span>, admitted that
along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArtbur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>,
a road sign "FULL STOP" was about fifty meters away from the
intersection of <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span>
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> and <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Supan</span> also had
admitted that humps were constructed on the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street> before
reaching the intersection of the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> and the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also along the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> is a sign
"SLOW DOWN" located more than fifty meters from the intersection
where the accident occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Supan</span> admitted that the vehicles running along the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam
  <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> were given
preference to pass before those coming from the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under these circumstances, the obligation and duty to be very
careful and to obey traffic signs and regulations is on the part of driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
incredible is his claim that he was following two tricycles which were able to
cross the intersection of the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span>
  Road</st1:address></st1:street>, driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> could
not presume and assume that it was clear and safe for him to cross the
intersection because the tricycles were able to pass thru.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> should
have made a full stop several meters away from the intersection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, it is impossible that the tricycles were
a few meters ahead of him before he could be at the center of the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam
  <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes that driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> did not stop at anytime but continued to run until
the bus has bumped the right side of the body of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the story of <span class="SpellE">Supan</span>
that the policeman made a "stop" sign only when the bus was at the
middle of the intersection is incredible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What actually happened is while the car was cruising along the right
lane of the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> <span class="GramE">Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE">,</span>
the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus continued to run along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street> and bumped
the right side of the body of the Valiant car.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is clearly established by the picture<span class="GramE">,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit</span> 'D'-Juan <span class="SpellE">Dacasin</span>,
and the only damage to the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus is its front
bumper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Valiant car has no damage on
its right fender, indicating that the point of impact (which was bumped by the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus) is at the right side of the body of the
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Exhibit 'D' negates and belies
the claim of driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> that the car bumped his
bus." <span class="GramE">(pp. 32-33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, observed:</p>

<blockquote>"After a painstaking examina­tion of the record, this Court
believes that the defendants?appellants are correct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In reaching this conclusion, we took into account not only the
physical evidence of the damage to the car as relied upon by the lower court
but also the testimony of Patrolman Jimenez who was an eyewitness as the
traffic policeman on duty at that time and whose testimony was shown to be
unbiased, clear-cut and therefore reliable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As can be noted, the lower court upon examining Exhibit 'D',
a picture of the damaged car, showing an indentation on its right side facing
the bus, precipitately concluded that the bus rammed the car by going into the
intersection despite the fact that the car had the right of way as indicated by
a stop sign in its way some six meters before reaching the intersection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lower court failed to appreciate the
evidence gathered from Patrolman Jimenez's <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
testimony that as there was no traffic along <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> which had the right
of way, he <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> the drivers of two tricycles
along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
to cross the intersection (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 17-18, <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1980</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> bus
was directly behind the two tricycles, the bus naturally followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This signal by a traffic policeman to proceed
sufficiently negates the assumption of neglect on the part of the bus driver in
proceeding despite the stop sign.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Patrolman Jimenez also testified, as reinforced by his
sketch, of the relative positions of the two vehicles at the point of impact (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. G) <span class="GramE">that</span> the bus was nearing
the centerline of the intersection when he saw the car along the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam
  <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> going at a
fast clip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since its headlights were on
despite the clear day, he thought that it was on an emergency run and he opted
to signal the bus to stop instead, which did stop, and he expected the car to
pass on the eastern lane of the highway since there was no other traffic at the
time (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 19-28, <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1988</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The evidence showed that while the bus was running slowly as
shown by the fact that the two tricycles which if closely followed at the
intersection were able to cross the same without incident and that it was able
to stop immediately when <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> to do <span style="">so, </span>the car was <span class="SpellE">unrefutedly</span>
going at a fast clip with its headlights on despite the presence of the bus
near the centerline of the intersection and causing it to swerve and hit the
traffic policeman, controller and one bystander when it ran into the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances, there is no doubt
as to who was at fault for the resulting injuries to the victims and the damage
to the car." <span class="GramE">(pp. 21-22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While, ordinarily, the factual findings of the appellate court
are binding on the Supreme Court, the exception to this rule is when it
conflicts with the findings of the trial court (Reynolds Phil. Corp. vs. Court
of Appeals, 169 SCRA 220).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful perusal of the testimony of Patrolman Rodrigo
Jimenez, the traffic cop on duty at the intersection of <st1:street><st1:address>Nam
  <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street> and the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>, whose
credibility both the trial court and the Court of Appeals relied upon, we are
impelled to reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the
trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the bus did not stop when the policeman <span class="SpellE">signalled</span> it to stop, being in a hurry to cross Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Highway as the tricycles had done, it rammed into the
side of the car causing the side of the car to cave in.</p>

<p class="BODY">A photograph speaks more than a thousand words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The picture of the damaged
car (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> D) <span class="GramE">shows</span>
that it was hit in the middle of the body by a huge moving object such as a
bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The theory that the side of the car
caved in because it sideswiped the bus is absurd because it is impossible for
any motor vehicle to travel sideways.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Motor vehicles travel forward or backward, never sideways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the car sideswiped the front of the bus,
as the Court of Appeals theorized, its right side would have been scratched,
from front to rear, but it would not have been deeply dented inward in
midsection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that, as testified
by Patrolman Jimenez, the car was thrown or pushed toward the shoulder of Nam <span class="SpellE">Kwang</span> Highway hitting him where he stood, conclusively
proves that the car was hit by the bus, not vice-versa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bus hit the car, which had the right of way, because the bus
driver, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Supan</span>,
did not obey the "STOP" sign posted on the side of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>, sixteen
meters from the intersection, nor the policeman's signal to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
Court believes that driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> did not stop at any
time but continued to run until the bus has bumped the right side of the body
of the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the story of <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> that the policeman made a 'stop' sign only when the
bus was at the middle of the intersection is incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What actually happened is while the car was
cruising along the right lane of the <st1:street><st1:address>Nam <span class="SpellE">Kuang</span> <span class="GramE">Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span class="GramE">,</span> the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus continued to run
along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">MacArthur</span> Highway</st1:address></st1:street>
and bumped the right side of the body of the Valiant car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is clearly established by the picture,
Exhibit 'D'-Juan <span class="SpellE">Dacasin</span>, and the only damage to the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus is its front bumper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Valiant car has no damage on its right
fender, indicating that the point of impact (which was bumped by the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus) is at the right side of the body of the
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Exhibit 'D' negates and belies
the claim of driver <span class="SpellE">Supan</span> that the car bumped his
bus." <span class="GramE">(pp. 32-33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The bus driver failed to observe Sections 42(d) and 43(c) of the

<p class="BODY">Since the damages suffered by the petitioners were caused by the
reckless negligence of the bus driver, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Supan</span>, his employer, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span>
Bus Company, is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with him for the
said damages (Art. 2180, Civil Code), it having been established, as the trial
court adverted to, “that the <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus management
did not exercise due diligence to avoid accident, there being no rules and
regulations issued to its employees governing their conduct and discipline, and
it is very clear that the management failed to exercise the proper supervision
