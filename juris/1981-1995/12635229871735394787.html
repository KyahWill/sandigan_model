This is a mandatory review of the decision in three separate cases 
jointly tried by the then Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur, 
sentencing Dalmacio Maalihan y Cantos, Alfredo Piano y Pilapil and 
Alfredo Sabaybay to three (3) death penalties each for the murder of 
Luis Arejola (Criminal Case No. 6320), Roman Mora (Criminal Case No. 
6425), and Narciso Buendia (Criminal Case No. 6426).
<p>
Another accused, Rufino Marasigan, died during the trial and, on motion 
of the prosecution, the charges against him were dismissed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Alfredo Maalihan who was at large, was not included in the informations.
</p><p>
The following are the facts disclosed by the records.
</p><p>
At about 6:30 in the morning of September 25, 1958, Luis Arejola went to
 Bo. Cadian, Pili, Camarines Sur, to personally supervise the harvesting
 of his land, the ownership of which was being disputed by the Pili 
Agricultural School and one Maximo Palma.  Because of the rumor that the
 tenants therein, Alfredo Sabaybay, the Longas and the Marasigans, would
 not deliver his share as owner, Arejola thought it wise to personally 
supervise the harvesting of said land to enable him to get his share in 
the produce.
</p><p>
On his way to Cadian, Arejola passed by the house of one Roman Mora in 
Carunuyan, San Jose, Pili, Camarines Sur, to ask the latter to accompany
 him to the said land.
</p><p>
In the afternoon of the same day, the lifeless bodies of Luis Arejola, 
Roman Mora and a certain Narciso Buendia were found in sitio Caboclodan,
 San Jose, Pili, all victims of multiple gunshot wounds.  The autopsy 
performed by Dr. Theo J. Santy, Municipal Health Officer of Pili, showed
 that the victims died of acute internal hemorrhage, secondary to 
multiple gunshot wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
</p><p>
Investigation of the shooting incident was immediately undertaken by 
elements of the Philippine Constabulary.  Valeriano Longa, reportedly 
the last person contacted by Arejola, was questioned.  Longa pointed to 
Victorio Canabe as the person who could furnish information as to the 
identity of the male­factors.  Canabe was investigated and in a sworn 
statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  given by him 
during the investigation, he stated that four (4) days before the 
incident under inquiry, or in the afternoon of September 21, 1958, he 
and Alfredo Sabaybay met in Naga City and in that meeting the latter 
informed him that in a few days three men would be coming to his 
(Canabe's) house, as they in fact came to his house in the morning of 
September 25.  They asked him to notify Alfredo Sabaybay of their 
arrival, which he did.  Upon returning to his house, Canabe prepared 
lunch for the three men in accordance with the ins­tructions given by 
Sabaybay.  After lunch, when the three men took off their shirts, he saw
 that each had a gun tucked in his waist.  After the arrival of Sabaybay
 that afternoon, the latter and the three men left the house.
</p><p>
At the trial, Canabe identified Dalmacio Maalihan and Alfredo Piano as 
two of the three men who went to his house on September 25.
</p><p>
The PC officers also investigated Alfredo Sabaybay.  He gave a sworn statement,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
  admitting his meeting with the three men in Canabe's house.  He 
further stated that from Canabe's resi­dence he and the three men 
proceeded to the vicinity of the house of Valeriano Longa, where they 
saw Luis Arejola.  Sabaybay identified Luis Arejola to his three 
companions by pointing to him, in accordance with the instructions given
 to him by Rufino Marasi­gan when they met in Naga City on September 21.
  In that meeting, Marasigan informed Sabaybay of the plan to kill 
Arejola.
</p><p>
With the description of the killers given by Canabe and Sabaybay, the PC
 officers arrested Dalmacio Maalihan.  In the ensuing investigation 
Maalihan executed an affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  acknowledging his parti­cipation in the killings and naming Alberto 
Maalihan and Alfredo Piano as his companions.  Alfredo Piano was 
likewise apprehended and following said arrest, he too gave a sworn 
statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
It appears from their affidavits that after Sabaybay had pointed out 
Luis Arejola to them, they, Dalmacio Maalihan, Alfredo Maalihan and 
Alfredo Piano trailed Arejola, Mora and Buendia up to sitio Caboclodan. 
 When Arejola looked back, they simul­taneously fired at the victims 
until they ran out of ammunition.  This portion of their extrajudicial 
confessions was later enacted at the place of the crime by Dalmacio 
Maalihan and Alfredo Piano under the direction of Maalihan himself.
</p><p>
Thereafter, three separate informations for murder were filed against 
Dalmacio Maalihan, Alfredo Piano, Rufino Marasigan and Alfredo Sabaybay.
  As heretofore stated, Rufino Marasigan died during the trial.
</p><p>
After trial, the lower court rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "THEREFORE, in Criminal Case No. 6320, the court finds the three 
accused, Dalmacio Maalihan y Cantos, Alfredo Piano y Pilapil and Alfredo
 Sabaybay guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, for the
 brutal killing of the late Luis Arejola, with the attendance of five 
aggravating circumstances, namely:  Premeditation, Treachery, committed 
in an uninhabited place or by a band whenever such circumstance may 
facilitate the commission of the crime, committed by persons to insure 
or afford impunity, and the crime was committed in consideration of a 
prize, reward or promise, and hereby sentences each of them to suffer 
the maximum penalty of DEATH and to indemnify, jointly and severally, 
the heirs of the deceased LUIS AREJOLA in the sum of P15,000.00 
Philippine Currency and to pay the cost, proportionately. </p>
  <p>
    In Criminal Case No. 6425, the court finds the three accused, 
Dalmacio Maalihan y Cantos, Alfredo Piano y Pilapil and Alfredo 
Sabaybay, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER, for the
 senseless and remorseless killing of ROMAN MORA, with the attendance of
 four aggravating circumstances, namely:  Treachery, committed in an 
uninhabited place or by a band whenever such circumstance may facilitate
 the commission of the crime, committed by persons to insure or afford 
impunity, and the crime was committed in obvious consideration of a 
prize, reward or promise, and hereby sentences them, each to suffer the 
maximum penalty of DEATH and to indemnify, jointly and severally the 
heirs of the deceased Roman Mora in the sum of P12,000.00 Philippine 
Currency and to pay the cost, proportionately.
  </p>
  <p> In Criminal Case No. 6426, the court finds the three accused, 
Dalmacio Maalihan y Cantos, Alfredo Piano y Pilapil and Alfredo 
Sabaybay, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, for the
 senseless and remorseless killing of NARCISO BUENDIA, with the 
attendance of four aggravating circumstances, namely:  Treachery, 
committed in an uninhabited place or by a band whenever such 
circumstance may facilitate the commission of the crime, committed by 
persons to insure or afford impunity, and the crime was committed in 
obvious consideration of a prize, reward or promise, and hereby 
sentences them, each to suffer the maximum penalty of DEATH and to 
indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the late Narciso Buendia 
in the sum of P12,000.00 and to pay the cost, proportionately."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellants now seek to set aside the judgment on the ground that their 
confessions had been obtained through promise of immunity, apart from 
the use of force, threat and intimidation.  They further impute error on
 the lower court for having peremptorily brushed aside their defense of 
alibi.
</p><p>
We find no reasonable ground to disturb the judgment of conviction.  In 
impugning their extrajudicial confessions, Sabaybay, Maalihan and Piano 
testified to alleged third degree treatment from the P.C. investigators.
  Sabaybay declared that in the early morning of October 5, 1958, 
elements of the Philippine Constabulary, namely:  Mota, Saldo, Turiano 
and Mayores came to his house and told him that the Captain wanted to 
question him on some matters.  He was led to a PC jeep, and blindfolded.
  Then they brought him to a house near the river.  He said that 
although blindfolded, he could recognize the house where he was brought 
by leaning on the wall and tapping the same.  In that house he was 
stripped naked.  Then PC Cpl. Saldo stabbed him with the edge of his 
hand on the side of the neck and on the lower nape near the mandible.  
He was repeatedly boxed on different parts of the body until he lost 
consciousness.  After he was revived by the water poured on him, he was 
maltreated anew.  He finally signed the statement, Exhibit H, because he
 could no longer put up with the torture.
</p><p>
To corroborate the alibi, his wife Isabelita Buendia testified that she 
brought Alfredo to a "parahilot" for treatment of his dislocated ribs.
</p><p>
Upon the other hand, Dalmacio Maalihan declared that he was taken by PC 
officers to a river where he was undressed; that he was made to lie down
 and water was poured inside his nostrils, causing him to urinate; and 
that he was submerged in the water until he lost consciousness.  He too 
signed the statement, Exhibit K, to avoid further maltreatment.
</p><p>
For his part, Alfredo Piano alleged that he was made to sit on a chair 
at the PC headquarters and forced to stare at a big electric light bulb;
 that he was kicked on the stomach, until he lost consciousness; that 
upon regaining consciousness, his head was pushed inside a toilet bowl 
filled with human excreta; and that his testicles were repeatedly 
pounded.  Thus, he signed the statement, Exhibit L.
</p><p>
Gruesome and condemnable indeed are the details narrated by the 
appellants of the alleged torture they had undergone.  Considered alone,
 they evince an appearance of truth and sincerity, but taken vis-a-vis 
with the other circumstances revealed by the records, We find them 
totally bereft of the faith and credence that the accused earnestly seek
 to elicit from Us.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  We have carefully scrutinized the appellants' confessions and 
the diverse details contained therein could have been known only by the 
very persons who had taken part in the execution of the acts in 
question.  Thus, the meeting held on September 21, 1958 before the 
Peñafrancia Fiesta, the persons then present, the matters taken up 
therein, including the plan to kill Luis Arejola, as well as the routes 
taken by Sabaybay when he guided the three killers to the victim, are 
details which could not have been concocted by the PC investigators. </p>
  <p>
    2.  The recitals in said extrajudicial statements are in many 
respects confirmatory and corroborative of each other.  In his 
affidavit, Sabaybay not only related his meeting with the three men in 
the house of Canabe on September 25, 1958, he also admitted that, upon 
being assured by them that they had been sent by Marasigan, he guided 
them to the place where Luis Arejola was at that time, for 
identification of the latter.  He also named Piano and Maalihan as two 
of the three gun wielders whom he accompanied to the field.
  </p>
  <p>
    The foregoing statements interlock with the admissions of accused 
Maalihan and Piano in their respective affidavits, Exhibits K and L, to 
the effect that it was Alfredo Sabaybay who acted as their guide and 
pointed out to them the intended victim, Luis Arejola.  Likewise, in 
said confessions appear the statements of Maalihan and Piano that the 
shooting commenced simultaneously at the precise moment Luis Arejola 
looked back, and that it ended only when they ran out of ammunition.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  Not one of the appellants had himself examined medically.  
Neither had they requested for such medical examination.  As aptly 
observed by the Solicitor General -
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Appellants failed to show any injury indicative of the 
maltreatment allegedly suffered by them.  If, as appellant Alfredo 
Sabaybay claimed that he was struck, boxed at the stomach at the left 
mandible, and his mouth bled rendering him unconscious, it is strange - 
and he himself admits this - that after he was discharged from the 
custody, he did not submit himself to any doctor for examination or 
treatment.  (pp. 138, tsn, April 3, 1963) This fact belies such claim of
 maltreatment.  While appellant claimed having gone instead to an 
"herbolario" who gave him a general body massage (p. 86, tsn., October 
30, 1962) the latter was not produced to corroborate such assertion. </p>
    <p> "Appellant Alfredo Piano likewise admitted that he did not 
submit to any doctor for physical examination (p. 85, tsn., February 8, 
1967).  Nor does the evidence for appellant Dalmacio Maalihan show that 
he ever sought medication by reason of his having been manhandled."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    4.  Each of the affiants in his extrajudicial confession tried to 
minimize his own participation in the offense by throwing the blame upon
 his co-accused.
  </p>
  <p> Thus, the declaration of Alfredo Sabaybay in Exhibit "I" that he 
tried to dissuade the three men from executing the plan to kill Arejola,
 but that they did not mind him, coupled with this exculpatory statement
 in Exhibit "H" that he went home after he had pointed out Arejola to 
them and was, therefore, not present during the actual shooting, 
strongly indi­cate that he executed his extrajudicial confession of his 
own free accord.  The same inference applies to the futile attempt of 
appellants Maalihan and Piano to throw the responsibility to a certain 
Jose Umali whom they attempted to picture as the mastermind.  As this 
Court said in People v. Mejares,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 "those parts of the confession which would avoid or lessen the 
declarant's criminal liability could have come only from the mouth of 
one who stood to benefit from the qualifications or avoidance of the 
admission."
  </p>
  <p>
    5.  Piano and Maalihan willingly submitted to a reenactment of the 
crime.  Sgt. Porfirio Turiano testified that it was done under the 
direction of the appellants Maalihan himself.  In addition, the 
execution of such reenactment dovetailed with the description given 
thereof by said appellants in their respective confessions.
  </p>
  <p> 6.  As to the claim of Sabaybay that his extra­judicial statement 
was obtained through promise of immunity, the record is bereft of any 
showing that the PC investigators, ever promised immunity to him.  And 
even assuming that the investigators did make such proposal, the promise
 of immunity by one who is not a prosecuting officer and therefore not 
in a position to comply with such promise, cannot be interposed as an 
objection to the admissibility of the confession. </p>
  <p>
    7. The testimonies of several prosecution witnesses strongly belie 
the claim of force and intimidation.  The regularity of the proceedings 
leading to the execution and verification of the affidavits in question 
was attested to by Provincial Fiscal Alfredo Reyes, Deputy Clerk of 
Court Justiniano Ezequiel and Judge Nicolas Papica, all of whom declared
 that the appellants fully understood the contents of their respective 
statements, at the time they swore to the truth thereof.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In fine, We view appellants' claim of torture and duress too dubious to 
merit credence.  Thus, the alibi of appellants cannot but be a mere 
afterthought foisted to avoid the damaging effects of their 
extrajudicial confessions.  Easy to concoct, their alibi cannot prevail 
over the positive identification of the accused by witnesses.  In the 
case at bar, Dalmacio Maalihan and Alfredo Piano were pointed to by 
Victorio Canabe as among the three men who came to his house on 
September 25, 1958.  Their co-accused Alfredo Sabaybay likewise 
identified them as two of the hit men who, after he had indicated to 
them the victim, tracked down their prey.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
From the evidence on record, We are satisfied that appellants Maalihan 
and Piano are guilty of the crime of triple murder, qualified by 
treachery.  They gunned down Luis Arejola, Roman Mora and Narciso 
Buendia in a sudden volley of gunfire trained at their back, making it 
impossible for the victims to defend themselves from the aggression.
</p><p>
However, We find the evidence too inadequate to establish that the crime
 was committed in consideration of prize, reward or promise.  The trial 
court likewise erred in taking into account the aggravating circumstance
 of "uninhabited place." The prosecution failed to prove that the 
accused intentionally sought the solitude of the place where the crime 
was committed in order to better attain their purpose.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  Neither can it be said that the crime was committed by a band.  For 
the circumstance of band to be present, there must be at least four 
armed malefactors.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>   The execution of the crime by three armed malefactors does not constitute a band.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
</p><p>
With respect to Alfredo Sabaybay, We do not find sufficient evidence to 
saddle him with the criminal responsibility of a co-principal.  His 
participation in the crime being limited merely to identifying Luis 
Arejola to the triggermen, We hold him liable as an accomplice, 
conformably to the settled rule that those whose participation in the 
killing was not indispensable to the consummation of the murder are 
liable as accomplices.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, all circumstances considered, the decisions appealed from are
 modified in the sense that appellants Dalmacio Maalihan y Cantos and 
Alfredo Piano y Pilapil are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 in each of the three crimes committed and to indemnify the heirs of the
 deceased Luis Arejola, Roman Mora and Narciso Buendia in the sum of 
P30,000.00 each.
</p><p>
Alfredo Sabaybay is hereby convicted as an accomplice and sentenced to 
an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years, as minimum, to seventeen 
(17) years, as maximum, and to pay solidarily with the above-named 
principals an indemnity of Fifteen Thousand Pesos (P15,000.00) to the 
heirs of Luis Arejola, Roman Mora and Narciso Buendia.
</p><p>
Costs against appellants, proportionately.
SO ORDERED.
