<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are succinctly summarized by <span style="">the Solicitor General in his brief, as

<blockquote>"On June 4, 1986, the Mobile <span style="">Team </span>stationed at <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> received an information from a Confidential
Informant (CI) that there was rampant drug trafficking in the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Gasak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 1 &amp; 2, June

was assigned to act <span style="">as </span>a
poseur-buyer and was given a marked P10.00 bill (Exhibit “A”; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 2 &amp; 3, June 11, 1987; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<span style="">pp. </span>2 &amp; 3, September 7,
1987).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At around 4:15 in the afternoon of the same day, the buy-bust
operation team <span style="">proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Gasak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and positioned themselves where they could actually
see the transaction (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 3 &amp; </span>4, June
11, 1987).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Agent <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> standing about 30 to 50
meters away from the <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span> Church was approached
by the appellant together with his companion and asked if he would like to buy
(‘kung <span class="SpellE">iiskor</span>’, in the local language of the addicts)
and he replied positively ('<span class="SpellE">oo</span>, <span class="SpellE">iiskor</span>

one (1) plastic tea bag containing marijuana in exchange of a marked P10.00
bill (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 4, September 7, 1987).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the arrest <span style="">of <span style="">th</span></span>e appellant and was able to confiscate from h<span style="">im </span>the marked P10.00 bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plastic tea bag containing marijuana
handed by appellant to Agent <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> was taken by the
team from the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant's
companion, however, was able to elude the arrest by running towards a small
pathway (‘<span class="SpellE">eskinita</span>’) where <span style="">only </span>one person can pass through (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,

incident in the blotter (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 4 &amp; 5, <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1987</st1:date>).</blockquote>

and placed the appellant under arrest (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 7, <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1987</st1:date>).</blockquote>

jail warden at the <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span> Police Station who
testified that the jail blotter for June 1986 was destroyed by flood (so that
