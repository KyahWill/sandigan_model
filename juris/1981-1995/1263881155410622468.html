<p class="BODY">The backdrop of this case on record reveals the following
antecedent facts:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 11, 1988, prior to the January 18,
1988 local<span style=""> </span>elections, petitioner
and Bernadette <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Agcorpa</span></span><span style="">, a </span>registered voter of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, filed with the COMELEC a petition for
disqualification against then candidate for mayor <span class="SpellE">Jejomar</span>

of municipal funds to enhance his candidacy and his entire ticket under the <span class="SpellE">Lakas</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bansa</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The disqualification case was assigned to the
Second Division of the COMELEC composed of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Haydee</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>, as presiding officer, and Commissioners
Andres R. Flores and <span class="SpellE">Magdara</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Dimaampao</span>,

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Second Division, through its Presiding
Commissioner, referred the case to the Law Department of respondent commission

 4, 1988</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> filed his

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1988</st1:date>, petitioner filed an Omnibus Motion praying for the
inhibition and/or disqualification of Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>

was the first of several motions for inhibition filed by <span style="">petitioner </span>before respondent

ruling that "no substantial reason exists why this case should be taken <u>en</u>
<u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style="">; </span>and considering finally that the
case is set for hearing <span style="">by </span>the
Second Division."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 26, 1988, petitioner Lozano

1988 local elections based on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code but not
resolved before the elections shall be referred for preliminary investigation
to the Law Department which shall submit its report to the Commission <u>en</u>

resolution, the Second <span style="">Division </span>on
even date referred back the disqualification case against respondent <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> to the Law Department "before taking any action
thereon."</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="11">November

disqualification case be heard and decided <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> invoking
therein COMELEC Resolution No. 2050.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of issuing a formal resolution, respondent COMELEC authorized

herein assailed, the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dismissed the petition for
disqualification and the criminal complaint for vote buying against respondent <span class="SpellE">Binay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the
promulgation of judgment, petitioner asked that the same be suspended until
after the resolution <span style="">of the </span>legal
issues raised involving constitutional and jurisdictional questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>
was likewise requested by petitioner to decide the motion for her
inhibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her undated order subject
of the petition in G.R. No. 94521, as stated <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>limine</u></span>,
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> denied the motion for her
inhibition, stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"During the deliberations on this case, I seriously considered
inhibiting myself from despite participating and voting despite the flimsy
basis which was cited for it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
became convinced, from the information that was coming in, that the motion was
really part of <span style="">a </span>numbers game,
being played out on the basis of information emanating from the Commission

for disqualification for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for reconsideration filed by herein petitioner was denied in
a resolution dated August 15, 1990, on the ground that âpursuant to Section
1(d), Rule 13 of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Rules of Procedure, a
motion for reconsideration of an <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> ruling of the Commission
is one of the prohibited pleadings, and therefore not allowed under the
Rules."</p>

<p class="BODY">Succinctly condensed, the petition filed against respondents
COMELEC and <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> raises the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the requirement under Section 2,
Rule 3 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, SPC NO. 88-040 was referred to the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> without the required unanimous vote of all the
members of the Second Division.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The minute resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1990</st1:date> is null and void for having been
issued without prior notice to the parties and without fixing a date for the
promulgation thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. Respondent
commission committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction <span style="">in </span>not finding <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> guilty of vote-buying, contrary to the evidence
presented by petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 94521, this Court<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>issued
on August 16, 1990 a temporary restraining order<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
ordering respondent Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> to cease and
desist from participating in the deliberation and resolution of the motion for
reconsideration dated August 9, 1990 filed in SPC No. 88-040, entitled
"Oliver O. Lozano, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Jejomar</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Binay</span>." The order was served in the office of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> on <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1990</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="25" hour="11">11:25

It appears, however, that the motion for reconsideration was denied by
respondent commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="8"><span style="">August
 15, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, copy of

</span>Consequently, the issue on the inhibition and disqualification of
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> has been rendered moot and
academic.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the
petition for inhibition of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> has not
been mooted by the resolution <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> dismissing the main case
for disqualification, petitioner's postulation that she should have inhibited
herself from hearing the main <span style="">case, </span>for
allegedly having prejudged the case when she advanced the opinion that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Binay</span> could only be disqualified after
conviction by the regional trial court, is of exiguous validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the COMELEC Rules of
Procedure, specifically Section 1, Rule 4 thereof, prohibits a member from,
among others, sitting in a case in which he has publicly expressed prejudgment
as may be shown by convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no showing that the memorandum wherein Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> rendered her opinion was ever made public either by
publication or dissemination of the same to the public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the opinion of Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> was based on prior cases for disqualification filed
with the COMELEC wherein prior conviction of the respondent <span style="">was </span>considered a condition <u>sine</u>
<u><span style="">qua</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>non</u> for the filing of the
disqualification case.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We accordingly find no compelling reason to inhibit Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span> from participating in the hearing and decision of the
case.<b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly,<span style=""> </span>we find the
petition in G.R. No. 94626 devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner first avers that under Section 2, Rule <span style="">3 </span>of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure, a
case pending in a division may be referred to and decided by the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u> only on a unanimous vote of all the members of the division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is contended that SPC No. 88-040 which was
pending before the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC's</span> Second Division was
referred to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> without the required unanimous
vote of all the division members, petitioner alleging that Commissioner Andres
R. Flores voted for the referral of the petition for disqualification to the
division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, the
submission of petitioner that the resolution of the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1990</st1:date> is

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner's submission that said resolution has been
repealed by the COMELEC Rules of Procedure which took effect on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1988</st1:date>, there is nothing
in the resolution which appears to be inconsistent with the procedural rules
issued by the COMELEC. <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, Resolution No. 2050 was passed by reason of the variance
in opinions of the members of respondent commission on matters of procedure in
dealing with cases of disqualification filed pursuant to Section 68 of the
Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6646, or the
Electoral Reforms Law of 1987, and the manner of disposing of the same had not
been uniform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the COMELEC decided
to lay down a definite policy in the disposition of these disqualification
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this purpose in mind, the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> adopted Resolution No. 2050.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transitory provision under Section 2,
Rule 44 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure provides that these rules shall
govern all cases pending at the time of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
thereof, except to the extent that in the opinion of the commission, or the
court in appropriate cases, an application would not be feasible or would <span style="">work injustice, in which event the former
procedure shall apply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that
Resolution No. 2050 qualifies and should be considered as an exception to the
generally retroactive effect of said rules.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, <span style="">prior to the
issuance of Resolution No. 2050, petitioner had filed several motions with the
Second Division asking for the referral of the disqualification case to the
Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
t</span>he COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> issued Resolution No. 2050, <span style="">petitioner filed another motion for the
referral of the case to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, specifically
invoking Resolution No. 2050.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In the words of petitioner in his said
motion, under the aforesaid resolution, "once the petition for

Department." Petitioner having invoked the jurisdiction of the Commission <u>en</u>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, Resolution No. 2050 specifically mandates a definite
policy and procedure for disqualification cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The COMELEC Rules of Procedure speak of
special actions, which include disqualification cases, in general.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as between a specific and a general
rule, the former shall necessarily prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the propriety of the issuance of the resolution denying
petitioner's motion for reconsideration, suffice it to say that the requirement
of notice in the promulgation of resolutions and decisions of the COMELEC
embodied in Section 5 of Rule 18 of the Rules does not apply in the case at bar
for the simple reason that a motion for reconsideration of an <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u> ruling, resolution, order or
decision is not allowed under Section 1, Rule 13 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we have consistently held that under the 1935 and 1973
Constitutions, and the same is true under the present one, this Court cannot
review the factual findings of the Commission on Elections absent a grave abuse
of discretion and a showing of arbitrariness <span style="">in </span>its decision, order or resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The principal relief sought by petitioner is predicated on
the <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction of this court as provided in Section 11,
Article XII-C, 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is, </span>as explained in <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>
vs. Commission on Elections, 'not as broad as it used to be' under the old
Constitution and it 'should be confined to instances of grave abuse of
discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process.'
Moreover, the legislative construction of the constitutional provision has
narrowed down 'the scope and extent of the inquiry the Court is supposed to
undertake to what is strictly the office of <i>certiorari</i> as distinguished
from review.' And in <span class="SpellE">Lucman</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>,
a case decided under the Constitution of 1935, this Court, speaking through
then Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, ruled that 'this Court
can not x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> review
rulings or findings of fact of the Commission on Elections,' as there is 'no
reason to believe that the framers of our Constitution intended to place the
[said] Commission - created and explicitly made 'independent' by the
Constitution <span style="">itself - </span>on a lower
level' than statutory administrative organs (whose factual findings are not
'disturbed by courts of justice, except when there is absolutely no evidence or
no substantial evidence in support of such findings.').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Factual matters were deemed not proper for
consideration in proceedings brought either 'as an original action for <i>certiorari</i>
or as an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> . . . [for] the main issue in . . . <i>certiorari</i>
is one of jurisdiction - lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion
amounting to excess of jurisdiction' while 'petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>
are limited to the consideration of questions of law.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The aforementioned rule was reiterated in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bashier</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, as early as the year 1938, applying
Section 4, Article VI of the 1935 Constitution, this Court held that the
Electoral Commission's 'exclusive jurisdiction' being clear from the language
of the provision, 'judgment rendered . . . in the exercise of such an
acknowledged power is beyond judicial interference, except 'upon a clear
showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of the power as <span style="">will </span>constitute a denial of due
process of law.' Originally lodged in the legislature, that exclusive function
of being the 'sole judge' of contests 'relating to the election, returns and
qualifications' of members of the legislature was transferred 'in its totality'
to the Electoral Commission by the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That grant of power, to use the language of
the late Justice Jose P. Laurel, 'was intended to be as complete and unimpaired
as if it had remained originally in the legislature .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . '<span style="">&nbsp;
