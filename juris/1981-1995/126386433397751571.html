				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case calls for the retrospective application of a 1988
amendment to the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, more particularly, Section
15, Rule 119, as revised, treating of demurrers to evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Luz Oñas y Capangpangan stands accused of having malversed public
funds in her possession by reason of her official position as Deputy Provincial
and Municipal Treasurer of Montevista, Davao del Norte, under an information
filed with the Sandiganbayan on September 1, 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> After Oñas, with the assistance of
counsel <i>de officio</i>, had entered a plea of innocent on arraignment, the
State presented its evidence and then rested its case.  Thereafter, as narrated by the Sandiganbayan
--<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"On July 1, 1988, when the case was called for the initial
presentation of the defense evidence, the accused (Oñas), personally and
through her counsel (<i>de parte</i>), manifested that she was waiving the
presentation of evidence in her defense and, upon her oral motion, was granted
a period of thirty (30) days to file her demurrer to evidence, which period was
later extended at her instance.  On
September 5, 1988, accused filed her ‘Demurrer to Evidence,’ to which
prosecution filed its 'Opposition' on September 29, 1988."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On that day that, "the Court," as further stated by the
Sandiganbayan,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
"lengthily explained to ** (her) and her counsel the nature and legal
consequences thereof and the accused signified her understanding and express
conformity thereto (Page 122, Record; Pp. 2-4, TSN, July 1, 1988)."</p>

<p class="BODY">Oñas' demurrer cited several grounds justifying outright
dismissal of the charges against her, and contained the <i>reservation</i> that
it was "without prejudice to her right to adduce evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 11, 1988, the Sandiganbayan promulgated its Decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
overruling Oñas' demurrer, declaring her to have lost the right to present
evidence in her behalf in accordance with Section 15, Rule 119 of the 1985
Rules on Criminal Procedure -- rejecting, too, by the way, Oñas’ contention
that the provision was unconstitutional -- finding her guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the felony with which she was charged, and sentencing her -</p>

<blockquote>" ... to suffer the
indeterminate penalty ranging from TWELVE (12) YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and
ELEVEN (11) DAYS of reclusion temporal as the minimum, to EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS,
EIGHT (8) MONTHS AND ONE (1) DAY, likewise of reclusion temporal, as the maximum;
to further suffer perpetual special disqualification; to pay a fine of
P267,327.71 corresponding to the amount malversed; to indemnify the Government
of the Republic of the Philippines in the same amount of P267,327.71, and to
pay the costs of this action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Oñas' motion for reconsideration was denied by Resolution
promulgated November 9, 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">She has seasonably taken an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> to this
Court and prays that her conviction "be reversed and set aside * * (or if
the Court is not so minded, that her) conviction be set aside and the case
remanded to the respondent court and the latter ordered to receive * * (her)
evidence * *." In her petition for review she contends that the
Sandiganbayan erred in (1) convicting her "on the basis of evidence
secured in contravention of the law," and "on the basis of
information and investigation had when there was no duly appointed Tanodbayan
(Ombudsman) lawfully authorized to do so," and (2) in "considering
her to have waived the right to adduce evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan was, to be sure, quite correct in emphasizing
to Oñas on July 1, 1988 that by filing a demurrer to evidence, she was waiving
the right to present evidence.  That
cautionary advice was entirely justified by the governing provision then in
force, Section 15, Rule 119 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure -- a
provision having no counterpart in the 1964 Rules and obviously meant to alter
the jurisprudential principle theretofore obtaining<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> -- said Section 15 reading as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 15.  <i>Demurrer
to Evidence</i>.  -- When after the
prosecution has rested its case, the accused files a motion to dismiss the case
on the ground of insufficiency of evidence, he waives the right to present
evidence and submits the case for judgment on the basis of the evidence for the
prosecution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But the law was changed after Oñas' demurrer to evidence had been
overruled, verdict rendered against her, her motion for reconsideration of her
conviction denied by Resolution promulgated on November 9, 1988, and before she
could take an appeal to this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> On November 13, 1988, the 1988
amendments to the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure (Rules 110-126, Rules of
Court) went into effect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> Section 15, Rule 119, was amended
to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 15.  <i>Demurrer
to evidence</i>.   -- After the
prosecution has rested its case, the Court may dismiss the case on the ground
of insufficiency of evidence:  (1) on
its own initiative after giving the prosecution an opportunity to be heard; or
(2) on motion of the accused filed with prior leave of court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the Court denies the motion for dismissal, the accused may
adduce evidence in his defense.  When
the accused files such motion to dismiss without express leave of court, he
waives the right to present evidence and submits the case for judgment on the
basis of the evidence for the prosecution.   (n)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the time-honored rule to which attention is drawn by
the Solicitor General,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> that adjective statutes may be made
applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their passage,
the amended provision should have been applied to Oñas, specially since it is
favorable to her.  So does this Court
now rule:  Section 15 of Rule 119, as
lastly amended, applies as regards Oñas.  Since she sought and was granted leave to file a demurrer to evidence,
and she made an explicit reservation to present evidence in the event of denial
of her demurrer (withdrawing an earlier waiver made by her), her situation
falls within said Section 15, Rule 119, as amended.  Not having expressly waived the right to adduce evidence, she did
not lose the right to do so after her motion for dismissal was denied.  Hence, the Court is constrained to regard as
grave error, because contrary to the letter and spirit of the applicable law
(albeit probably unintended), the Sandiganbayan's act of ruling otherwise under
the circumstances, and convicting Oñas on the basis only of the evidence of the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worthy of note that by an extended Resolution dated
September 19, 1988 in G.R. No. 78759 entitled <i>Bonalos v. People</i>, the
Third Division of this Court, also on recommendation of the Solicitor General,
similarly gave retroactive effect to said Section 15 of Rule 119, as revised by
the 1988 Amendments, upon the authority of the same precedents above cited.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion here expressed makes unnecessary (and premature)
consideration of the other errors assigned to the Sandiganbayan by the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Sandiganbayan's Decision promulgated on
October 11, 1988 in Criminal Case No. 12417 is REVERSED AND SET ASIDE, and the
case is REMANDED to the Sandiganbayan for reception of the petitioner's
evidence and subsequent appropriate proceedings.  No costs.</p>
