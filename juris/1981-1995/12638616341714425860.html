<p class="BODY">From the judgment of conviction, appeal was lodged with the Court
of Appeals which, in view of the penalty imposed by the trial court, elevated
the record of the case for review to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant interposed a single assignment
of errors <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that there </span>is absent
here that quantum of proof which is sufficient to overcome the constitutional
presumption of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">innocence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">fact</span>s,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>as found by the trial court, may be
summarized in the following manner:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 September 1975, at about 11:00 o'clock in the morning,
complainant Wilhelmina <span class="SpellE">Ramel</span>, then a twenty-three
year old housewife, was alone in their <span class="SpellE"><u>kaingin</u></span>,
while her six-year old son was in a hut about seventy (70) meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she was gathering vegetables, she
became aware of someone approaching her from behind and turning her back, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">saw </span>appellant <span class="SpellE">Rolly</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant immediately embraced her, covering her mouth with his hand
and thereupon forcibly brought her to the ground, sat on her stomach, and
grabbed her neck with both hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
his right hand, he drew his bolo from his waist line and pointed it at her
breast, warning her that if she shouted, he would kill her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After threatening her, the appellant laid
down his bolo and removed the short pants and the panties of the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then unzipped his pants,
brought out his private organ, positioned himself on top of the complainant,
inserted his private organ into the private parts of the complainant and
proceeded to copulate with the complainant until the sexual act was
completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the appellant put
on his pants, took his bolo and threatened the complainant again that should
she report the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">incident to </span>her
husband, he (appellant) would kill her.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the appellant left, complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">put i</span>n her panties and short pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her dress had become muddy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Crying and weeping, she went directly to her
husband, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Ramel</span>, who was then busy plowing his
fields.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She reported to him that
appellant <span class="SpellE">Rolly</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span>
had taken her by force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Initially, the
husband wanted to look for the accused and to confront him but later husband
and wife decided to refer the matter to their <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On that same day, complainant
and her husband went to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mr. </span>Bernardo Asuncion,
but they were unable to see him as he was away at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were told instead to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">return </span>the next day so that the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain could convene a meeting where the dispute
could be resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This they did, but
again, the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain was not at home.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, a meeting or confrontation took place at the home of the
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="9">4 September 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Present during the meeting were the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain and three (3) <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> councilmen, the
complainant, her husband and her parents, the appellant <span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span>,
his wife and parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain was unable to effect any
"settlement" of the matter, in view of the stout denial by the accused
than he had raped the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain prepared a certification<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
which was signed by both complainant and appellant, endorsing the complaint to
higher authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before filing a criminal complaint, complainant and her husband
proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Bambang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, where complainant underwent a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">medical examination </span>at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">According to Dr. Bernardo, the presence
of spermatozoa inside the vaginal canal indicated previous sexual intercourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The day following the physical and medical examination,
complainant and her husband returned to <span class="SpellE">Kasibu</span> and
made a formal report of the incident to the police authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statement of the complainant was taken by
Police Investigator <span class="SpellE">Aniseto</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Absalon</span>
on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9">9 September 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A complaint for rape was then filed with the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Kasibu</span> against appellant <span class="SpellE">Rolly</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After a preliminary investigation had been
conducted, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> filed the information charging appellant with the
crime of rape, in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented a different version of the events of <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="9">2 September 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the trial, appellant <span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span> denied having raped the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified that on the morning of <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="9">2 September 1975</st1:date>, he was in his farm
in <span class="SpellE">Cappit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kasibu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, cleaning the rice
paddies.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
That same morning, according to appellant, complainant Wilhelmina <span class="SpellE">Ramel</span> arrived at his farm and asked him for P3,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant informed her that he had no
money and the complainant then went home.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The appellant further claimed that in 1966 or 1967, while he and complainant
were still single, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">he </span>had paid
court to her and that eventually they became lovers and continued to be lovers
although both of them subsequently married.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Out of this illicit relationship, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">appellant </span><span class="SpellE">Villaflores</span> continued, a
child named "<span class="SpellE">Yoly</span>" was begotten, but the
child fell sick and died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ap<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pellant </span>contended that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">knew </span>the child was his because
complainant had told him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>she
had not permitted her husband to sleep with her during the conception of this
child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant went further,
testifying that aside from the child named "<span class="SpellE">Yoly</span>,"
the complainant had conceived twice by him but had both times undergone
abortions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The complainant used to give him clothes, pants, and a ring, so the appellant
testified, but all the presents were burned by his wife.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the foregoing statements of the appellant
as "unworthy of rational belief." The trial court noted that:</p>

<blockquote>"this (sic) claims are bare assertions unsubstantiated by any
reliable proof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be difficult,
indeed, to find any semblance of truth in the testimony of the accused
deliberately twisted to exculpate himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court could hardly believe that the complainant would ask P3,000.00
from the accused when the latter had no visible means of substantial
support.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the accused declared
that he had a daughter named <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">'<span class="SpellE">Yoly</span>’ </span>with the complainant who died of illness
during infancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned out, however,
that the child '<span class="SpellE">Yoly</span>' who is the daughter of
complainant with her husband is very much alive and is at present studying at
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kasibu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary
  School</st1:placetype></st1:place> (see Exhibit 'F').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the accused has (sic) made untruthful
narration of facts, his entire testimony do (sic) not deserve any credit as it
appears manifestly false."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">We have carefully examined the records of
this case and find no reason to disagree with the above conclusion of fact
reached by the trial court.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
appellant expanded his defense which he had submitted to the lower court and
this time stressed heavily that while he did have sexual intercourse with
complainant on the morning <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="9">2 September 1975</st1:date>, that sexual embrace
was voluntary on the part of complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant argued that complainant could have run away from him and
shouted for help when she saw appellant approaching her had she really wanted
to avoid a sexual encounter with the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He stressed that when he embraced her, she offered no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">resistance </span>which she could have, if
she indeed were an unwilling partner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant underscored the absence of bruises or other tell-tale signs on
the body of the complainant which, appellant argued, indicated willing
submission on her part to his sexual embrace.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court was not persuaded by the story told by the
appellant and neither is this court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the first place, ‘assuming for a moment only that ap<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">p</span>ellant's story was substantially true and that appellant and
complainant had been lovers at sometime in the past, no presumption arises that
the complainant had not in fact been raped, nor that the copulation with which
the appellant was here charged was not coerced but rather consensual on the
part of the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People </span>v. </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Taduyo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>the Court explained:</p>

<blockquote>"There is another reason why we are compelled to reject the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> defense that he and Margarita were common law
husband and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">w</span>ife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One may assume, <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:words">arquendo</u></span> merely, that <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> and Margarita did live together as pretended
husband and wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But that by itself
does not prove that <span class="SpellE">Ro<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">g</span>aciano</span>

under all circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>of a prior history of a common law

<p class="BODY">In this case, as in most rape cases, the trial court's evaluation
of the relative credibility of complainant upon the one hand and the accused
upon the other is critical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed
out earlier, the trial court did not find the accused-appellant a truthful
witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the trial
court<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>was clearly impressed and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">p</span>ersuaded that the complainant was
telli<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">ng</span> the truth when she
testified in effect that the accused had taken her unaware so that she was
unable to shout or to flee when he grabbed her and embraced her suddenly and
clapped his hand over her mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand the guilt of the accused is deemed to have
been persuasively demonstrated where it appears that the declaration of the
complainant was categorical and straight-forward, that no motive was shown for
her fabricating a tale that could lead to so grievous a consequence for a
fellow human being, that the cross examination to which she was subjected, far
from weakening what was testified to by her, strengthened it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
manifestly unbelievable, if not ridiculous, testimony has not dented the solid
and firm testimony of the victim of his bestial assault.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of complainant as to how the offense of rape was
committed was clear, concise, and categorical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she was subjected to a thorough, searching and intensive
cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She stood firm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her story held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not discredited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is, thus, the quantum of proof
necessary for the constitutional presumption of innocence to be overcome."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It seems scarcely necessary to recall the
rule, so firmly settled, that the findings of fact of the trial court which had
the inestimable advantage of listening to and wat<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

entitled to the greatest respect and will not be overturned by an appellate

<p class="BODY">The absence of physical injuries on complainant's body does not,
