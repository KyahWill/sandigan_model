				<H3>WORLD-WIDE INSURANCE & SURETY CO., INC., PETITIONER, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HON. SERAFIN R. CUEVAS, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF MANILA, THE SHERIFF OF MANILA, AND BUENAVENTURA SALDAÑA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Saldaña</span> 
was the owner of a motor vehicle which he had insured with the herein 
petitioner, World-Wide Insurance &amp; Surety Co., Inc.<span>&nbsp; </span>While the 
policy was in force, the driver of the private respondent disappeared with the 
motor vehicle and his whereabouts, as well as that of the motor vehicle, are 
still unknown despite diligent efforts to locate them.</p>
<p class="BODY">As a result, <span class="SpellE">Saldaña</span> filed a complaint 
against the insurance company to recover the proceeds of the policy, but the 
latter refused to pay on the ground that the assured "who is engaged in the 
business of 'service' is <span class="SpellE">subsidiarily</span> liable to the 
defendant for the acts of his employee (driver) and, therefore, whatever the 
defendant may be compelled by the Court to pay the plaintiff can be set off by 
his <span class="GramE">liability</span> to the defendant, and that plaintiff 
failed to take all reasonable steps to safeguard the motor vehicle from loss or 
damage in violation of one of the policy conditions."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">The parties submitted a "Stipulation of Facts and Issues", after 
which, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, "ordering 
defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with 
6% interest thereon per annum from the time of the filing of the complaint until 
<span>the </span>whole <span>am</span>ount shall have been totally paid; 
P3,000.00 as attorney's fees, this being merely an <em>ex-parte</em> 
case;<span>&nbsp; </span>and to pay costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p>
<p class="BODY">The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the decision, 
but the trial court denied the same for lack of merit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, 
the defendant filed a notice of appeal, appeal bond, and record on appeal, 
signifying its intention to appeal to the Court of Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>A 
<span>few </span>days later, the plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the appeal 
on the ground that it was not perfected on time, since the motion for 
reconsideration of the decision filed by the defendant was a <em>pro-forma</em> 
motion and did not interrupt the period for the perfection of appeals.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The trial court found the motion to dismiss well taken and, accordingly, 
dismissed the defendant's appeal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, the defendant filed a 
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, with preliminary 
injunction and/or <span>res</span>training order with the Court of Appeals 
seeking the annulment of the order dismissing its appeal and praying that its 
appeal be given due course.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The appellate court, however, dismissed the petition on the ground 
of lack of jurisdiction since the appealed decision is based upon stipulated 
facts and purely questions of law are involved in the projected appeal.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of this resolution, but 
the same was denied by the appellate court.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the defendant 
filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with this Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime later, counsel for the respondents manifested to this 
Court "that in satisfaction of the judgment, petitioner has paid respondent 
Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Saldaña</span> P20<span class="GramE">,700.00</span> under Filipinas Bank &amp; Trust Co. Check No. 109062 
thru the Sheriff of Manila.”<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p>
