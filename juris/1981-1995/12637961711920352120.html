<p class="BODY">2. The action filed by the plaintiff (private respondent William
Lee) should have been one for Specific Performance instead of <i>Mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3. As to issue on legal redemption, petitioners charge the
appellate court with affirming the conclusion of lower court without legal
basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">4. The Intermediate Appellate Court sweepingly and lopsidedly
quoted with approval the findings of fact of the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Such contentions of
petitioners do not deserve Our consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">The records show that
Exhibit “D” or the assailed decision in Civil Case No. 122927, during the trial
on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 16.0pt">October 21, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. p. 14, </span><st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">October 21, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">) was formally offered and admitted <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as one of the documen</span></span>tary
evidence for the private respondent without being objected to nor <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the New Rules of Court
provide that the Court shall consider no evidence which has not been formally
offered, it is equally true that a Court can consider evidence which has been
presented and formally offered during trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is especially true in a situation where petitioners, although not
defendants in Civil Case No. 129927, are involved as co-heirs or co-owners over
a 322.91 square meter-lot which they (petitioners) and the other co-heirs (who
were made defendants in Civil Case No. 122927) jointly and seve­rally offered
for sale through <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">their </span>authorized
represen­tative and counsel, Atty. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Nuyles</span>, as
well as jointly and severally reaped benefits from the payment made by the
herein private respondent on the mortgage to the bank, the payment of real
estate and inheritance taxes to the government as well as the payment of the
survey fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Petitioners aver that
private respondent's action should be one for Specific Performance instead of <i>Mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such contention was denied by private
respondent alleging that while the two cases are being heard by the trial
court, petitioners had failed to move for dismissal on said ground; in fact
after the issues were joined and a pre-trial was held on July 2, 1981, peti­tioners
in their memorandum filed with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> stated only four
issues without including the issue </span>about <i>Mandamus</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 10 Memorandum for respondents or p. 109, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The nature
of an action is not necessa­rily determined or controlled by its title or
heading but rather, by the body of the pleading or complaint itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid possible denial of substantial
justice due to legal technicalities, pleadings as well as reme­dial laws should
be liberally construed in order that the litigants may have ample opportunity
to prove their respective claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, We find that petitioners are not entitled to legal
redemption under the provisions of Article 1620 of the Civil Code because while
they are the co-owners of that 322.91 square meters lot covered by Trans­fer
Certificate of Title No. 127502, 270 square meters of which had been sold to
private respondent by petitio­ners' other co-heirs and/or co-owners,
petitioners toge­ther with their co-heirs had offered for sale the entire
322.91 square meter-property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
private respondent agreed to purchase the same and advanced a considerable
amount of money in payment of the mortgage due for fore­closure, delinquent
estate and inheritance taxes, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">well
as</span> survey fees and others, the herein petitioners wanted to renege on
their agreement to sell and instead offered to redeem the property from private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be it noted that in their
Motion for Extension of Trial to file Petition for Review dated <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1986</st1:date>, they were even seeking
to be considered as pauper litigants, which is a move inconsistent with their
offer of legal redemption and the necessary expenses therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such posture only reveals their possible
intent to refuse the sale of the remaining 52.91 square meters-portion of the
lot in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, We find nothing wrong with the appellate court in
copying <u>verbatim</u> the stipulation of facts ap­pearing in the decision of
the lower court if the appel­late court finds that the said stipulation
reflects the truthful and complete background facts of the cases at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> premises considered, the petition is hereby DENIED
for lack of merit and the assailed decision is AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
