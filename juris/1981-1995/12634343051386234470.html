on the ground that petitioner is not personally liable for the amount adjudged
since the same constitutes a corporate liability which nevertheless cannot even
bind or be enforced against the corporation because it is not a party in the
collection suit filed before the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The procedural antecedents are not complicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 June 1985, private respondent filed with the Regional Trial
Court (RTC) of Catanduanes a complaint for a sum of money against petitioner.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

The case was docketed as Civil Case No. 1292 and was assigned to Branch 42
thereof.  It is alleged therein:</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.  That from late 1981 up to early 1983, the
defendant, taking advantage of his close friendship with the plaintiff,
succeeded in securing on credit from the plaintiff, various items, cash and
checks which the defendant encashed, in the total amount of P93,358.51, which
the plaintiff willingly extended because of the representations of the
defendant that he was a successful financial consultant of local and
international businessmen;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  4.  That defendant's indebtedness referred to in the next preceding
paragraph, is shown and described in thirty (30) ‘vales’ signed by him or by
persons authorized by him, all of which documents are in the possession of the
plaintiff for being unredeemed or unpaid, xerox copies attached as Annexes
"A" to "Z" and "AA" to "DD" which are
hereby made integral parts hereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  5.  That commencing with the summer months of 1983 up to the time
immediately before the filing of this complaint, the plaintiff had made
numerous demands for payment but the defendant acted in gross and evident bad
faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable
claim;</blockquote>

<blockquote>  6.  That the plaintiff is left without any recourse other than to enforce
his claim in court and had to secure the services of the undersigned counsel
who charged the plaintiff with P1,000.00 for accepting the case, P200.00
appearance fee for every appearance before this Court, and attorney's
contingent fee of 25% of the award in favor of the plaintiff; plaintiff shall
incur litigation expenses which may amount to no less than P5,000.00, all of
which amounts are recoverable from the defendant.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his Answer,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner does not deny having had business transactions with the private
respondent but alleges that the professional relationship began only in August
of 1982 when he “was looking for a '<i>pro-forma</i>' invoice to support his
loan with the Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK for short) under the
Ministry of Human Settlement (sic).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> He

however, the "vales", more specifically Annexes "A" to
"DD" of the complaint, "were liquidated in the bank loan
releases."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

It is thus clear that his main defense is payment; he did not interpose any
other affirmative defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Pre-Trial Brief,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioner reiterated the earlier claim that his first business dealing with
the plaintiff (private respondent herein) was in August of 1982.  This time, however, he alleges that "as
President of CSAR Marine Resources, Inc., he requested for a <i>pro-forma</i>
Invoice for said corporation to support the loan application with the Kilusang
Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran (KKK for short), with the Ministry of Human Settlement
(sic)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">In its Decision of 1 August 1986,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> the
trial court made the following findings of fact:</p>

<blockquote>"Defendant admitted the genuineness (sic) and due execution of
Exhibits "A" to "DD" but, according to him, he already paid
plaintiff P56,908.20 thru PNB Virac Branch, per Cash Voucher dated September
28, 1982 (Exh. 3) and then P42,363.75 also thru PNB Virac Branch, per PNB check
No. 628861K dated December 16, 1982 (Exh. 1)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Analyzing the evidence adduced by both parties, it ruled that
since Exhibit "3" is dated 28 September 1982 and the
"vales", Exhibits "A" to "DD", with the exception
of Exhibits "K" in the amount of P1,730.00 and "Q" in the
amount of P10,765.00, were issued after said date, it could not have been in
payment of the "vales" other than that evidenced by Exhibits
"K" and "Q".  Considering, however, that the "vales" remained in the
possession of the private respondent, they are presumed to remain unpaid; in
fact, private respondent so testified that they were not paid at all.  The court therefore ordered petitioner to
pay private respondent:</p>

<blockquote>"(a) The total
amount of P92,358.43 covered by the ‘vales', plus interest thereon at the rate
of twelve (12%) per cent per annum from June 4, 1985 when the complaint was
filed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  P9,000.00 for and as
attorney's fees; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  The cost of
suit."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed this decision to the public respondent which
docketed the case as C.A.-G.R. CV No. 11389.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent affirmed the trial court's decision in its
Decision of 14 January 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> As
could be gleaned therefrom, petitioner's assigned errors are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x defendant raised as errors of the court <i><u>a</u> <u>quo</u></i>
in (sic) holding that the ‘vales’ (Exhs. A to DD) have not been paid; that the
presumption in favor of the plaintiff-appellee that since he was in possession
of the ‘vales’ the same have not been paid, remained undisputed; that the total
transaction between the parties amounted to more than P200,000.00; and in
rendering a decision in favor of the plaintiff-appellee plus the award of
attorney's fees in his favor."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 5 February 1988, petitioner filed a motion to reconsider the
aforesaid decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
alleging therein, <i>inter alia</i>, that (a) the evidence showing payment of
the "vales" is "uncontroverted", hence the presumption that
they were not paid simply because they remain in the possession of the creditor
cannot arise; (b) the alleged non-payment of the "vales" could have
been further explained if the trial court gave the appellant the opportunity to
present a sur-rebuttal witness and documentary evidence; besides, he has newly
discovered evidence -- invoked in a prayer for a new trial that was
nevertheless denied by the lower court -- which consists of a letter, dated 7
February 1983, signed by Rafael Rodulfo, General Manager of the private
respondent and addressed to Brig. Gen. Clemente Racela, then KKK General Action
Officer, categorically stating that "the account of CSAR Marine Resources,
Inc. c/o Atty. Calvin Arcilla" is only P23,639.33; and (c) the evidence
presented by both parties discloses that "the subject account are (sic)
all in the name of CSAR MARINE RESOURCES, INC., a corporation separate and
distinct from the appellant;" such fact remains 'uncontroverted' as shown
by Exhibits "1", "2", "3", "A" to "DD"
adopted as Exhibits "7" to "25 for the appellant.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

He then prays that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x considering that appellee was not able to prove by
preponderance of evidence the alleged unpaid account of appellant, the decision
promulgated on January 14, 1988 be RECONSIDERED and a new one be entered
REVERSING the lower court decision and thereby ordering the DISMISSAL of
plaintiff-appellee's complaint, with damages and costs against appellee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the remote possibility, that the appellee's complaint cannot be dismissed
outrightly, it is further prayed that this Honorable Tribunal orders (sic) a
new trial for appellant to present additional evidence he wanted to present in
his motion for new trial."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reacting to this motion, private respondent, in a Manifestation
dated 7 February 1988, informed the public respondent that in the interest of
justice and fair play, he interposes no objection to the alternative prayer for
a new trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Hearing was thereafter conducted to receive the petitioner's so-called newly
discovered evidence consisting of the abovementioned letter of Rafael Rodulfo,
dated 7 February 1983, to General Clemente A. Racela (Exh.
"1"-Motion) wherein the former, as General Manager of private
respondent's Universal Enterprises, informed the latter that:</p>

on these grounds:  (a) the veil of
corporate fiction should be pierced in this case; (b) since petitioner did not
raise the issue of separate corporate identity in the pleadings in the trial
court or in his Brief, he cannot raise it for the first time in a Motion for
Clarificatory Judgment; in his answer to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the complaint,
he admits that it was he and not his corporation who transacted business with
the private respondent; and (c) the "vales" refer not only to construction
materials for which the loan to Csar Marine Resources, Inc. was supposed to be
used, but also to consumables such as salt, rice, food seasoning, cigarettes,
coffee, etc.; this indicates that the petitioner himself did not seriously
treat the corporate affairs of Csar Marine Resources, Inc. as separate and

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the Comment, the Reply thereto and the

<p class="BODY">The records bear nothing to prop up the instant petition.  The arguments adduced by the petitioner
breathe no life to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, the pleadings lead Us to the inescapable conclusion
that the petitioner, who is himself a lawyer, is merely taking advantage of the
use of the innocuous phrase "in his capacity as President" found in
the dispositive portion of the challenged Amended Decision -- making the same a
sanctuary for a defense which he, as hereinafter discussed, had long since
abandoned or waived either deliberately or through his obliviscence.  His sole purpose, of course, is to avoid
complying with the liability adjudged against him by the public respondent;
such avoidance is premised on the so-called newly discovered evidence offered
after the public respondent had bent over backwards to grant him a new trial
despite the availability of such evidence during pendency of the proceedings
before the trial court.  It is to be
noted that he failed to assign as error in his Brief the denial by the said
court of his motion for new trial on the basis thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of affirmative relief based on the first assigned error
would really redound to the benefit of an entity which was not made a party in
the main case and which did not seek to intervene therein.  Therefore, it has no personality to seek a
review of the public respondent’s Amended Decision under Rule 45 of the Rules
of Court.  Only the original parties to
the main case may do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, by no stretch of even the most fertile imagination may one be able to
conclude that the challenged Amended Decision directed Csar Marine Resources,
Inc. to pay the amounts adjudged.  By
its clear and unequivocal language, it is the petitioner who was declared
liable therefore and consequently made to pay.  That the latter was ordered to do so as president of the corporation
would not free him from the responsibility of paying the due amount simply
because according to him, he had ceased to be corporate president; such
conclusion stems from the fact that the public respondent, in resolving his
motion for clarificatory judgment, pierced the veil of corporate fiction and
cast aside the contention that both he and the corporation have separate and
distinct personalities.  In short, even
if We are to assume <i>arguendo</i> that the obligation was incurred in the
name of the corporation, the petitioner would still be personally liable
therefor because for all legal intents and purposes, he and the corporation are
one and the same.  Csar Marine
Resources, Inc. is nothing more than his business conduit and alter ego.  The fiction of a separate juridical
personality conferred upon such corporation by law should be disregarded.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Significantly, petitioner does not seriously challenge the public respondent's
application of the doctrine which permits the piercing of the corporate veil
and the disregarding of the fiction of a separate juridical personality; this
is because he knows only too well that from the very beginning, he merely used
the corporation for his personal purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the complaint, petitioner volunteered the
information that the <i>pro-forma</i> invoice which he obtained from the
private respondent and which became the source of the obligations reflected in
the "vales" was to support <u>his</u> <u>loan</u>.  He states in part:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In his motion to reconsider the public
respondent's original decision, petitioner becomes more candid in his
admissions that indeed, the transaction with the private respondent and the
loan obtained previously were for his personal account.  Thus he asserts that:</p>

<blockquote>(a) "The first document <u>made</u> <u>between</u> <u>appellee</u>
<u>and</u> <u>appellant</u> was the pro-forma invoice."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner neglected to set up in his Answer the
defense that he is not personally liable to the private respondent because the
"vales" were corporate obligations of Csar Marine Resources,
Inc..  Of course, that defense would
have been inconsistent with his volunteered admission that the KKK loan ­--
which resulted in the procurement of the <i>pro-forma</i> invoice from the
private respondents -- was for his benefit.  In any case, the failure to set it up as an affirmative defense amounted
to a waiver thereof.  Section 2, Rule 9
of the Rules of Court expressly provides that defenses and objections, other
than the failure to state a cause of action and lack of jurisdiction, not
pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived.  Petitioner, as a lawyer, knows or is
supposed to know this rule.  Since he
prepared the Answer himself, We cannot think of any possible reason why he
failed to set up this defense other than his realization of its inherent
weakness or his outright inexcusable negligence or forgetfulness.  And even if it were due to inadvertence, he
could still have subsequently availed of Section 2, Rule 10 of the Rules of
Court which allows a party to amend his answer as a matter of right within the
period therein stated.  Failing that, he
could have resorted to Section 3 thereof which allows the making of amendments
upon leave of court.  On the other hand,
if the lapse was due to forgetfulness, it is just unfortunate that he did not
exercise due diligence in the conduct of his own affairs.  He can expect no reward for it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then too, as correctly noted by the public respondent,
petitioner, in his Brief, did not assign as error the holding of the trial
court that he is solely liable for the obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners volunteered admission that he procured the <i>pro?forma</i>
invoice from the private respondent in connection with <u>his</u> <u>loan</u>
from the KKK, using his family corporation in the process, and his deliberate
waiver of the aforementioned defense provide an insurmountable obstacle to the
viability of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for utter lack of merit, the instant petition
is DENIED with costs against petitioner.</p>
