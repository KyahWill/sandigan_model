				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On or about March 20, 1981 Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>,
a merchant of some means, and the owner of a pump boat named "Two
Brothers," caused the loading of 56 sacks of rice on the boat at <span class="SpellE"><i>barangay</i></span> <span class="SpellE">Agpangi</span>, Naval, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, and thereafter set sail to sell the rice at some nearby
islands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With him on board were four
crew members, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bembo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
Velasco, and William Sanchez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They sold
the rice at P160.00 per sack at the islands of <span class="SpellE">Maripipi</span>
(<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>), <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
Nino (<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>), and <span class="SpellE">Almagro</span> (<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This done, they sailed back for home, with
only 1 1/2 sacks left of their original cargo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The evening of <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1981</st1:date>
found them near <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Maripipi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place> (<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>).</p>

<p class="BODY">At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7 o'clock</st1:time> that
night, <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was struck on the head twice with a <i>bolo</i>
wielded by <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>,
causing him to drop to the deck, senseless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The boat's anchor and a trailer (push cart) were then tied to <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> body, after which he was thrown overboard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> slowly sank
into the dark waters, never to be seen again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His money, that proceeds from the sale of the rice, was taken from him
before he was cast into the sea.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> crewmen continued on their
voyage back to Naval, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They beached at <span class="SpellE"><i>barangay</i></span>
<span class="SpellE">Aslom</span>, Naval, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11
 o'clock</st1:time> that same night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here they met Alberto Jimenez; and here, too, were brought, on <span class="SpellE">Nulla's</span> instructions, his wife and their three
children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
and his family set sail for <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> were
Sanchez and <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, but not Velasco, who opted to part
with the group at that point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jimenez
followed in another pump boat, but only up to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bigatangan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Island</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and his companions landed the
following day at <span class="SpellE">Bito</span>-on, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From there they proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
on a <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span> bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After two days they boarded an inter-island vessel for <span class="SpellE">Tagum</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
where they stayed for a month, after which they returned to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were arrested shortly upon their arrival at <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> by P.C. soldiers, and brought to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> on the same pump boat belonging to their
deceased employer, the "Two Brothers."</p>

<p class="BODY">Velasco, after leaving his companions at Naval, went, to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
and then to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span>, he
sent a telegram to <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> widow, <st1:city><st1:place>Lourdes</st1:place></st1:city>,
advising of her husband's slaying.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being investigated by PC officers at Naval, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and Sanchez gave written statements, identified at
the trial as Exhibits C, D, and 1, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The statements were signed and sworn to
before Judger Jose <span class="SpellE">Patino</span>, of the Municipal Trial
Court of Naval, after the latter had apprised the trio of their constitutional
rights and translated the contents of their statements to them in the
vernacular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Judge also conducted a
preliminary investigation as regards <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and
Velasco.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing narrative is not subject of dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it conforms substantially to the
appellants' own versions of the occurrences.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It is as regards <i>the manner in which the killing of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>
was done, and the immediately attendant circumstances</i>, that the accused
mainly take issue with the State.</p>

<p class="BODY">In early December, 1981, the Provincial Fiscal filed with the
Regional Trial Court an information charging <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, Jimenez and Velasco with robbery with homicide<span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">,</span> for having killed
Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> and robbed him of P10,000.00,
Philippine Currency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The indictment also
alleged that the crime was aggravated by the following circumstances, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>1. That the act was committed with treachery and evident
premeditation;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2. That the act was committed by outraging or scoffing at the
corpse of the deceased Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. That the crime was committed during nighttime and in an
uninhabited place;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4. That the wrong done in the commission of the crime was
deliberately augmented by causing other wrong not necessary for its commission,
that is, by tying the cadaver of the deceased ** to an iron trailer and anchor
and then dumped (sic) the cadaver into the sea to prevent discovery."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> pleaded guilty on arraignment,
but later took the witness stand in an attempt to establish the justifying
circumstance of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> and Jimenez entered pleas of not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco was never arraigned and is at large
to this day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Separate trials were held
at the instance of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 12, 1984 the Trial Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> promulgated judgment declaring <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> and Jimenez guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the special complex felony of robbery with homicide under
Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
as principal has to pay his debt to society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His plea of guilty is offset by treachery, <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>,
uninhabited place and cruelty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>May the
Lord have mercy on his soul.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is given
the death penalty and ordered to indemnify the heirs of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> the sum of P20,000.00 without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay half the costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the event that he is not executed he is
credited with four-fifths of his preventive imprisonment.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Bembo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> as
accomplice is sentenced to suffer and undergo <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>,
to indemnify the heirs of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> P10,000.00
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay half the
costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is credited with the full term
of his preventive detention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Alberto Jimenez as accessory is sentenced to suffer and undergo
imprisonment of from six (6) years of <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">correccional</span></i> as minimum to ten (10) years of <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> mayor</i> as maximum, to indemnify the
heirs of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> the sum of P2,000.00 without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All three have appealed to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They ascribe several errors to the Court <i>a
quo</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The central issue that they
raise, as might be expected, is one of credibility:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>they contend that their version of the
material occurrences should have been accepted by the Trial Court as reflective
of the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also contend that the
resolution of this basic question –</p>

<p class="BODY">1) their extra-judicial confessions should be disregarded because
taken in violation of their constitutional rights; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) the testimony of the State's "star witness," William
Sanchez, one of the crew of the pump boat, "Two Brothers," should be
disbelieved and discarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants do not disclaim the killing of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> or the taking of his money, from which they
benefited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They assert however that <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was killed by <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> in
legitimate defense of his person; and the taking of his money was merely an
afterthought, having been done so that it would not be "wasted" by
being thrown into the sea together with <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The correctness of the claim for the exclusion of the
extra-judicial confessions of <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> must at the outset be declared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quite apart from the confessants' affirmation
that the confessions were wrung from them by violence and intimidation, an
affirmation that the Trial Court rejected in the light of the testimony of MTC
Judge Patino,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
it is clear from the record that these confessions were made during their
custodial interrogation by the P.C. officers without the assistance of
counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As much is conceded by the
Solicitor General.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Those two (2) confessions must therefore be rejected and disregarded, as this
Court has rejected and disregarded similar confessions in <i>People v. <span class="SpellE">Galit</span></i>, 135 SCRA 465, 472, and other subsequent cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The elimination of the extra-judicial confessions leaves the testimony
of William Sanchez, one of the crew members of the victim's pump boat,
"Two Brothers", as the sole foundation for the verdict of guilt
against the appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Sanchez'
testimony is not to be spurned out of hand merely because it stands alone
against evidence by three other witnesses<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> asseverating the contrary with
respect to the actual killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
axiomatic that witnesses are weighed, not numbered, and the testimony of a
single witness may suffice for conviction if otherwise trustworthy and
reliable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sanchez' testimony negates any notion of self-defense in the
killing of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He describes the slaying as follows:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>At that time, he and <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> were lying
on top (the roof) of the boat's cabin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> came "from
the rear portion of the motor launch (and) went up to the cabin, carrying ** a
bolo" in his right hand, measuring "about eighteen inches including
the handle".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
"went towards the back of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>, **
suddenly raised his bolo and ** hacked Agustin" who was hit in the head
twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>
"fell to the hull" (deck).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> then "ordered Boy Velasco by saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'Boy, you get the money."' Velasco
obeyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He "got the money from the
person of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>" and "gave the
money to <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> next "ordered Bimbo <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> by saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'Bo, you get the trailer and the anchor.'" <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>
did so, bringing over the anchor and the trailer, both "made of iron"
with a combined weight of 65 kilos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trailer and anchor were tied to <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> body by <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> with the
"rope ** attached to the anchor." When this was finished, <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> "ordered <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> Velasco
to slow down the engine because they will drop the dead body." <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> then "threw
the dead body to the sea," which "slowly sank."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, on the other hand, gives a quite
different story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>" ** At past 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon the four of them,
namely, Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>,
Sanchez and he (<span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>) were gathered on top of the
cabin eating supper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were seated in
a circle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>
and Sanchez reached/grabbed for the boiled (<span class="SpellE">tinula</span>)
fresh fish but <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> boxed them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> stood up
and he also stood up and went around but <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>
boxed him twice in his abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
writhed in pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His eyes went blurred
and when they cleared, he saw that <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was about
to pick up his bolo so he beat <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> to it and
immediately hacked the latter once on the forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> fell near
the mast pole while ho remained standing motionless and speechless for quite
some time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco came out of the
cabin, called for Sanchez to take over the steering wheel and asked <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> whether <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was still
breathing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco then ordered <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> to get the rope and bring over the anchor and trailer
(push card) where they tied the body of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then that Velasco thought of getting
the money from the pocket of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> saying that 'I
get this money because if the body of Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>
will fall to the sea the money will be wasted' (TSN, hearing of October 25,
1983, pp. 23).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then they dumped the body
of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> in the sea where it "slowly
sank."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From <span class="SpellE">Nulla's</span> account, which the other
appellants do not at all question, there is some indication that Agustin <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> might not have died from the single <i>bolo</i>
wound inflicted on him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Velasco, for one,
felt impelled to ask if he was "still breathing", as was not at all
improbable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is certain is that not
one of the three appellants, <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> and Velasco, even attempted to minister to the
wounded <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, they were obviously all one in the intention that <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> should die one way or the other, that he should not
survive the bolo wound, and that they should try to prevent discovery of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> body by weighing it down and dumping it into the
sea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, too, it is certain from an
examination of their testimony that they never entertained any thought of
turning over <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> money to his widow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they immediately proceeded
to spend it by sojourning in different places for more than a month, and showed
no compunction whatever in using their employer's pump boat to take them part
way on their journey, although <i>vacation</i> or <i>junket</i> might be the
more appropriate term. </p>

<p class="BODY">Conduct such as this is utterly inconsistent with innocence, or
the justifiable infliction of injury upon another in legitimate self?defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it discloses on appellants'
part a willingness to kill, to appropriate and obtain illicit benefit and
gratification from property belonging to another, and to employ stratagems to
avoid or delay detection of their nefarious acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not furthermore appear to the Court to be credible that <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> would fly into a fit of uncontrollable rage and
start boxing three (3) of his crew men, simply because two of them had
"grabbed" some fish which they were all having for supper anyway.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court cannot therefore accept appellant <span class="SpellE">Nulla's</span>
plea of justifiable self-defense, and sustains the findings of the Court <i>a
quo</i> on the matter as correct, not only because of the time-honored doctrine
that great respect shall be accorded to a trial court's conclusions on the
credibility of witnesses because it is in a better position to observe directly
and at first hand the mien and demeanor of witnesses while giving testimony,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
but also because the veracity of those findings is confirmed by this Court's
own review and assessment of the proofs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, by <span class="SpellE">Nulla's</span> own
testimony, he had foiled <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span> attempt to get
hold of a <i>bolo</i> by getting ahead of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> and
taking it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was thus no need at all
for him to use the <i>bolo</i> on <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span>, as the
Trial Court has pointed out, citing <i>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span></i>,
106 SCRA 381; and as further observed by that Court, there was at the time no
unlawful aggression on the part of the victim and hence, in view of the absence
of this primordial element, there can be no "self-defense, complete or
incomplete."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, a person having no intention to kill anyone, with no
thought in mind except to protect himself from being boxed by another, and who
succeeds in preventing the latter from getting hold of a <i>bolo</i> by himself
taking it -- this being the factual situation described by the appellants --
would surely, not immediately and unhesitatingly use the <i>bolo</i> to strike
a blow at so vital a part of a person's body as the head, absent, as here, any
showing that the victim, on being frustrated in the attempt to get the <i>bolo</i>,
sought to obtain another weapon or otherwise to continue with his assault
against three full-grown, able-bodied men -- an extremely unlikely assumption,
to be sure -- and specially where, as here, those three (3) able-bodied men
could reasonably be expected to subdue their assailant should he persist in
trying to harm them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, after
having wounded and completely disabled an alleged assailant in lawful
self-defense, the first impulse of innocent men would have been to attend to
the injured assailant and give him such medical attention as was available at
the time, not forthwith to weigh down the hapless victim with heavy objects and
without waste of time drop him into the sea, thus effectively eliminating all
possible chance of survival the latter might otherwise have had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the immediate decision of the
appellants to make free with the victim's money and motor launch in order to go
on a trip, either for enjoyment or to escape the consequences of their acts of
the illegality of which they could not but be fully aware, is entirely and
irreconcilably inconsistent with a profession of innocence, and lack of
community of purpose or design.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is thus convinced not only that <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
had failed to discharge the burden reposed on him by the law to prove
self-defense in justification of the killing admitted by him,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
but also that the evidence does establish beyond doubt that <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
attacked <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> without warning, without the latter
having any intimation that such an attack was forthcoming, and without his
having any opportunity whatever to defend himself against the assault; that the
killing was not a senseless, or suddenly provoked act, but was deliberately
planned, the motive being to take the victim's money amounting to what no doubt
seemed to the accused to be quite a tidy sum, the proceeds of sales of rice
which <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> and his companions knew beforehand the
victim would vend in different places and in the sale of which they had in fact
assisted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> killed <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> by reason,
and as part of his plan to rob the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He has thus committed the special complex crime of robbery with
homicide, defined and penalized by paragraph 1, Article 294 of the Revised
Penal Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is also in agreement with the Trial Court that the
crime was attended by the aggravating circumstances of <i>treachery</i>, in
that the attack was sudden and unexpected, done in a manner tending directly
and specially to insure execution of the crime without risk to the offender
arising from the defense which the offended person might make;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> of
<span class="SpellE"><i>nocturnity</i></span>, in that the darkness of evening
was taken advantage of in the commission of the offense and in truth
facilitated it;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
and of <i>uninhabited</i> place, in that the felony was perpetrated in the open
sea, where it no help could be expected by the victim from other persons and
the offenders could easily escape punishment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> There being no adequate proof of
whether or not <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was still alive when he was
thrown into the sea, indeed, the constant reference is to his "dead
body" in the testimony of prosecution witness Sanchez, the aggravating
circumstance of <i>cruelty</i> will not be appreciated against <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cunag's</span> participation in the crime is
also proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without hesitation or protestation of any sort, he immediately lent
assistance and cooperation to <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> after the latter
had rendered the victim <i>hors de combat</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He fetched the anchor and the steel cart or trailer and helped <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> attach this to <span class="SpellE">Mecaral's</span>
unconscious and unresisting person and afterwards throw the unfortunate man
into the deep sea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He willingly took
part in the taking and use of the victim's pump boat, and in the use and
enjoyment of his money; and he accompanied <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> on a
month-long sojourn in various places, no doubt spending the victim's money in
the process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These acts may not suffice
to adjudge him liable as a co-conspirator, or a co-principal, lacking proof of
a prior act or statement evincing his prior knowledge and approval of <span class="SpellE">Nulla's</span> evil intent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They definitely suffice to make him responsible as an accomplice within
the contemplation of Article 18 of the Revised Penal Code, as a person who, not
being a principal as defined in Article 17 of said Code, nonetheless cooperated
in the commission of the offense by simultaneous or contemporaneous acts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the foregoing considerations, the Court pronounces as
without merit the argument that the offenders should be found liable not for
the <i>special complex</i> <i>crime</i> of robbery with homicide but for the <i>separate
felonies</i> of homicide and robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is no question in the Court's mind that the prosecution has
satisfactorily proved that the killing of <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> was
done by reason or on occasion of the taking of his money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, the Court declares as
unmeritorious the contention that William Sanchez, the State's "star
witness" is biased, who succumbed by reason of his youth and illiteracy to
promises of immunity or other benefit in consideration of becoming a
prosecution witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> Nothing in the testimony of either <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> or <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> even remotely
reveals any act on his part in the commission of the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was hence no crime for which he could
be charged, and in relation to which he could be promised immunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And nothing in the record shows him to be
motivated by other than the desire to tell the truth in testifying against his
companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respecting the third appellant, Alberto Jimenez, the Solicitor
General recommends acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence as to him is that when the motor launch of the murdered <span class="SpellE">Mecaral</span> ran aground at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>shore</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sto</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.
Nino, Naval, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>, Jimenez was there with a
flashlight and a bolo; that Jimenez asked <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>,
"Is it through?" and <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> had answered,
"Don't worry, it is already finished"; that this was followed by
another question from Jimenez, "Where is my share?" in response to
which <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> had said, "Don't you worry about
your share, I have it here"; that Jimenez had given <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
and his companions a gallon of gasoline; and that when <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
and his companions sailed away, Jimenez followed in his own motor launch
"up to near <span class="SpellE">Higatangan</span>." Nothing however
can be read into the fact that Jimenez met his co-<span class="SpellE">acused</span>
at the beach, considering that Jimenez' house was only "five or 6 arms
length" (about 15 meters) from the spot where the boat stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And his questions are, as the Solicitor
General argues, susceptible of two interpretations:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>as an inquiry of whether the robbery and
killing had been accomplished, or as inquiring whether the sale of the rice had
been completed and whether his share in the proceeds was forthcoming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, this Court will
absolve Jimenez on reasonable doubt, in application of its earlier rulings,
invoked by the Solicitor General, <span class="SpellE"><i>viz</i></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"If the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts and
circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused of the crime charged and the other
consistent with their guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of
moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is better to acquit a man upon the ground of reasonable
doubt, even though he may, in reality, be guilty than to confine in the
penitentiary a person who may be innocent."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court sentenced appellant <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
to death, appreciating against him the aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>, uninhabited place, and treachery,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a>
offset only by the single mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of
guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It however ultimately reduced
that penalty to <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i> in view of
the abolition of the death penalty by the 1987 Constitution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
This is correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General
opines that even without appreciating any aggravating circumstance against <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>, the result would be the same since the imposable
penalty, on account of the mitigating circumstance of plea of guilt, would be
the minimum of that prescribed, <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>
to death; in other words, <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>just the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the penalty to be imposed on <span class="SpellE">Bembo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, the Solicitor General makes the following
observations and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>"The penalty prescribed ** is <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>
to death</u> **.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 52 of the
Revised Penal Code, <u>the penalty next lower in degree</u> than that
prescribed by law for the consummated felony shall be imposed upon the <u>accomplices</u>
in the commission of a consummated felony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since the penalty next lower in degree to that of <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> to death</u> is <u>reclusion temporal</u> (12
years and 1 day to 20 years), then this penalty should be meted to appellant <span class="SpellE">Bembo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the
minimum penalty shall be that within the range of the penalty next lower to
that prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the offense, that is, <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> (6 years and 1 day to 12
years), and the maximum term of which shall be that which, in view of the
attending circumstances, could be properly imposed under the rules of the
Revised Penal Code (Sec. 1, Act No. 4103 as amended by Act No. 4225, **).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the presence of aggravating circumstances, we
therefore recommend that appellant <span class="SpellE">Bembo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cunag</span> be sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years
and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span><u> mayor</u> as minimum
to 17 years, 4 months and 1 day of <u>reclusion temporal</u> as maximum."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court accepts and approves the recommendation as a correct
application of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment of the Regional Trial
Court is affirmed in so far as appellant <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span> is concerned; as regards <span class="SpellE">Bembo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cunag</span>, it is modified so as to reduce the sentence of
imprisonment to an indeterminate term of from 10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> mayor</i> as minimum, to 17 years, 4
months and 1 day of <i>reclusion temporal</i> as maximum, and affirmed in all
other respects; and with respect to appellant Alberto Jimenez, said judgment is
reversed and Jimenez is acquitted on reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs are charged:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>2/3 against appellants <span class="SpellE">Nulla</span>
