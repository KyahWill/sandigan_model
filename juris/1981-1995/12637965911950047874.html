appointed as 'Sweepstakes Salesman' (Also known as 'Sweepstakes Sales
Supervisor I' and classified as a Fieldman) of complainant Philippine Charity
Sweepstakes (Exhibits A and D), and took his oath of office as such on May 25,

proper application, he was duly bonded in accordance with the provisions of the
Administrative Code to insure his fidelity in the discharge of his duties

<blockquote>The 5-day period above-referred to was,
thereafter, also admittedly extended to 10 days.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During his incumbency, accused Ongkiko had been the recipient
of periodic memoranda detailing his sales performance during each period and
constantly urging him to intensify his campaign efforts to improve his sales
and to expand his sales outlets thru the recruitment of more agents (Exhibits
2, 2-A to 2-F, 3, 3-A to 3-K, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">4, 4-A </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">4-O, 6, 9, 9-A </span>to 9-C).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said accused admits that, by way of improving
his sales performance, he resorted to the practice of turning over tickets to
authorized agents in his sales force on consignment or credit - instead of for
cash as required by the Rules and Regulations above-referred to.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Admittedly, accused Ongkiko received from complainant on
consignment in his capacity as Sales Supervisor the following tickets, to
wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>410 booklets for the May 29, 1967
draw (Exhibits L, L-1 to L-3, M, M-1 to M-3, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

aggregate value of P36,537.99.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these
were duly reported by accused Ongkiko as sold for cash, as evidenced by the
corresponding cash sales invoices issued by him therefor (Exhibits X, X-1 to
X-9, Y, Y-1 to Y-16, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Z, </span>Z-1 to

thereon (Exhibits X-10, X-10-A, X-10-B, Y-17, Y-17-A, Y-17-B, Z-12, Z-12-A and
Z-12-B).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This and the lapse of the
deadline period for accounting and remittance of the proceeds of said sales,
notwithstanding, accused Ongkiko was able to remit only the amount of P4,163.26
thereon, thereby leaving a balance of P26,374.73 outstanding and unpaid
(Exhibits U and W).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cash-examined by
Delfin Silangerus, Senior Auditing Examiner of the General Auditing Office
detailed with complainant, on October 4, 1967, accused Ongkiko’s above-stated
accountability was duly confirmed and, upon demand for the production of all
cash, money and paid vouchers and examination of his safe vault and other cash
receptacles, was found to be short in the amount of P26,374.73 - a fact which
said accused duly certified to be in accord with his records and documents
(Exhibits V, V-1 to V-3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the amount aforesaid was not forthcoming upon the demand aforesaid, nor was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the same duly liquidated thereafter, the
corresponding administrative charge was lodged against accused Ongkiko and, in
due course, per Resolution No. 673 of complainant's Board of Directors, dated
November 27, 1968, he was ordered separated from the service for cause
effective as of July 1, 1967, without prejudice to whatever action complainant
would take for the recovery of the amount involved (Exhibit K)." (Rollo,

transportation expenses for a period of one month from the day after the 5-day

p. 45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner capitalizes on the use of the word <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">liable</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>instead of accountable in the invoices and the term <u>turn</u>
<u>over</u> under the above rule to prove his point that he is only civilly
liable for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>shortages in the
proceeds of the sweepstakes tickets received from the PCSO.</p>

<p class="BODY">The name and contents of the consignment invoices by which the
petitioner received the tickets from the PCSO show that he received said
tickets on a consignment basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consignment in its common meaning is an arrangement whereby the goods
are sent by one to another to be sold and disposed by the latter for and on
account of the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Bouiver's Law
Dictionary, 3rd Ed., Vol. 1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner does not buy tickets for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his
</span>own account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As consignee, he
merely acts as an agent who has an obligation to remit the proceeds of the
sales or return anything left unsold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language,
Unabridged).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 15 of the Rules and Regulations of the PCSO, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petition </span>is obligated to turn over the
proceeds of his sale of tickets to the PCSO and render an accounting not later
than five (5) days (later amended to ten (10) days) after the corresponding
draw.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement proves that the
petitioner is a consignee of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>the
s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">weepstakes funds a</span>nd,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>therefore, an accountable officer. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>He turns in his collections and renders an
accounting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PCSO rules and regulations must be related to the consignment
invoices issued to the petitioner because the consignment invoices by which the
petitioner received the tickets from the PCSO state that he received the
tickets under the following terms:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"It is understood that I shall be held liable if any of the above
booklets are lost under any circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>I likewise bind myself to comply strictly with existing rules and
regulations and turn over to the PHILIPPINE CHARITY SWEEPSTAKES OFFICE, the
proceeds of the sale of these tickets."</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Section 5 of the rules and regulations of the PCSO
states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Fidelity</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

employees shall be bonded in accordance with the provision of Section 314 of
the Revised Administrative Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
amount of the bonds shall be determined and fixed by the Management in
accordance with the accountability of the officials and employees concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"All bonds (Fidelity &amp; Surety) shall be processed,
approved, and kept by the Central Office, the Branch Office to be duly advised
thereof and the date of their expiration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bonds used in the Central Office can not be used in the Branch Office
and vice-versa.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Cashier shall not issue tickets in excess of the bond or
credit margin (as defined in Section 12) of each fieldman or authorized seller
as certified by the bookkeeper otherwise, he shall be held liable for any
consequence arising therefrom."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner admits that he was bonded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bond and what it stands for are
additional proof that Lim is an accountable officer of the PCSO.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the term "<u>turn</u> <u>over</u>", the
petitioner states that this signifies he was only civilly liable for the value
of the sweepstakes tickets.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is not in the least bit convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 15 of the Rules and Regulations must
be read in the context of the consignment invoice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that under this regulation, as
amended, the petitioner has to settle his ticket "account in full" shows
that he is obligated to turn over whatever amounts he realizes from the sale of
the said tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sweepstakes funds are
considered public funds within the purview of Article 217 of the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Angco, 103 Phil.
33) His failure to turn over the proceeds of the sale of tickets makes him
criminally liable and not civilly liable as he suggests.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention that he was extended a running
account so that all his transactions constitute a series of continuing entries
which must be closed as a condition precedent to establish any criminal
liability deserves scant consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We agree with the lower court's findings, adopted by the appellate
court, that:</p>

<blockquote>"Neither is it correct to say that accused Ongkiko's account
was running or open in such a way that no liability is due from him except that
which would appear after the account or the dealings between the parties are
closed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All reasonable intendments
deducible from the nature of accused Ongkiko's position as sales supervisor,
from the provisions of the Rules and Regulations governing complainant's Field
Force, from the documents covering said accused's ticket transactions with
complainant, and from the manner in which the accounts of said accused are
kept, tend to the unavoidable conclusion that the accounts were strictly on a
draw-by-draw basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, the mere fact
that instances there may have been when remittances were applied partly to one
draw and partly to another, or that payments have at times been receipted for
as 'For account only' or that the accused may have time and again been allowed
to apply to his account his per diems or traveling allowance or even his
agent's share in prizes won, does not detract from the firm fact that his
liability for account and remittance of proceeds of the sales of tickets
accrues for each individual draw.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, same such practices may have been asserted to, if at all, merely
for accounting convenience and expediency but do not in any way change the
nature of the accused's accountability for each and every draw
separately." (pp. 43-44, Rollo).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">With regard to the petitioner's argument that his liability has
not been determined due to the fact that the action for accounting which he filed
in another court is still pending, suffice it to say that the petitioner has
not given substantial reasons why we should disturb the findings of the lower
courts attesting to his shortage in the amount of P26,374.73.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the discrepancies
alleged by the petitioner have been satisfactorily explained by Rosario R.
Yniguez, the Chief of the Credit Accounts Division both in her affidavit
(Exhibit B) and in her testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
brought to the court the original subsidiary ledger covering the petitioner's
accounts (Exhibits CC, CC-1, to CC-130).</p>

<p class="BODY">Another argument posed by the petitioner is the alleged lack of
evidence to show that he misappropriated the sweepstakes tickets, or applied
the proceeds thereof to his personal benefit and gain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, he simply had uncollected
amounts due from his agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is far from what appears in the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner unconditionally reported the sales of tickets as
made on a cash basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he
specifically issued corresponding "Cash Sales Invoices", copies of
which were submitted to the PCSO (Exhibits X, X-1 to X-9, Y, Y-1 to Y-16, Z,
Z-1 to Z-11) and for the amounts representing their value, he submitted to the
Office "Abstract of Collections and Cash Sales" (Exhibits X-10, Y-17
and Z-12).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, his account was
examined by the auditor and he was found to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">short in </span>the amount of P26,374.13.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A demand was then made for him to produce
this amount but he failed to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, under Art. 217 of the Revised Penal Code, he is deemed to
have misappropriated the proceeds from the sales of the tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since the petitioner represented to the
PCSO that he sold the tickets in cash, he is now estopped to claim that his
sales were merely on credit or consignment basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's claim that the sale of tickets on credit or on
consignment basis is not prohibited by the rules and regulations of the PCSO is
belied by the very rule he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">cites.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Section 4 of the Rules specifically
provides that "x x x <u>Under</u> <u>no</u> <u>circumstances</u> <u>shall</u>
<u>a</u> <u>credit</u> <u>arrangement</u> <u>be</u> <u>made</u> <u>between</u> <u>fieldmen</u>
<u>and</u> <u>authorized</u> <u>sellers</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Underscoring supplied). </p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that it is a common practice of the field supervisors to
deliver their tickets to their agents on consignment basis is no
justification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the
following findings of the lower court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:
3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x The mere fact that other sales supervisors
may have indeed resorted to the practice cannot legalize the same and neither
can accused Ongkiko invoke said unauthorized practice to ward off liability for
his clear violation of his own trust and express undertaking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True, the constant urgings of complainants
administrators for the sales supervisors to exert more effort in their sales
campaigns and to expand as such as possible their respective sales forces came
thick and fast throughout accused Ongkiko's incumbency as sales supervisor Yet,
nowhere in any of the memoranda dispatched for this purpose was it as much as
intimated that the administration sanctioned the sale of tickets to authorized
sellers on credit. On the contrary, every now and then, reminders like the
following -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"'In passing, however, we wish to remind you to follow, always
and strictly, office rules and regulations particularly punctual settlement of
ticket accounts, prompt submission of sales reports, confinement of sales to
agents within our assigned territory (Exhibit 3-I).'</p>

<blockquote>are given (See also:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit 4C, 4-O).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So much <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">so
</span>that, if to boost his own sales output and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">thus </span>maintain a good standing in complainant's supervisory sales
force, accused Ongkiko resorted to the practice of disposing tickets on credit
or consignment basis, that was his own look-out and he cannot now use his own
violation of the Rules and Regulations to shield himself from liability if, as
it turned out, the practice backfired on him." (pp. 84-85, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the petitioner's alleged loss of tickets due to a
vehicular accident, we quote with approval <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the </span>trial court's findings that:</p>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-tab-count:5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Neither is the alleged loss
consequent to the accident he figured in of any exonerative effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, not only is accused Ongkiko expressly
liable for loss 'under any circumstances' but also, such loss, although
supposedly reported to the Police (Exhibits 14 and 14-A), was never seasonably
brought to the attention of complainant and much less did said accused ever
attempt to ask for relief from responsibility therefor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His move at this time to invoke this in
further abatement of his liability is apparently only an eleventh-hour afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 85-86, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the evidence against the petitioner, we see no
reversible error in the conclusions of the two courts below that the petitioner
is guilty of the crime of malversation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All the elements of the said crime:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>1) that the offender is a public officer; 2) that he has custody or
control of funds or property by reason of the duties of his office; 3) that
those funds or property are public funds or property for which he is
accountable; and 4) that he misappropriated, took or consented or through
abandonment or negligence, permitted another to take them (See Reyes, The
Revised Penal Code, Book II, 1981 Rev. Ed., p. 391 and Padilla, Criminal Law,
Vol II, 10th Ed., p. 538) are present.</p>
