of her total concern, love and devotion to me and in turn I lavished her with
all the material comfort at my command and even tried to build up her social
status by sending her as a delegate to the <span class="SpellE">Zonta</span>
World Conference at Washington, D.C. last July, 1980 without my company. As a
token of my love and unfailing trust we went sight-seeing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and on our </span>second honeymoon to <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> only last month.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime during the last week of October, 1980, while I went
on my normal work routine to <span class="SpellE">Passi</span> Sugar <span class="SpellE">Millsite</span> in <span class="SpellE">Passi</span>, Iloilo, my son
Edmund took me aside in confidence and told me that he has some very delicate
matters to take up with me which may be misinterpreted by me or may be taken by
me in a wrong light; however, he said that the honor and dignity of the family
is at stake and I have to know it whatever be the consequence. After I gave him
the go signal, he narrated to me that my wife Cecile <span class="SpellE">Sorianosos</span>
has been unfaithful to me and has been having illicit relationship with another
man. Of course, I was taken aback and stunned so I asked him for the source of
his information. He informed me that our maid Elsa <span class="SpellE">Barios</span>
and our driver Loreto <span class="SpellE">Reales</span> had been aware of the
illicit relationship and the man usually went to my house and even slept there
whenever I was in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>. I got
angry and blamed our maid and the driver for not telling me but Edmund told me
that they were afraid to tell because they were threatened. After I have calmed
down, I commented that if I confront my wife about her illicit relationship,
she will surely deny it. So I thought that the best way was to catch her
red-handed in the act of infidelity so that she could not deny it anymore. I
suggested to Edmund to think of a plan so we can catch my wife red-handed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After several days of planning we agreed to put our plan of
action in operation on <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11">November 3,
 1980</st1:date> since I will be leaving for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in the morning of that day. Our problem was how to catch my wife in the very
act of having sexual intercourse with her lover considering the fact that our
master's room was air-conditioned with all windows framed by glass jalousies
closed and covered by curtains. At first we thought of breaking down the main
door with a sledge hammer so we could take them by surprise, later we abandoned
the idea because of legal complications.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, I thought of removing a glass of the <span class="SpellE">jalousy</span> so the inside of the bedroom can be seen from the
outside once the curtain can be brushed aside by means of a thin wire and the
persons on bed could be seen clearly since the bed is on the same level as the
opening of the window. After several experiments whenever my wife was out, I
found out that my wife cannot notice the removal of the glass <span class="SpellE">jalousy</span> since our windows are screened from the inside of
our room.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As pre-arranged, I removed one <span class="SpellE">jalousy</span>
glass of the window of our master room so that the people inside our room could
be seen actually from the outside and the moment my wife and her lover is seen
in the act of sexual intercourse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Having completed all the plans to <span class="GramE">effect</span>
our plan of operation, I told my wife that I was leaving in the morning of <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1980</st1:date> for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and actually I took the plane for <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on that day. I instructed my son Edmund to inform me immediately of the result
of the plan of action as soon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>possible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Almost <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1980</st1:date>, I was informed by
my daughter-in-law Rebecca that the operation was successful and resulted in
the arrest of my wife and Atty. Bob <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> inside
our bedroom.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"I know Atty. Bob <span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> for
quite a time and we have been close friends. As a friend he has come to our
house at <span class="SpellE">Molo</span>, Iloilo City oftentimes to discuss
matters about the court case between the Iloilo City Government and St. Therese
Memorial Chapel which is a business which I have given to my wife Cecile. Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Javellana</span> knew that Cecile <span class="SpellE">Sorianosos</span>
is my legally married wife.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1980</st1:date>, I was
shown the photographs taken inside our master bedroom and I am attaching hereto
the photographs which are marked as Annexes "C", "D",
"E", "F", "G", "H", "I" and

P. Nicolas "commenced with the statement 'the under­signed fiscal accuses <span class="SpellE">Engracio</span> Santos with the crime of rape,' the offended party
not having been mentioned at all as one of the accusers." In the instant

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Undoubtedly, the
complaint-affidavit filed by <span class="SpellE">Santibañez</span> contains all
the elements of a valid complaint, as "it states the names of the
defendants, the designation of the offense by the statute, the acts or omission
complained of as constituting the offense; the name of the offended party, the
approximate time of the commission of the offense, and the place wherein the
offense was committed."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">What is more, said

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in
a case where the Fiscal filed an Information charging the accused with 'telling
some people in the neighborhood that said <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span>
Bravo (a married woman) was a paramour of one <span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span>,
a man not her husband', and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> Bravo did not
subscribe to the complaint, this Court held that the trial court had no
jurisdic­tion over the case. It ruled that since the accused imputed to <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> Bravo the commission of adultery, a crime which can­not
be prosecuted de <span class="SpellE">oficio</span>, the Inform­ation filed by
the Fiscal cannot confer jurisdiction upon the court of origin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It must be noted, however, that this error could be corrected
without sustaining the motion to quash and dis­missing the case. Pursuant to
section 1 of paragraph (a) of Presidential Decree No. 77, under which the
Assistant City Fiscal conducted the preliminary investigation, the statement of
the complainant was sworn to before the aforesaid Investigating Fiscal.
Assuming that the recitals in said sworn statement contain all those required
of a complaint under the rules, a copy of said verified statement of the
complainant should be filed with respondent Court in order to comply with the
requirements of Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code; otherwise, the
respondent Fiscal should file with said court a verified complaint of the
offended party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Upon these premises, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot but conclude that the adultery charge against
private respondents is being prosecuted "upon complaint filed by the
