Chairman of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) until his retirement on <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1986">April 1, 1986</st1:date>, be computed on the
basis of the highest monthly salary plus cost of living allowance (COLA) and
representation and transportation allowance (RATA) or solely on the basis of
highest monthly salary without said allowances?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is the issue that confronts the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="18" year="1988">August 18, 1988</st1:date>,
the petitioner wrote a letter to the Commission on Audit (COA) Chairman,
coursed through the CSC Chairman, requesting an opinion on whether or not the
money value of the terminal leave of retired Constitutional Commission members
should include the allowances received at the time of retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, in his letter, further stated
that while retired members of other Constitutional Commissions received
terminal leave pay computed on the basis of highest<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>monthly salary including allowances, the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span>
terminal leave was computed solely on the basis of highest monthly salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a First <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> to the COA
Chairman on <st1:date month="9" day="1" year="1988">September 1, 1988</st1:date>,
the CSC Chairman recommended the approval of the petitioner’s request for
payment of the money value of his terminal leave based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">on </span>salary plus allowances.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 28, 1989, the COA rendered Decision No. 992
(hereinafter referred to as the COA decision) stating that “in line with the
action taken by this Commission in the previous similar cases of former COA
Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>
and Silvestre D. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,” the COA “will interpose
no objection” to the petitioner’s claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the petitioner’s request for payment of terminal leave
differential representing the unpaid COLA and RATA amounting to P111<span class="GramE">,229.04</span>, the CSC Chairman informed the petitioner that the
release of the corresponding advice of allotment and cash outlay to cover the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">payment </span>of his terminal leave
differential had already been requested from the Department of Budget and
Management (DBM).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">On </span><st1:date month="1" day="25" year="1990">January 25, 1990</st1:date>, in a letter
addressed to the CSC Chairman, the DBM denied the petitioner’s request for
payment of terminal leave differential for the following reasons, among others:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Computation of the money
value of vacation and sick leave is based on “basic pay” or “basic salary”
pursuant to the provisions of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by
R.A. No. 1081.</p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Under Section 2(1) of
P.D. No. 1146, the term salary refers to the basic pay or salary received by an
employee, excluding per diems, bonuses, overtime pay and allowance.</p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>The cases of former COA
Commissioners <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>
cannot be validly invoked as precedents for purposes of DBM Budgetary action
since said claims were processed without prior involvement of the DBM.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with the DBM refusal to release the corresponding
allotment, the CSC yielded to DBM instead of asserting its initial
determination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It issued Resolution No.
90-514 dated <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1990">May 30, 1990</st1:date>
wherein the Commission deemed it proper not to rule on the issue on “ethical
considerations” and “compulsions of <span class="SpellE">delicadeza</span>” and
advised the petitioner to file an action for declaratory relief (sic) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>the issue with the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> sought
reconsideration of CSC Resolution No. 90-514, reasoning that neither the CSC
Resolution nor the opinion of the DBM Secretary could prevail over the COA
decision which had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="18" year="1990">October 18, 1990</st1:date>,
the CSC issued Resolution No. 90-945 denying reconsideration of the
petitioner’s case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Inspite</span>
of the CSC Chairman’s earlier approval of the claim for payment, the CSC ruled
that the COA decision “has no sufficient legal mooring and therefore cannot be
the basis for allowing payment of the claims.” The Resolution likewise cited a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">J</span>une 13, 1990 letter from former Court
Administrator <span class="SpellE">Meynardo</span> A <span class="SpellE">Tiro</span>
informing the CSC that “the money value of the terminal leave credits of the
Justices of the Supreme Court and other members of the Judiciary is based only
on the highest basic salary (plus longevity pay) but excluding RATA as
certified to by our Director of Fiscal Management and Budget Office.”<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Secretary of Budget and Management was ordered <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> try the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>resolution
dated <st1:date month="1" day="31" year="1991">January <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 9.0pt">31, </span>1991</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner seeks the nullification of CSC Resolution Nos.
90-514 and 90-945.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He urges that the COA
decision which interposed no objection to the computation of his terminal leave
pay based on salary plus allowances had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> since no timely appeal had been taken <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent CSC, on the other hand, maintains that the COA
decision is not final and conclusive since <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">said </span>decision merely stated that the COA will not interpose any
objection to the payment of the petitioner’s claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, respondent CSC <span class="GramE">adds</span>, the determination of the legality of claims on leave
matters is within the province of the CSC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this preliminary issue, the Court rules against the
petitioner’s assertion that the COA decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and, therefore, beyond review; that the DBM has
no alternative but to obey it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article
IX-A, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution provides:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“<span class="GramE">xxx</span>
</span>Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision,
order or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on <i>certiorari</i>
by the aggrieved party within thirty (30) days from receipt of a copy thereof.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-cited article refers to an aggrieved party raising <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>decision to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately for the petitioner, neither the
Civil Service Commission nor the Secretary of Budget and Management may be
viewed as an aggrieved party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The CSC is
not an aggrieved party because it recommended the approval of the petitioner’s
request for payment of terminal leave computed on the basis of his monthly
salary plus allowances and likewise interceded in behalf of the petitioner for
the release of funds from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">DBM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The COA upheld this initial
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor is the DBM an aggrieved
party because it was not privy to the case before the COA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even if the DBM was eventually
apprised of the COA decision, the <span class="SpellE">DBM’s</span> recourse was
not to bring the matter on a petition for <i>certiorari</i> before the
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the agency tasked to release
government funds, it simply ignored the COA ruling with which it
disagreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It refused to approve the
release of allotment and outlay for terminal leave differential since in its
opinion, payment thereof had no legal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The records do not show any authority of COA to compel acceptance of its
ruling in this particular case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent <span class="SpellE">CSC’s</span> stance, however,
that it is the body empowered to determine the legality of claims on leave
matters, to the exclusion of COA, is not well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the implementation and enforcement of
leave benefits are matters within the functions of the CSC as the central
personnel agency of the government, the duty to examine accounts and
expenditures relating to leave benefits properly pertains to the COA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where government expenditures or use of funds
is involved, the CSC cannot claim an exclusive domain simply because leave
matters are also involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The COA, the CSC, and the Commission on Elections are equally pre-eminent
in their respective spheres.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither one
may claim dominance over the others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
case of conflicting rulings, it is the Judiciary which interprets the meaning
of the law and ascertains which view shall prevail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic question for the Court’s consideration is whether or
not RATA and COLA should be added to the highest monthly salary in computing
the petitioner’s terminal leave pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner anchors his claim on the Memorandum Order issued
by President Marcos on <st1:date month="11" day="20" year="1980">November 20,
 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, this
Memorandum Order was also the basis for the COA decision, invoked by the
petitioner as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, interposing no
objection to his claim for terminal leave differential.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Memorandum Order reads:</p>

automatically benefit others not mentioned therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it has persuasive value as a matter of
contemporaneous interpretation especially as regards Presidential Decrees or

of Budget and Management, advances the argument that there is no provision in
Administrative Order No. 444, or in any other law, which expressly authorizes
the inclusion of allowances in the computation of the money value of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>petitioner’s accumulated leaves.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from RA 910 as amended that the five-year gratuity is

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General stresses that under Section 286 of the
Revised Administrative Code, as amended by Republic Act No. 1081 and Executive
Order No. 1077, the computation of the money value of the terminal leave pay is
based only on monthly basic salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 286 of the Revised Administrative Code, as amended by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">RA </span>No. 1081, states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 286.</span> <span class="GramE">When
vacation leave and sick leave may be taken.</span> - Vacation leave and sick
leave shall be cumulative and any part thereof which may not be taken within
the calendar year in which earned may be carried over to the succeeding years,
but whenever any officer, employee, or laborer of the Government of the
Philippines shall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">voluntarily</span>
resign or be separated from the service through no fault of his own, he shall
be entitled to the commutation of all accumulated vacation and/or sick leaves
to his credit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That the total
vacation leave and sick leave that can accumulate to the credit of any officer
of employee shall, in no case, exceed ten months:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, further, That the proper Department
Head may in his discretion authorize the <u>commutation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">salary</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>that would be received during the
period of vacation and sick leave of any appointed officer or employee or
teacher or laborer of the Philippine Government and direct its payment on or
before the beginning of such leave from the fund out of which the salary would
have been paid:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, furthermore,
That no person whose leave has been commuted following his separation from the
service shall be reappointed or reemployed under the Government of the
Philippines before the expiration of the leave commuted unless he first refunds
the money value of the unexpired portion of the leave commuted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining supplied)”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(Executive Order No. 1077 later amended Section 286 by removing
the limitation on the number of days of vacation and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">sick </span>leaves that a retiree may accumulate, although all employees
are required to go on a minimum of five days vacation leave annually.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The only provision in Section 286 of the Revised Administrative
Code, as amended, which could seemingly support the Solicitor General’s <span class="GramE">view</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>the
above underlined clause which allows the “commutation of salary” of a
government officer, employee or laborer.</p>

<p class="BODY">“Commutation of salary” as used in Section 286 is, however, not
the same as “commutation of leave credits”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The former is applied for by an employee <u>during</u> <u>employment</u>
when he goes on <u>ordinary</u> <u>leave</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if his Department Head allows it, the employee may receive his
salary for the period of the vacation or sick leave <u>before</u> the beginning
of such leave; otherwise, he gets his salary only on the pay days covered by
the vacation or s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">i</span>ck leave
period or upon returning to work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
contrast, commutation of leave credits, more commonly known as terminal leave,
is applied for by an officer or employee who retires, resigns or is separated
from the service through no fault of his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Manual on Leave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">A</span>dministration
Course for Effectiveness published by the Civil Service Commission, pages
16-17).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise of sound
personnel policy, the Government encourages unused leaves to be
accumulated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government recognizes
that for most public servants, retirement pay is always less than generous if
not meager and scrimpy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A modest nest
egg which the senior citizen may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">look </span>forward
to is thus provided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Terminal leave
payments are given not only at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">same </span>time but also for the same policy
considerations governing retirement benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since terminal leave is applied for by an officer or employee who
has already severed his connection with his employer and who is no longer
working, then it follows that the terminal leave pay, which is the cash value
of his accumulated leave credits, should not be treated as compensation for
services rendered at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Re:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Request of Atty. Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Zialcita</span>,
190 SCRA 851 [1990]) It can not be viewed as salary for purposes which would
reduce it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE"><u>supra</u></span>)
There can thus be no “commutation of salary” when a government retiree applies
for terminal leave because he is not receiving it as salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What he applies for is a “commutation of
leave credits.” It is an <span class="SpellE">accumulaton</span> of credits
intended for old age or separation from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Section 286 of the Revised
Administrative Code is not applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It cannot be construed as limiting the basis of the computation of
terminal leave pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>monthly
salary only.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the reasons which impelled the law to include
COLA and RATA in computing retirement benefits of certain officials, we rule
that terminal leave payments must also be governed by the same principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>COLA and RATA should be included in computing
the terminal leave credits when the officials retire or the official
relationship is lawfully terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General cites our ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Paredes</u></span>

position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Commonwealth Act (CA) No. 186, as amended, provides for the

Constitutional Commissions and those <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">whose
</span>retirement is not covered by special law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 12(c) of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">CA </span>186 reads:</p>

<blockquote>“(c) <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Retirement is likewise

appointive or elective, regardless of age and employment status, <span class="GramE">who</span> has rendered a total of at least twenty years of
service, the last three years of which are continuous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The benefit shall, in additional to the
return of his personal contributions with interest compounded monthly and the
payment of corresponding employer’s premiums described in subsection (a) of
Section five hereof, without interest, be only a gratuity equivalent to one
month’s salary for every year of the first twenty years of service, plus one
and one-half month’s salary for every year of service over twenty but below
thirty years and two month’s salary for every year of service over thirty years
in case of employees based on the highest rate received and in case of elected
officials on the rates of pay as provided by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> Officials and

<p class="BODY">Under the last sentence, officials and employees retired under CA
186, as amended, shall be entitled to the commutation of the vacation and sick
leave credits based on the <u>highest</u> <u>rate</u> <u>received</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Paredes</u></span> <u>v</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span><u>Acting</u> <u>Chairman</u>, <u>supra</u>, the Court construed
the phrase “highest rate received” as referring to the retiree’s “highest
monthly salary”:</p>

<blockquote>“The foregoing legal provision (Section 12(c) of CA 186 requires
the computation of the money value of the terminal leave to be based on the
retiree’s highest rate received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And a
reading of the entire provision shows that the highest rate received refers to
the retiree’s highest monthly salary.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner in that case was a former Assistant City Auditor
of Manila who sought to have his RATA included in the computation of his
terminal leave pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court therein
held that “allowances are not considered part of salary for purposes of
retirement and payment of the money value of terminal leave.”</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted, however, that the Court, in that case,
construed “highest rate received” as highest monthly salary mainly because the
retirement gratuity received by employees under Section 12(c) of CA 186 is
based only on <u>monthly</u> <u>salary</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, under the aforementioned provision, the benefit for employees
shall be “a gratuity equivalent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>one
month’s <u>salary</u> for every year of the first twenty years of service, plus
one and one-half month’s <u>salary</u> for every year of service over 20 but
below 30 years and two months’ <u>salary</u> for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">every year </span>of service over thirty years xxx <u>based</u> <u>on</u>
<u>the</u> <u>highest</u> <u>rate</u> <u>received</u> xxx Officials and
employees retired <u>under</u> <u>this</u> <u>act</u> shall be entitled to the
commutation of the unused vacation and sick leave, <u>based</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>highest</u> <u>rate</u> <u>received</u> xxx.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Underlining supplied.)</p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of Section 12(c) of CA 186 therefore reveals <span class="GramE">an intent</span> on the part of the legislature to provide a
uniform basis in computing both the retirement gratuity and the terminal leave
pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In CA 186, that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>uniform basis is <u>salary</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A different law, R.A. 910 as amended, governs the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of members of
the Judiciary and Constitutional Commissions, the basis in computing the retirement
gratuity is the highest monthly salary <u>plus</u> <u>the</u> <u>highest</u> <u>monthly</u>
<u>aggregate</u> <u>of</u> <u>transportation,</u> <u>living</u> <u>and</u> <u>representation</u>
<u>allowance</u> <u>(COLA</u> <u>and</u> <u>RATA)</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same rule of uniformity which we applied
in <span class="SpellE"><u>Paredes</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Acting</u> <u>Chairman</u>
for those retiring under CA 186 as amended should also apply for those who
retire under R.A. 910 as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
rate used in computing retirement gratuities also applies in the computation of
terminal leave credits.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic that retirement laws <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">are </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">liberally </span>construed
and administered in favor of the persons intended to be benefited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All doubts as to the intent of the law should
be resolved in favor of the retiree to achieve its humanitarian purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(In Re:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Although terminal leave pay is not synonymous with, and is not a
part of, the five-year lump sum gratuity provided under RA 910 as amended and
Administrative Order No. 444, the former may, in a broad sense, partake of the
nature of a gratuity rather than actual salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A gratuity is that paid to the beneficiary for past services rendered
purely out of generosity of the giver or grantor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Peralta v. Auditor General, 100 Phil 1051
[1957]) It is a mere bounty given by the government in consideration or in
recognition of meritorious services and springs from the appreciation and
graciousness of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Pirovano</span> v. De La <span class="SpellE">Rama</span> Steamship
Co., 96 Phil. 335, 357 [1954]) While it is true that vacation and sick leave
credits are earned during one’s period of employment, they are, by their very
nature and purpose, supposed to be enjoyed or exhausted during employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When these accumulated leave benefits are
allowed to be accumulated, not to be paid while one is working but to be reserved
for old age, then this constitutes the gratuity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Through the years, laws pertaining to accumulation of leave
credits show a liberal trend with a view to favoring the retiring
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Act 2711 (dated <st1:date month="3" day="10" year="1917">March 10, 1917</st1:date>), accumulated leaves
that may be commuted cannot exceed 5 months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Republic Act No. 1081 (dated <st1:date month="6" day="15" year="1954">June
 15, 1954</st1:date>) increased the limit from <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5</st1:time>
to 10 months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the passage of
Executive Order No. 1077 on <st1:date month="1" day="9" year="1986">January 9,
 1986</st1:date>, the retiring employee became entitled to the commutation of <u>all</u>
accumulated vacation and sick leaves to his credit, without limitation as to
the number of days of vacation and sick leave that he may accumulate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since terminal leave pay may also be considered a gratuity, then
applying the rule on liberal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">interpretation
of retirement laws, the basis for its computation in the case of members of the
Judiciary and Constitutional Commissions must be the same as that used in
computing the 5-year lump sum gratuity under RA 910 as amended and
Administrative Order No. 444.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court is cognizant of

</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the terminal leave pay of
members of the Judiciary and Constitutional Commissions is computed only on the
basis of highest basic monthly salary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If, for example a member
of the CSC has </span>an accumulated leave credit of one month and, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the two months immediately prior to retiring,

upon </span>retirement, applies for the commutation of his accumulated leave
credit of one month, following the proposition of the Solicitor General, he
will receive terminal leave pay equivalent only to one month’s salary, <u>without</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COLA</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><u>and</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

penalized for faithfully working continuously and not consuming his leave
credits until his last working day?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
should the basis for the commutation of leave credits be different just because
he chose to avail himself of his leave benefits immediately before and not
immediately after retirement?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely
this disparity in consequence could not have been intended by our lawmakers.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is more reason now to include COLA in the computation of
terminal leave pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 12 of
Republic Act 6758, known as the Compensation and Position Classification Act of
1989, mandated the integration of COLA to the basic salary and, therefore, to the
retirement pay of all employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
it is true that RA 6758 took effect only on <st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1989">July 1, 1989</st1:date>, long after petitioner had already retired
on <st1:date month="4" day="1" year="1986">April 1, 1986</st1:date>, his COLA
should nevertheless have been included in computing terminal leave pay for the
same reasons stated above.</p>

retired as far back as decades ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
provided a cut-off date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same
practical considerations and budgetary restraints constrain the Court to impose

of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COLA and </span>RATA as basis in
