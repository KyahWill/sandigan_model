				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Convicted by the Court of First Instance of Misamis Occidental of robbery with homicide and serious physical injuries, based mainly on the testimony of Nilo Junio, a 15-year old boy, and sentenced to <i>Reclusion Perpetua</i>, Lino Gregorio now appeals to this Court.<br><br>Evidence shows that in the evening of June 6, 1971, 15-year old Nilo Junio, an elder married brother, Alfredo Junio, and his four younger brothers were sleeping in their house situated in Talingting, a mountainous barrio in Aloran, Misamis Occidental. Their parents, together with Nilo's elder sister and Alfredo's wife, had left in the early afternoon of said date for Toril, same province. At midnight, Nilo Junio was awakened by gunfire and the pounding at the door of their house. Frightened, Nilo, who was lying in the kitchen, proceeded to the bedroom, climbed up the storage compartment for the mats and pillows, and peeping through a hole saw five men outside, some of whom were firing until the door latch was destroyed. Thereafter, three of the intruders entered, all armed with guns. One of the men asked Alfredo Junio where the money was kept but the latter answered that they had none. Thereupon, Alfredo was struck with a gun at the forearm that felled him. The other two men entered the room, ransacked the trunks and boxes and finding no money, they transferred to another room but also found nothing.<br><br>Returning to Alfredo who was now able to stand up, the men again asked him where the money was kept. Alfredo took the piggy bank containing P60.00 hidden in the ceiling and after handing it to the robbers, he was shot at three times, killing him. All this was seen by Nilo Junio because of a kerosene light burning in the sala.<br><br>Afterwards, one of the robbers entered the room, and seeing Nilo Junio in the pillow compartment fired and hit him at the left forearm and left chest. Luckily, the bullet did not penetrate his chest because of a breastbone which obstructed it. The robber fired a second shot at Nilo but missed. Seeing the robber about to fire at him for the third time, Nilo jumped from the storage compartment but he was stabbed by the robber at the right hip. As a result, he fell and cried. As for Nilo's younger brothers they were able to hide from the malefactors. Thereafter, the men left.<br><br>Arriving at early dawn of June 7, 1971, Beatriz Junio found her son, Alfredo, already dead and Nilo, wounded. Nilo was carried by his barriomates to the town of Aloran, passed by the municipal building, and thence to the Misamis Occidental Provincial Hospital at Oroquieta where he was confined for more than two weeks.<br><br>The main issue in this case is the identity of the appellant as one of the malefactors.<br><br>Early morning of June 7, 1971, shortly after the commission of the crime, Nilo was rushed in a pedicab from Aloran to the Oroquieta Provincial Hospital. The pedicab stopped for a while at the municipal building of Aloran and Pat. Hirohito Macalisang talked with Nilo. Pat. Macalisang testified among others, as<br>follows:<br>&nbsp;<br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="3%"><div align="justify">"</div></td> <td width="15%"><div align="justify">Q - </div></td> <td width="82%"><div align="justify">On June 7, 1971, in the very early morning of that day, you remember having come across a person bringing a boy named Nilo Junio in the municipal building of Aloran?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">A -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Yes.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Why were you there in the municipal building of Aloran, in the early morning of June 7, 1971?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">A -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Because I was the guard there.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Please tell the Court what was the purpose of this person of bringing that boy named Nilo Junio in the municipal building of Aloran, Misamis Oca, in that early morning of June 7, 1971?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">A -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I asked him what happened to them and this Nilo Junio answered that they where robbed.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Q - </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What more question did you ask to Nilo Junio regarding his answer that they were robbed?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">A -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I also asked him whether he recognized the person who robbed them.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">Q -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What was the answer?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">A -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">He answered he did not recognize them because it was night time. ?"

Macalisang was not rebutted by Nilo Junio or by any other prosecution witness.<br><br>On June 10, 1971 a policeman brought two persons for the identification of Nilo Junio. Nilo told the policeman that they were not the robbers. The policeman returned with another man to have him identified by Junio who stated that he was not one of the malefactors.<br><br>On June 11 Pat. Macalisang, on orders of Sgt. Faustino Labares, brought the appellant Lino Gregorio, to Nilo Junio for identification. What took place during the confrontation was testified to by four witnesses, two for the prosecution and two for the defense. Nilo Junio, on cross examination, testified as follows:<br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="3"><div align="justify"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div align="justify">" ATTY.

Thus, the Solicitor General, in his brief said:<br><blockquote> "As soon as Lino Gregorio and policeman Macalisang had departed, Nilo Junio immediately confided to his mother that the fellow just presented to him was the one who shot and stabbed him (pp. 66, 67, tsn, Suan); whereupon she left for Aloran and reported to Chief Labares the revelation made by her son (pp. 6, 7, 10, 11, tsn, Suan;p. 18, tsn, Jamorol). Sgt. Labares repaired to the hospital to whom Nilo Junio gave a statement (Exhs. G-4, G-7) positively identifying Lino Gregorio as one of the culprits and the one who shot and stabbed him (pp. 19, 25, tsn, Jamorol; pp. 6, 143, rec). Consequently, Lino Gregorio was apprehended and brought to the PC headquarters for investigation (p. 11, tsn, Suan.)" (pp. 7-8, Solicitor's Brief) </blockquote>And, explaining why he did not point to the appellant as one of the malefactors during the confrontation at the hospital on June 11, 1971, Nilo stated that he was afraid. Hereunder is his testimony on this point:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td width="93%"> <div align="justify">Why were you afraid?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Because that fellow (appellant) was making noise and making movements of his arm.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Where was he doing those things-making noise and showing unusual movements of the hands?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">There, when he entered the hospital.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">What noise was he making?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He said: 'Where is that boy, where is that boy, this policeman is only guessing.'<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">To whom did he (appellant) address those words when he said where is the boy?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">The other patients.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Was he already inside your room in the hospital when he was uttering those words?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">And what movements of the hands did he make?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">He was pinpointing at me." (pp. 64-65, tsn, Suan.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The foregoing testimony does not indicate any threat which would make Nilo afraid. At any rate, the foregoing testimony of Nilo was denied by Pat. Macalisang who brought the appellant to the hospital. The patrolman testified as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="7%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="93%"><div align="justify">During the time that this Lino Gregorio was brought by you before Nilo Junio in the hospital, before you asked Nilo Junio whether the man you were bringing was the robber, did you notice any act made by Lino Gregorio?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">How did you conduct Lino Gregorio in the presence of Nilo Junio?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I held him.

(p. 48, tsn, Jamorol)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>The appellant also denied that he ever made any threatening acts during the confrontation at the hospital when he testified as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="8%"><div align="justify">' 'Q</div></td> <td width="92%"> <div align="justify">Nilo Junio in his direct testimony here declared that when you were conducted by a policeman in the Provincial Hospital at Oroquieta City to be identified by him if you were one of the culprits or one of the robbers on the night of June 6, 1971, he was forced to tell the policeman that you were not the one because he was afraid of you because you were brandishing your hands in a threatening mode to him.

As a matter of fact, I was being held by a policeman and the policeman asked Nilo Junio to identify me." (pp. 95-96, tsn, Suan)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>We find it difficult to believe the explanation of Nilo Junio why he did not identify the appellant during the confrontation at the hospital. There was no reason to be afraid. Assuming that what was uttered by the appellant were the words testified to by Nilo himself, there was no threat in the statement: "Where is that boy, where is that boy, the policeman is only guessing."<br>The Solicitor General, however, in his brief, made this unfortunate statement:<br><blockquote> "At any rate, any uncertainty (on whether there was a threat or not) in Nilo's testimony is dispelled by appellant's own admission that during the confrontation with Nilo at the Hospital, he told the boy, 'Do, be careful, you may be inviting' (p. 110, tsn, Suan) which words, even if said in a natural voice could have sufficiently cowed the ailing 15-year old into silence." (p. 14, Solicitor's Brief) </blockquote>The Solicitor misquoted what was allegedly stated by the appellant. A verification of the transcript shows that what was stated by the appellant was the following: "Do, be careful, you may be inventing," not <i>"inviting.</i> " "Inviting" may be a veiled threat to mean "inviting trouble" or "inviting danger" or "inviting harm." On the other hand, the correct word "inventing" does not convey any threat.<br><br>We are more inclined to believe that Nilo Junio pointed to Lino Gregorio as one of the malefactors&nbsp; on suggestion of the investigator Sgt. Faustino Labares. This came out during the examination of Nilo Junio by the court as follows:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr> <td colspan="2">"COURT:</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="9%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="91%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Q</td> <td> Do you know Sgt.

(pp. 66-67, tsn, Suan)</td> </tr> </tbody></table><blockquote> "... Her failure to mention in her report the fact that she could identify two of the alleged malefactors because she had previously known them at least by face—a very essential detail in the solution of a crime—engenders a suspicion that she was not altogether candid and truthful in her testimony. At any rate, the omission on so important a point, has rendered the evidence for the prosecution insufficient to establish appellants' guilty connection to the requisite degree of moral certainty." (People <i>vs. </i>David and Baesa, 75 Phil. 778) </blockquote>On the other hand, the appellant reacted very strongly against his being picked up as a suspect by Pat. Macalisang. Upon leaving the hospital, after Nilo Junio failed to identify him as one of the malefactors, the appellant confronted Pat. Macalisang, as follows:<br><br>&lt;blockquote&gt;"What is the business of bringing me here and being identified as a robber when in fact, I am not a robber?"<br><br>Pat. Macalisang replied, "This is the action of Labares (Sgt. Labares). This Labares is fond of suspecting." (p. 97, tsn, Suan)&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br><br>Upon learning that Sgt. Labares was responsible in his being brought to the hospital as a suspect, the appellant, instead of going home to his hometown in Jimenez, went directly to Aloran to see Sgt. Labares whom he found in the public market of Aloran. What took place in the market was brought out in the following examination conducted by the Court:<br><br><table  ="" align="center" border="0" width="75%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%"><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td width="95%"> <div align="justify">Did you actually see Sgt.

" (pp. 98-99, tsn, Suan)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Sergeant Labares was the only rebuttal witness for the prosecution; he did not rebut the foregoing testimony of the appellant.<br><br>Due to the doubtful identification of the appellant, We give credence to the alibi of the appellant. The evidence for the defense shows that at about 6:00 in the afternoon of June 6, 1971, the appellant took his meal in the carenderia of Bartolome Acedera in the Municipality of Jimenez, which is 10 kilometers from the Municipality of Aloran. The barrio of Talingting, where the crime was committed, is two hours away by hiking from the Municipality of Aloran. The appellant stayed in the carenderia of Acedera up to 10:00 in the evening together with four companions who joined him in drinking. Thereafter, the appellant and his companions left the carenderia and were met at the corner of Calderon and Washington Streets by Patrolmen Rufino Putis and Romeo Matratar who were then on patrol duty. Noticing that the appellant was drunk, Pat. Putis advised him to go home. Instead of going home, the appellant drank beer at the ABC Hall<br>&nbsp;with Ramon Jemino, after which he proceeded to the direction of his house but stopped at a waiting shed where he fell asleep. He was awakened by Cpl. Balais who told him to go home.<br>&nbsp;<br>The foregoing evidence was established by the testimonies of the appellant, Pat. Putis, Pat. Bala-is and Bartolome Acedera, the owner of the carinderia.<br><blockquote>"Where the evidence of the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of concreteness on the question on whether or not the defendant is the author of the crime charged, alibi as a defense assumes importance." (People vs. Bulawin, 29 SCRA 710.)<br><br>"Where the identification of the accused as the author of the crime is unreliable, his defense of alibi assumes importance and may be given credence. (People <i>vs. </i>Cunanan, 19 SCRA 769.)"<br><br>"Although alibi is the weakest defense that an accused can avail of, it acquired commensurate strength where no positive and proper identification has been satisfactorily made by witnesses of the offender's identity. (People vs. Baquiran, 20 SCRA 451.)"</blockquote>We believe that the guilt of the appellant has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is hereby reversed and the appellant acquitted, with costs <i>de oficio.</i><br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Teehankee (Chairman), Makasiar, Melencio-Herrera, Plana</i> and <i>Vasquez, JJ, </i>concur. <br><i>Gutierrez, J.,</i> dissents.<br><br><br><hr align="center" width="65%"><br><br><div align="center">DISSENTING OPINION<br></div><br><br>GUTIERREZ,<i> J.: </i><br><br>I am convinced from the records of this case that the guilt of defendant-appellant Lino Gregorio has been proved beyond reasonable doubt and that the decision of the lower court should .accordingly be affirmed.<br><br>I find eyewitness Nilo Junio both competent and credible. His detailed narration of the events relative to the robbery and the killing is clear and convincing. The evidence fails to show any mistaken identification of appellant Lino Gregorio. The defendant-appellant was not a stranger to Junio. The latter had known him prior to the incident. No motive appears in the records why Junio should single out Lino Gregorio from among several suspects to be one of the culprits in the grave crime of robbery with homicide. The identification was not only categorical— "Because he was the one who stabbed me"—but was repeated in other parts of his testimony as efforts to impeach his credibility were made.<br><br>What transpired in the hospital on June 10, 1971 was not a failure to identify but a silence arising from fear. As between the testimony of Patrolman Macalisang about the answer "No" accompanied by a swinging of the head and the testimony of Nilo Junio himself, I find the latter testimony more credible. When the appellant was brought before the hospital bed of the young witness, the appellant was loudly asking, "Where is that boy, where is that boy" and making threatening motions with his hands. The witness merely stared at the man who had inflicted the serious stab wound which almost killed him. The boy was afraid. But the day following the confrontation, Junio declared categorically in an affidavit taken by Sgt. Faustino Labares, that he recognized Lino Gregorio because he usually saw him in Aloran, Misamis Occidental and, in fact, could even recognize his voice.
