<p class="BODY">In our decision in this case promulgated on July 7, 1986 and which 
is now the subject of the motion for reconsideration filed by the Ministry of 
Social Services and Development, this Court emphasized that in adoption cases, 
the interest and welfare of the child is of paramount consideration and that 
"every reasonable intendment should be sustained to promote and fulfill these 
noble and compassionate objectives of the law (<span class="SpellE"><em>Malkinson</em></span><em> vs. Agrava</em>, 54 SCRA 66, and 
other cited cases) and the law should not be made, as instrument to impede the 
achievement of a salutary policy." <span class="GramE">(</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE"><em>Duncan</em></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"><em> 
vs. CFI of Rizal</em>, L-30576, 69 SCRA 298).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Applying the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> judicial 
guidelines, this Court directed the present Ministry of Social Services and 
Development "to forthwith issue without undue delay, the requisite travel 
clearance certificate in favor of herein petitioners' adopted child, Adam 
Christopher <span class="SpellE">Bobanovic</span>." In our decision, we stated 
that <span>"all </span>that MSSD had to do was to use a little of its time to 
verify the correctness of the case study report, prepared and submitted by the 
Social Worker who acted upon instruction of the court below."</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent's motion for reconsideration of the decision in this 
case, dated <st1:date month="8" day="5" year="1986">August 5, 1986</st1:date>, 
although filed late, in the interest of justice, was nevertheless admitted under 
our resolution of <st1:date month="9" day="5" year="1986">September 5, 
1986</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In said motion, public respondent stressed the 
existence of the 1981 Memorandum of Agreement between the State and Territory 
Adoption Authorities of Australia and the Ministry of Social Services and 
Development of the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Respondent Minister therein pointed out that under the stated Memorandum 
of Agreement, it has been agreed among others, the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">

<tr>
<td width="33%">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<blockquote>"1.4<span class="GramE">.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>The</em></span><em> 
adoption authorities in both countries will jointly approve of prospective 
adopting parents and the selection of particular adoptive parents for a 
particular child</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 140)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">Respondent Minister further averred that 
certain significant procedures have been accepted and agreed to be observed, 
such as:</p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span> 
</span><span>&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"4.1.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Any person or persons having their ordinary 
place of residence in an Australian State or Territory, who wish to adopt a 
child from the Philippines will apply to the Director of the appropriate 
Australian State or Territory investigated; where he is satisfied that the 
applicants are fit and proper persons to adopt a child from the Philippines, he 
will cause the preparation of a detailed Family Study and will act as 
intermediary and forward the Family Study to the Philippines for 
consideration.&nbsp; Only family studies presented by an appropriate 
<st1:place><st1:placename>Australian</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> or Territory Adoption 
Authority to the Philippine Ministry of Social Services and Development will be 
considered</em><span>.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"4.2.<em> In any application for approval, as persons fit and proper 
to adopt a child from the Philippines, the following will be conditions 
precedent to the approval of the application by the Australian State or 
Territory Adoption Authorities</em>:<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"(a). A<em>pplicants must have attained the ages specified in the 
appropriate laws of both countries and be in a position to support and care for 
their family</em>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"(b) <em>The State or Territory Adoption Authority investigating an 
application will confirm that applicants have no criminal record or else make 
appropriate comment on that record." (Rollo, pp. 141-142)</em></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court is constrained to consider the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> matters.<span>&nbsp; </span>We note the assertions of 
the respondent Minister which appear <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> in 
petitioners' </span><span class="GramE"><span>reply, that</span></span><span> 
</span><span>"the preparation of the Family Study report from the home country 
on the prospective adopters is a requirement in this Memorandum of Agreement 
with 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Australia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 142).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court does not say nor do <span class="GramE">We</span> 
entertain a belief that the herein petitioners are in any way disqualified to be 
adopting parents in their home State or ordinary place of residence.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>What the Court simply wishes to express is that it would be more prudent 
and desirable to require that the petitioners herein submit themselves to a 
Family Study Report in their home country so that if a favorable report is 
thereafter submitted to the Ministry of Social Services and Development, then 
the corresponding travel certification should then forthwith issue, in 
implementation of the judgment of adoption already rendered.<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
step, if taken by petitioners will lead to the removal of the basic reason for 
the reluctance and apprehension of the public respondent Minister who, 
understandably, is concerned that the welfare of the adopted child might later 
be prejudiced â€” a possibility that may arise in the event that the latter's 
adoption is not sanctioned or recognized by Australia where petitioners are 
citizens and residents of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It may not be amiss to state that the petitioners, in their 
<span class="SpellE">Coment</span> to the motion for reconsideration, principally 
expound on the finality of the decision in the adoption case and that the 
working arrangement between the adoption authorities of 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Australia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
and the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
does not have the effect of law.<span>&nbsp; </span>But even as petitioners deplore 
the delay in the issuance of the certificate of clearance to travel, they, 
however, fail to tender an explanation or state any reason whatsoever for their 
apparent reluctance to submit themselves to a Family Case Study in their home 
State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">While the Court takes the view that the decision in the adoption 
case should not be disturbed and that all the technicalities that were raised 
against the adoption should yield to the ultimate end of promoting the best 
interest of the adopted child, the same guiding principle should be applied in 
the matter of the issuance of the travel clearance certificate.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This subsequent aspect of the adoption which was raised by respondent 
Minister was brought only lately to the Court's attention.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, 
it becomes relevant and important to extend consideration to the aforementioned 
Memorandum Agreement entered into in 1981 by our country and 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is well worth considering that the welfare of the adopted child 
can be truly protected if there is at least an assurance that the home State of 
the petitioners has undertaken a family case study concerning them.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As it would be but a simple thing for petitioners to submit to a family 
case study report, the Court finds it difficult to perceive the reason for 
petitioners' apparent adamant attitude in declining to do so.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
petitioners profess their desire to extend to their adopted child the warmth of 
a parent's love, the comforts of a caring home and the material provision he 
needs, their sincerity in this regard can best be manifested by laying aside any 
possible inconvenience on their part or searching for legal 
technicalities.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the referred Memorandum Agreement 
has the force and effect of law should be of least consideration to the 
petitioners if they are truly disposed to do their part to expedite the travel 
of their adopted child <span>to their country.<span>&nbsp; </span>The best solution 
would be for them to accept and submit themselves to a family case study 
</span>which should not be at all a difficult thing for them to do.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the same way that this Court took to task the Ministry of 
Social Services and Development for being, paradoxically, "overly concerned over 
its claimed exclusive prerogative to conduct the case study work instead of 
placing more importance on the possible prejudicial effects of its refusal on 
the welfare of the child", a similar rebuke may be fastened on the petitioners 
for their seemingly adamant attitude and reluctance to submit themselves to a 
family case study report, which if favorable to them would quickly remove the 
last reasonable obstacle for the issuance of the subject travel clearance 
certificate.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will banish the apprehension and any misgiving on 
the part of the local authorities concerned that the adopted child might be 
confronted with unexpected problems seriously prejudicial to his welfare, should 
the latter's adoption be not sanctioned or recognized by the State where 
petitioners reside and are citizens of.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE</span></b><span>, </span>and in the light of 
the facts and circumstances hereinabove discussed, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of our judgment in the instant case 
directing the issuance of the requisite travel clearance certificate <span>in 
</span>favor of the child, Adam Christopher <span class="SpellE">Bobanovic</span>, 
is hereby SUS<span>PENDED </span>and <span>DEFERRED </span>until after 
petitioners shall have submitted themselves to a Family Case Study in their home 
State of Victoria, Australia where they are said to be residing.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon furnishing herein respondent Minister of Social Services and 
Development with the corresponding official report on said Family Case Study and 
if such is favorable to the petitioners herein, then the requisite travel 
clearance certificate for the adopted child, Adam Christopher <span class="SpellE">Bobanovic</span>, should thus be issued by the office of the public 
respondent Minister as previously decreed.</p>
