				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This case is before us on automatic review, the death sentence 
having been imposed on all the accused except one who was condemned to life 
imprisonment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> All the defendants 
pleaded guilty upon arraignment, for which reason their counsel saw fit not to 
file appellants' brief<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the 
Solicitor General saw no need either to argue the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The only question we have to 
consider is whether or not the plea of guilty was knowingly made by the accused 
and validly accepted by the trial court.<br><br>The crime imputed to the accused 
was murder, allegedly committed by them in the municipal jail of San Jose, 
Occidental Mindoro, on January 29, 1979, when they ganged up on a fellow inmate, 
Romeo Roda, who was then asleep.&nbsp; While Canto, Soner and Canlas held the arms, 
legs and waist of the victim, Santos stabbed him several times in the body and 
Manalac strangled the helpless man with a nylon cord.&nbsp; The information alleged 
conspiracy among the accused and the aggravating circumstances of treachery, 
evident premeditation, nighttime and abuse of superior strength plus, in the 
case of Canto and Manalac, recidivism.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>At their arraignment on March 24, 
1980, all the accused, with the assistance and advice of counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> who had conferred with them earlier, pleaded guilty to the 
charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>The hearing, held on 
the same date, began as follows:</p>

<p align="justify">"COURT: </p>

<p align="justify">Atty. Sta. Romana, you ask them if they understood the legal 
consequence of their plea.&nbsp; Tell them that despite their plea of guilty, they 
may still be sentenced to the supreme penalty, that is death.&nbsp; (Atty. Sta. 
Romana conferred with the accused per instruction.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"ATTY. STA. ROMANA:</p>

<p align="justify">According to them, Your Honor, they fully understand the 
consequences of their plea and are willing to face it.</p></blockquote>

still change it to that of not guilty. </p></blockquote>

<p align="justify">They are persistent, Your Honor. </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"COURT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Re-arraign the accused, they may change their pleas.&nbsp; 
(Interpreter re-arraigning the accused by again reading to them the information 
and after which, the interpreter individually asked them for their respective 
pleas.) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"INTERPRETER:</p>

<p align="justify">All of the accused pleaded GUILTY, Your Honor.</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"COURT:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">In that case, let us suspend the proceedings in the meantime 
and we will resume at 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, to give the accused 
sufficient time to deliberate on the seriousness of the charge and on the grave 
consequences of their pleas.&nbsp; x x x.&nbsp; (Session resumed at 2:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon.)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"COURT:</p>

<p align="justify">Counsel, have you conferred with your clients?

<p align="justify">"ATTY. STA. ROMANA:</p>

<p align="justify">Yes, Your Honor, but the same, they still insist on their 
former pleas. </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">"COURT:</p>

<p align="justify">In that case, the Court has to place each of them on the 
witness stand, if only to assure itself that each of them really understands the 
meaning of their pleas. x x x.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Accordingly, each of the accused was questioned by the trial 
judge and testified in substantially the same manner as in the following 
interrogation of Alberto Manalac, the first to be called:</p>

<p align="justify">We cannot expect more concern for the defendants' rights than 
was manifested by the trial court in its cautious appraisal of their plea of 
guilty.&nbsp; We commend the meticulous questioning of all of the accused to 
ascertain that they really understood the information filed against them, that 
they had not been forced to confess their guilt and that they were aware of the 
possibility of their being sentenced to death.&nbsp; For his exemplary solicitude, 
Judge Teodoro K. Beltran has added luster to the Judiciary as the citadel of 
justice even for the basest criminals.<br><br>The Court is satisfied that the 
constitutional rights of the accused were fully protected and find no reason for 
annulling their conviction.&nbsp; The penalties were correctly computed after 
consideration of the evidence of conspiracy and the circumstances attending the 
commission of the crime as revealed in the extrajudicial confessions, and of the 
plea of guilty.&nbsp; However, the death sentence will have to be reduced to life 
imprisonment conformably to the new Constitution and the civil indemnity 
increased to P30,000.00 in accordance with the present doctrine.<br><br>The 
judgment of the court below as above modified is AFFIRMED, without any 
pronouncement as to costs.&nbsp; </p>
