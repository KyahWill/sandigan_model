BANK AND TRUST COMPANY, BANK OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS (SUR­VIVING BANK) AND
JACOBO C. CLAVE (AS PRESIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT), RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This <i>certiorari</i> case involves the issue of whe­ther
respondent Presidential Executive Assistant committed a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in confirming the abolition of
petitioner's position as a department manager in a bank and the payment to him
of separa­tion pay instead of reinstating him with backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Domingo F. Bondoc, who used to be an assistant of Jaime C.
Velasquez in the Ayala Securities Corporation (p. 116, Rollo), joined the
People's Bank and Trust Company on October 1, 1966 upon the recommendation of
Velasquez, a director, to Roman Azanza, the bank president (p. 35, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">He replaced Ariston Estrada, Jr. (p. 37, Rollo).  Bondoc was chosen by the bank' s board of
directors on February 21, 1967 as the first manager of the bank's department of
economic research and statistics which was organized in January, 1967 (Exh. 4
and 5).</p>

<p class="BODY">That department had only four employees: a stenogra­pher and
three clerks who were formerly employed in the comptroller's office, accounting
department and office of the corporate secretary (p. 117-118, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Every year, from 1968 to 1973, Bondoc was elected to the position
of department manager and assistant vice-president by the bank's board of
directors at its annual orga­nizational meeting (Exh. 1-B to 1-F).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 15, 1973, Bondoc reported in writing to Manuel Chuidian, a
bank director, certain anomalies com­mitted by the officers of the bank.  The Central Bank found that some officers of
the bank utilized its funds for their own interests.  Because of those anomalies, the Monetary Board suspended Benito
R. Araneta, a director and vice-president, and reprimanded the other officers
involved, namely, Seve­rino Coronation, Nicanor O. Corpus, Guillermo D.
Teodoro, Feldres G. San Pedro, Carlos Villaluz, Godofredo Galindez, Fernando
Macalanlay and Manuel P. Elepaño (pp. 6-8, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1973, the board of directors of <span style="">the </span>People' s Bank, in the course of
its deliberation on the bank' s projected merger with the Bank of the
Philippine Islands, resolved to abolish its department of economic research and
statistics which, as already noted, was headed by Bondoc (p. 35, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The board regarded the said department as a redun­dant unit whose
functions could be performed by other de­partments.  The Bank of P. I., like twenty-three other commercial banks, has
no such department (p. 117, Rollo).  Bondoc's four subordinates were absorbed by the accounting department.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bondoc was advised of the abolition of his department in the later
part of September, 1973.  He asked the
personnel manager to compute his separation pay.  Bondoc was told that his separation pay was equivalent to
seventy-five percent of his salary for every year of service.  It amounted to P10,481.25.  However, he was indebted to the bank in the
sum of P13, 493.33 under its car financing plan.  (p. 118, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Bondoc allegedly told the personnel manager that he would use his
separation pay to liquidate his debt and issue a check for P3,012.08 to cover
the balance of his debt.  He requested
the personnel manager to expedite the preparation of the bill of sale for the
Toyota car so that he could get the document on the following day.  But he did not show up that day.  (p. 118, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is relevant to state that the merger of the two banks was
effected in compliance with the Central Bank's require­ment that commercial
banks should increase their capital stock to a minimum of one hundred million
pesos through mergers and consolidations or other lawful means.  The merger was approved by the Monetary
Board and the Securi­ties and Exchange Commission.  The merger agreement was signed in January, 1974.  It was consummated on June 1, 1974.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 2, 1973, the People's Bank, pursuant to section 11 of
Presidential Decree No. 21 (creating the <u>ad</u> <u>hoc</u> National Labor
Relations Commission), applied with the Secretary of Labor for clearance to
terminate Bondoc's services effective on November 16 (p. 112, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On that same day, November 2, the bank president, Vicente C.
Aquino, formally notified Bondoc of the termi­nation of his services and of the
application for clearance.  Bondoc
received the notice on November 5 (p. 35, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">He lost no time in filing with the NLRC his opposi­tion to the
termination of his services.  He alleged
in his opposition that he was dismissed without cause (p. 114, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">As all efforts for the amicable settlement of the case were
fruitless, it was submitted for compulsory arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing, Bondoc tried to prove that the abolition of his
position was a reprisal for his aforemen­tioned exposure of some anomalies in
the bank which resulted in the suspension or reprimand by the Monetary Board of
cer­tain senior officers of the bank headed by Benito R. Araneta, a nephew of
J. Antonio Araneta, the chairman of the board (p. 48, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the NLRC arbitrator recommended to the Secretary
of Labor the denial of the application to ter­minate Bondoc' s employment and
ordered the People's Bank to reinstate him with backwages from November 16,
1973 and with allowances and other benefits guaranteed by law and without loss
of status and seniority rights (pp. 42-43, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the NLRC (Commissioners Castro, Borro­meo and Seno) in
its decision of January 21, 1975 reversed the decision of the arbitrator,
approved the clearance for Bondoc' s dismissal and ordered the People's Bank to
pay him seventy-five percent (75%) of his monthly salary for every year of
service in lieu of the one-half month salary for every year of service fixed in
the Termination Pay Law, Republic Act No. 1052, as amended by Republic Act No.
1787 (p. 45, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC adduced as reasons to justify the aboli­tion of Bondoc's
position (1) the fact that his position as manager being confidential in
character, the bank had the prerogative to terminate his employment anytime;
(2) Bondoc's department was no longer necessary to the efficient operation of
the bank in view of the merger; (3) the ma­nagement is not precluded from
undertaking a reorganiza­tion or making changes to meet the demands of the
present and (4) in case of mergers, departments or positions may be abolished
or new ones created, as the necessity for them requires (p. 44-45, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Bondoc appealed to the Secretary of Labor.  That high official in his resolution of
September 29, 1975 re­versed the NLRC' s decision on the grounds that the moti­vation
for the termination of Bondoc's services was not taken into account by the NLRC
and that the People' s Bank should not have abolished Bondoc's department without
prior clearance.  He denied the
application for clearance to dis­miss Bondoc.  (p. 50, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">He ordered the People' s Bank to reinstate Bondoc to his former
position or to any substantially equivalent position with backwages equivalent
to his salary for six months, it being understood that the Bank of the P. I.
has assumed all the liabilities and obligations of the People's Bank.  The Secretary denied the application for
clearance to dismiss Bondoc, (pp. 48-50, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">From that resolution, the Bank of the P. I., as successor of the
People' s Bank, appealed to the President of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the grounds relied upon in that appeal was that Bondoc was
convicted of bigamy, a crime involving moral turpitude (Criminal Case No. 7185,
Manila CFI, Exh. 1).  The Bank of the P.
I. cited Central Bank Cir­cular No. 356, which disqualifies a person convicted
of a crime involving moral turpitude from becoming an officer of a bank (pp.
213-4, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated May 17, 1976, Presidential Exe­cutive Assistant
Jacobo C. Clave set aside the decisions of the arbitrator and the Secretary and
confirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u> the NLRC' s decision (p. 54, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the President held that under the Termi­nation Pay Law
an employment without a definite period may be terminated with or without
cause, that the abolition of Bondoc' s position was a necessary incident of the
merger of the two banks and that his services were no longer indis­pensable to
them.  Hence, the clearance for his
removal was authorized.  (pp. 52-54,
Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">The review of the Presidential decision was sought by Bondoc in
the petition which he filed in this Court on May 27, 1976.  This is the <u>fifth</u> decision to be
rendered in his case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that under the peculiar or particular facts of this case
the termination of Bondoc's employment was lawful and justified and that no
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction was committed by
the Presidential Executive Assistant in affirming the NLRC' s decision
sustaining the termination of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bondoc was not employed for a fixed period.  He held his position of department manager
at the pleasure of the bank' s board of directors.  He occupied a managerial position and his stay therein depended
on his retention of the trust and confidence of the management and whether
there was any need for his services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although some vindictive motivation might have impelled the
abolition of his position, yet, it is undeniable that the bank's board of
directors possessed the power to remove him and to determine whether the
interest of the bank justified the existence of his department.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the old Termination Pay Law, it was held that in the
absence of <span style="">a </span>contract of
employment for a spe­cific period the employer has the right to dismiss his em­ployees
at anytime with or without just cause (De Dios vs. Bristol Laboratories
(Phils.), Inc., L-25530, January 29, 1974, 55 SCRA 349, 358; Jaguar
Transportation Co., Inc. vs. Cornista, L-32959, May 11, 1978, 83 SCRA 77).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that under Policy Instructions No. 8 of the
Secretary of Labor "the employer is not required to obtain a previous
written clearance to terminate managerial employees in order to enable him to
manage effectively".  (See Associated
Citizens Bank vs. Ople, L-4896, February 24, 1981.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner invokes the policy of the State to assure the
right of "workers" to security of tenure (Sec. 9, Art. II,
Constitution).</p>

<p class="BODY">That guarantee is an act of social justice.  When a person has no property, his job may
possibly be his only possession or means of livelihood.  Therefore, he should be protected against
any arbitrary and unjust deprivation of his job.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 280 of the Labor Code has construed security of tenure <span style="">as </span>referring to regular employment and
as meaning that <span style="">"the employer
shall </span>not terminate the <span style="">services
of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by" the Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As already noted above, the facts of this case do not warrant the
conclusion that Bondoc's right to security of tenure was oppressively
abridged.  He knew all along that his
tenure as a department manager rested in the dis­cretion of the bank's board of
directors and that at anytime his services might be dispensed with or his
position might be abolished.</p>

<p class="BODY">On equitable considerations, we hold that Bondoc should be paid
as separation pay his salary and allowances, if any, for seven months.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Presiden­tial
Executive Assistant is affirmed with the modification that the Bank of the P.
I. should pay to the petitioner separa­tion pay equivalent to his salary and
allowances (if any) for seven months.  No costs.</p>
