				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Three (3) separate Informations were filed against accused Claudio Teehankee, Jr. for the shooting of Roland John Chapman, Jussi Olavi Leino and Maureen Hultman.&nbsp; Initially, he was charged with:&nbsp; MURDER for the killing of ROLAND CHAPMAN, and two (2) FRUSTRATED MURDER for the shooting and wounding of JUSSI LEINO and MAUREEN HULTMAN.&nbsp; When Hultman died on October 17, 1991, during the course of the trial, the Information for Frustrated Murder against accused was amended to MURDER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The Information for Murder in Criminal Case No. 91-4605 thus reads:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of July, 1991, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said Claudio Teehankee, Jr. y Javier, armed with a handgun, with intent to kill and evident premeditation and by means of treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot with the said handgun Ronald John Chapman who was hit in the chest, thereby inflicting mortal wounds which directly caused the death of said Ronald John Chapman.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote><br>The Amended Information for Murder in Criminal Case No. 91-4606 reads:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of July, 1991, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the<span style="font-style: italic;"> said Claudio Teehankee, Jr. y Javier,</span> armed with a handgun, with intent to kill and evident premeditation, and by means of treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot <span style="font-style: italic;">with the said handgun</span> Maureen Navarro Hultman <span style="font-style: italic;">who was hit in the head, thereby inflicting mortal wounds which directly caused the death of said Maureen Hultman.</span><br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote><br>Finally, the Information for Frustrated Murder in Criminal Case No. 91-4607 reads:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about the 13th day of July, 1991, in the Municipality of Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, while armed with a handgun, with intent to kill, treachery and evident premeditation did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and shoot one Jussi Olavi Leino on the head, thereby inflicting gunshot wounds, which ordinarily would have caused the death of said Jussi Olavi Leino, thereby performing all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of murder as a consequence, but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of cause or causes independent of his will, that is, due to the timely and able medical assistance rendered to said Jussi Olavi Leino which prevented his death.<br><br>"Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br><br>In the two (2) Informations for frustrated murder initially filed against accused, bail was set at twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00) each.&nbsp; No bail was recommended for the murder of Roland John Chapman.&nbsp; A petition for bail was thus filed by accused.&nbsp; Hearing was set on August 9, 1991, while his arraignment was scheduled on August 14, 1991.<br><br>At the hearing of the petition for bail on August 9, 1991, the prosecution manifested that it would present the surviving victim, Jussi Leino, to testify on the killing of Chapman and on the circumstances resulting to the wounding of the witness himself and Hultman. Defense counsel Atty. Rodolfo Jimenez objected on the ground that the incident pending that day was hearing of the evidence on the petition for bail relative to the murder charge for the killing of Chapman only.&nbsp; He opined that Leino's testimony on the frustrated murder charges with respect to the wounding of Leino and Hultman would be irrelevant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Private prosecutor, Atty. Rogelio Vinluan, countered that time would be wasted if the testimony of Leino would be limited to the killing of Chapman considering that the crimes for which accused were charged involved only one continuing incident.&nbsp; He pleaded that Leino should be allowed to testify on all three (3) charges to obviate delay and the inconvenience of recalling him later to prove the two (2) frustrated murder charges.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>By way of accommodation, the defense suggested that if the prosecution wanted to present Leino to testify on all three (3) charges, it should wait until <b>after</b> the arraignment of accused on August 14, 1991.&nbsp; The defense pointed out that if accused did not file a petition for bail, the prosecution would still have to wait until after accused had been arraigned before it could present Leino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The private prosecutor agreed to defer the hearing on the petition for bail until after arraignment of accused on the condition that there shall be trial on the merits and, at the same time, hearing on the petition for bail.&nbsp; The defense counsel acceded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Upon arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty to the three (3) charges.&nbsp; The prosecution then started to adduce evidence relative to all three (3) cases.&nbsp; No objection was made by the defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>A replay of the facts will show that on July 12, 1991, Jussi Olavi Leino invited Roland Chapman, Maureen Hultman and other friends for a party at his house in Forbes Park, Makati. The party started at about 8:30 p.m. and ended at past midnight.&nbsp; They then proceeded to Roxy's, a pub where students of International School hang out.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> After an hour, they transferred to Vintage, another pub in Makati, where they stayed until past 3:00 a.m. of July 13, 1991. Their group returned to Roxy's to pick up a friend of Maureen, then went back to Leino's house to eat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>After a while, Maureen requested Leino to take her home at Campanilla Street, Dasmari√±as Village, Makati. Chapman tagged along.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> When they entered the village, Maureen asked Leino to stop along Mahogany Street, about a block away from her house in Campanilla Street.&nbsp; She wanted to walk the rest of the way for she did not like to create too much noise in going back to her house.&nbsp; She did not want her parents to know that she was going home that late.&nbsp; Leino offered to walk with her while Chapman stayed in the car and listened to the radio.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Leino and Maureen started walking on the sidewalk along Mahogany Street.&nbsp; When they reached the corner of Caballero and Mahogany Streets, <b>a light-colored Mitsubishi box-type Lancer car</b>, driven by accused Claudio Teehankee, Jr., came up from behind them and stopped on the middle of the road. Accused alighted from his car, approached them, and asked:&nbsp; "Who are you?&nbsp; (Show me your) I.D." Leino thought accused only wanted to check their identities.&nbsp; He reached into his pocket, took out his plastic wallet, and handed to accused his Asian Development Bank (ADB) I.D.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Accused did not bother to look at his I.D. as he just grabbed Leino's wallet and pocketed it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>Chapman saw the incident. All of a sudden, he manifested from behind Leino and inquired what was going on.&nbsp; He stepped down on the sidewalk and asked accused:&nbsp; "Why are you bothering us?" Accused pushed Chapman, dug into his shirt, pulled out a gun and fired at him.&nbsp; Chapman felt his upper body, staggered for a moment, and asked: "Why did you shoot me?" Chapman crumpled on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Leino knelt beside Chapman to assist him but accused ordered him to get up and leave Chapman alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Accused then turned his ire on Leino.&nbsp; He pointed the gun at him and asked:&nbsp; "Do you want trouble?" Leino said "no" and took a step backward.&nbsp; The shooting initially shocked Maureen.&nbsp; When she came to her senses, she became hysterical and started screaming for help.&nbsp; She repeatedly shouted:&nbsp; "Oh, my God, he's got a gun.&nbsp; He's gonna kill us.&nbsp; Will somebody help us?"<br><br>All the while, accused was pointing his gun to and from Leino to Maureen, warning the latter to shut up. Accused ordered Leino to sit down on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Leino obeyed and made no attempt to move away.&nbsp; Accused stood 2-3 meters away from him.&nbsp; He knew he could not run far without being shot by accused.<br><br>Maureen continued to be hysterical.&nbsp; She could not stay still. She strayed to the side of accused's car.&nbsp; Accused tried but failed to grab her.&nbsp; Maureen circled around accused's car, trying to put some distance between them.&nbsp; The short chase lasted for a minute or two.&nbsp; Eventually, accused caught Maureen and repeatedly enjoined her to shut up and sit down beside Leino.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Maureen finally sat beside Leino on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Two (2) meters away and directly in front of them stood accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> For a moment, accused turned his back from the two.&nbsp; He faced them again and shot Leino.&nbsp; Leino was hit on the upper jaw, fell backwards on the sidewalk, but did not lose consciousness.&nbsp; Leino heard another shot and saw Maureen fall beside him.&nbsp; He lifted his head to see what was happening and saw accused return to his car and drive away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Leino struggled to his knees and shouted for help.&nbsp; He noticed at least three (3) people looking on and standing outside their houses along Caballero Street.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> The three were:&nbsp; <b>DOMINGO FLORECE</b>, a private security guard hired by Stephen Roxas to secure his residence at #1357 Caballero Street, Dasmari√±as Village, Makati;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> <b>VICENTE MANGUBAT</b>, a stay-in driver of Margarita Canto, residing at #1352 Caballero Street, corner Mahogany Street, Dasmari√±as Village;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> and <b>AGRIPINO CADENAS</b>, a private security guard assigned at the house of Rey Dempsey, located at #1351 Caballero Street, corner Mahogany Street, Dasmari√±as Village.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Security guards Florece and Cadenas were then on duty at the house of their employer, while driver Mangubat was in his quarters, preparing to return to his own house.&nbsp; These three (3) eyewitnesses heard the first gunshot while at their respective posts.<br><br>Upon hearing the first shot, Florece went out to Caballero Street to see what was happening, while Mangubat and Cadenas peeped over the fence of their employer's house and looked out to Caballero Street.&nbsp; Each saw a man (Chapman) sprawled on the ground, another man (Leino) sitting on the sidewalk, a third man standing up and holding a gun and a woman (Hultman). They saw the gunman shoot Leino and Hultman and flee aboard his Lancer car.&nbsp; <b>However, because of Florece's distance from the scene of the crime,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><b> he was not able to discern the face of the gunman.&nbsp; He saw the control numbers of the gunman's car as 566.&nbsp; He described the getaway car as a box-type Lancer, its color somewhat white ("medyo puti").</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><b> Cadenas noticed in full the plate number of the getaway car and gave it as PDW 566.&nbsp; He described the car as silver metallic gray.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><b> Both Cadenas and Mangubat saw the gunman's face.&nbsp; They had a good look at him. Cadenas was then a mere four (4) meters away from the gunman's car,</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><b> while Mangubat was about twenty (20) meters away from the scene of the crime.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The three confirmed that the corner of Caballero and Mahogany Streets where the shooting took place was adequately illuminated by a Meralco lamppost at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>After the gunman sped away, Mangubat ran outside his employer's house and went near the scene of the crime. He noticed security guard Florece along Caballero Street.&nbsp; A man on a bike passed by and Mangubat requested him to report the shooting incident to the security officers of Dasmari√±as Village.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> Meanwhile, Florece returned to his post and narrated to his employer, Mrs. Helen Roxas, what he saw.&nbsp; Mrs. Roxas repaired to the crime scene while Florece noted the incident in his logbook (Exhibit "B").&nbsp; He also jotted down the license plate control number of the gunman's car as 566.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>The security guards of Dasmari√±as Village came after a few minutes.&nbsp; They rushed Leino and Maureen to the Makati Medical Center for treatment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup><br><br>The Makati police and agents of the NBI also came.&nbsp; Patrolman <b>JAMES BALDADO </b>of the Makati police, together with SPO3 <b>ALBERTO FERNANDEZ</b>, investigated the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> Their initial investigation disclosed that the gunman's car was a box-type Mitsubishi Lancer with plate control number 566.&nbsp; They checked the list of vehicles registered with the village Homeowners' Association and were able to track down two (2) Lancer cars bearing plate control number 566.&nbsp; One was registered in the name of <b>JOSE MONTA√ëO </b>of 1823 Santan Street, Dasmari√±as Village, with plate number PKX 566, and another was traced to accused <b>CLAUDIO TEEHANKEE, JR.</b>, of 1339 Caballero Street, Dasmari√±as Village, with plate number PDW 566.<br><br><b>SALVADOR RANIN</b>, Chief of the Special Operations Group (SOG) of the NBI, was also tasked by then NBI Director Alfredo Lim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> to head a team to investigate the shooting. Ranin's team immediately proceeded to the house of Jose Monta√±o<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> where they found ahead of them the Makati police and operatives of the Constabulary Highway Patrol.&nbsp; Ranin tried to verify from Mrs. Monta√±o whether the white Lancer car registered in the name of Mr. Monta√±o and bearing plate number 566 was the gunman's car.&nbsp; Mrs. Monta√±o denied and declared they had already sold the car to Salda√±a Enterprises. She averred the car was being used by one Ben Conti, a comptroller in said company, who resides in Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; Mrs. Monta√±o called up her husband and informed him about the investigation.&nbsp; She also called up Conti and asked him to bring the car to the house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br><br>Jose Monta√±o came around noon. Conti followed with the white Lancer car.&nbsp; Ranin brought them to the NBI office for investigation, together with the Lancer car.&nbsp; At the NBI, Ranin inquired from Monta√±o the whereabouts of his car on July 12 and 13, 1991.&nbsp; Monta√±o informed him that the car was at the residence of his employee, Ben Conti, at E. Rodriguez Street, Cubao, Quezon City, the night of July 12, 1991.&nbsp; In the morning of July 13, 1991, Conti drove the car to their office at Salda√±a Enterprises.&nbsp; Conti confirmed this information.&nbsp; Ranin received the same confirmation from two (2) NBI agents who made a countercheck of the allegation.&nbsp; Upon Ranin's request, Monta√±o left his car at the NBI parking lot pending identification by possible witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup><br><br>On July 14, 1991, a team of NBI agents conducted an on-the-spot investigation and neighborhood inquiry of the shooting incident.&nbsp; They interviewed Domingo Florece and asked him to report to their office the next day for further investigation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> They also interviewed Agripino Cadenas who was reluctant to divulge any information and even denied having witnessed the incident.&nbsp; Sensing his reluctance, they returned to Cadenas' post at Dasmari√±as Village that night and served him a subpoena, inviting him to appear at the NBI office for investigation the next day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> The NBI agents also talked with <b>Armenia Asliami</b>, an Egyptian national residing at #1350 Caballero Street, Dasmari√±as Village, near the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Asliami informed the agents that the gunman's car was not white but light gray. A foreign national, Asliami was afraid and refused to give a statement about the incident.&nbsp; The agents exerted every effort to convince Asliami to cooperate, assuring her of their protection.&nbsp; Ranin even asked a representative of the Egyptian embassy to coax Asliami to cooperate.&nbsp; They failed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>On July 15, 1991, Florece and Cadenas appeared at the NBI office as summoned.&nbsp; Florece readily executed a sworn statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> Cadenas, however, continued to feign ignorance and bridled his knowledge of the incident.&nbsp; He was lengthily interviewed.&nbsp; At around 2:00 p.m., the NBI agents informed SOG Chief Ranin that Cadenas was still withholding information from them.&nbsp; Ranin talked to Cadenas in his office.&nbsp; Cadenas confided to Ranin his fear to get involved in the case. He was apprehensive that the gunman would harass or harm him or his family.&nbsp; After Ranin assured him of NBI protection, Cadenas relented.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br><br>The next day, July 16, 1991, Cadenas gave a full disclosure to Ranin.&nbsp; He described the gunman's car as a box-type Lancer with plate number PDW 566. He was brought to the NBI parking lot where Monta√±o's white Lancer car was parked to identify the gunman's car. Ranin asked Cadenas if Monta√±o's was the gunman's car.&nbsp; Cadenas replied that its color was different.&nbsp; Ranin directed him to look around the cars in the parking lot and to point the color that most resembled the color of the gunman's car.&nbsp; He pointed to a light gray car.&nbsp; Ranin told him that the color of the car he pointed to was not white but light gray.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup><br><br>Ranin then asked Cadenas if he could identify the gunman.&nbsp; Cadenas replied in the affirmative.&nbsp; Ranin led Cadenas to his office and showed him ten (10) pictures of different men (Exhibits "CC-1" to "CC-10) taken from the NBI files.&nbsp; One of the pictures belonged to accused Claudio Teehankee, Jr. Cadenas studied the pictures, picked accused's picture (Exhibit "CC-7"), and identified him as the gunman. Cadenas wrote his name and the date at the back of said picture.&nbsp; Atty. Alex Tenerife of the NBI then took down Cadenas' statement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>Ranin sent his agents and the witnesses to the Makati Regional Trial Court to apply for a search warrant. After a searching examination of the witnesses, <b>Judge Rebecca Salvador </b>issued a search warrant (Exhibit "RR"), authorizing the NBI to search and seize the silver metallic gray, 1983 Mitsubishi Lancer car owned by accused, bearing plate number PDW 566. Ranin and his agents drove to accused's house at #1339 Caballero Street, Dasmari√±as Village, to implement the warrant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><br>At accused's house, Ranin informed <b>Mrs. Pilar Teehankee</b>, mother of accused, of their search warrant. Ranin also told Mrs. Teehankee that they had orders from Director Lim to invite accused to the NBI office for investigation.&nbsp; Mrs. Teehankee informed them that accused was not in the house at that time.&nbsp; She excused herself, went to the kitchen and called up someone on the phone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup><br><br>In the meantime, Ranin and his men slipped to the Teehankee garage and secured accused's car.&nbsp; After a while, Mrs. Teehankee joined them. Ranin asked her for the car keys but she told him that the keys were with accused.&nbsp; Upon Ranin's request, Mrs. Teehankee got in touch with accused on the phone.&nbsp; Ranin conversed with accused and invited him to the NBI for investigation.&nbsp; Accused assured Ranin that he would report to the NBI later that day.&nbsp; The agents then towed the car of accused to the NBI office.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup><br><br>At around 9:00 p.m., accused's brother, <b>Raul Teehankee</b>, arrived at the NBI office and waited for accused.&nbsp; Accused came, escorted by three (3) Makati policemen, after an hour.&nbsp; He informed them that he just came from the Makati police station where he was also investigated.&nbsp; He told Lim that he has given a statement to the Makati police and was brought to the PC Crime Laboratory for paraffin test.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>Accused's NBI investigation started.&nbsp; Lim asked accused of the whereabouts of his Lancer car at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; Accused claimed that his car was involved in an accident a few weeks back and was no longer functioning.&nbsp; The car had been parked in his mother's house at Dasmari√±as Village since then.&nbsp; Due to the lateness of the evening, the group decided to continue the investigation the following day.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>The next day, July 17, 1991, after breakfast at the Manila Hotel, Lim pressed accused on what really happened at Dasmari√±as Village.&nbsp; Accused said he did not see anything.&nbsp; Lim apprised accused that he would be confronted with some eyewitnesses. Accused sank into silence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>Lim directed Ranin to prepare a lineup at his office.&nbsp; Accused was requested to join the lineup composed of seven (7) men and he acceded. Cadenas was called from an adjoining room<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> and Ranin asked him to identify the gunman from the lineup.&nbsp; Forthwith, Cadenas pointed to accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup> Accused merely stared at Cadenas.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup><br><br>On the same day, then <b>Asst. Director Epimaco Velasco</b>, Ranin and two (2) other agents brought accused to Forbes Park for further identification by the surviving victim, Jussi Leino. Leino has just been discharged from the hospital the day before. Since Leino's parents were worried about his safety, they requested the NBI to conduct the identification of the gunman in Forbes Park where the Leinos also reside.&nbsp; The NBI agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup><br><br>House security agents from the U.S. embassy fetched Leino at his house and escorted him and his father to a vacant house in Forbes Park, along Narra Avenue.&nbsp; After a couple of minutes, Leino was brought out of the house and placed in a car with slightly tinted windows.&nbsp; The car was parked about five (5) meters away from the house. Inside the car with Leino was his father, NBI-SOG Chief Salvador Ranin and a driver.&nbsp; Leino was instructed to look at the men who would be coming out of the house and identify the gunman from the lineup.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup><br><br>A group of five to six men (including accused) then came out of the unoccupied house, into the street, in a line-up.&nbsp; Leino noticed that one of them was wearing sunglasses.&nbsp; Since Leino could not yet speak at that time due to the extensive injury on his tongue, he wrote down on a piece of paper a request for one of the men in the lineup to remove his sunglasses.&nbsp; Leino handed this written request to his father.&nbsp; The men in the lineup were herded back inside the house.&nbsp; After a couple of minutes, they again stepped out and none was wearing sunglasses.&nbsp; From the lineup, Leino identified accused as the gunman.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>The agents brought back accused to the NBI.&nbsp; They prepared and referred the cases of murder and double frustrated murder against accused to the Department of Justice for appropriate action.&nbsp; At the inquest, <b>Fiscal Dennis Villa-Ignacio </b>did not recommend bail insofar as the murder charge was concerned.&nbsp; Hence, accused was detained at the NBI.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup><br><br>The shooting incident was also investigated by the Makati Police.&nbsp; Pat. Baldado went to see security guard Vicente Mangubat at his post, at the residence of his employer in Dasmari√±as Village.&nbsp; Baldado interviewed Mangubat and invited him to the Makati police station where his statement (Exhibit "D") was taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup><br><br>The next day, July 16, 1991, at about 8:30 a.m., Pat. Baldado fetched Mangubat from his house and brought him to the Makati police station.&nbsp; At the station, Baldado told him to wait for a man who would be coming and see if the person was the gunman.&nbsp; Mangubat was posted at the top of the stairs at the second floor of the station.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup><br><br>After a couple of hours, accused, came with Makati police Major Lovete.&nbsp; He ascended the stairs, passed by Mangubat and proceeded to Major Lovete's office at the second floor.&nbsp; While accused was going up the stairs, Pat. Baldado inquired from Mangubat if accused was the gunman.&nbsp; Mangubat initially declined to identify accused, saying that he wanted to see the man again to be sure.&nbsp; He also confided to Pat. Baldado that he was nervous and afraid for accused was accompanied by a police Major.&nbsp; When accused came out from Major Lovete's office, Pat. Baldado again asked Mangubat if accused was the gunman.&nbsp; Mangubat nodded his head in response.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup> Accused, together with Major Lovete and Pat. Baldado, boarded a Mercedes Benz and left.&nbsp; Mangubat was brought back to his post at Dasmari√±as Village by other Makati policemen.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[61]</sup><br><br>Two (2) days later, Pat. Baldado visited Mangubat at his employer's house and asked him again if accused was really the gunman.&nbsp; Once more, Mangubat answered in the affirmative.&nbsp; Pat. Baldado told Mangubat that he would no longer ask him to sign a statement which he (Baldado) earlier prepared (Exhibit "HHH").<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[62]</sup> Baldado then left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup><br><br>In the afternoon of July 23, 1991, Mangubat was also questioned by the NBI agents.&nbsp; Director Lim asked Mangubat if he could recognize the gunman. Mangubat said he could.&nbsp; Mangubat was shown twelve (12) pictures (Exhibits "E" to "E-11) of different men and was asked to identify the gunman from them. He chose one picture (Exhibit "E-10"), that of accused, and identified him as the gunman.&nbsp; Mangubat signed at the back of said picture.&nbsp; Mangubat's statement was taken.&nbsp; He was asked to return to the NBI the next day to make a personal identification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[64]</sup><br><br>When Mangubat returned, a lineup was prepared in Lim's office in the presence of the media.&nbsp; At that time, accused's counsels, <b>Attys.

In resolving the admissibility of and relying on out-of-court identification of suspects, courts have adopted the <b>totality of circumstances test</b> where they consider the following factors, <i>viz</i>:&nbsp; (1) the witness' opportunity to view the criminal at the time of the crime; (2) the witness' degree of attention at that time; (3) the accuracy of any prior description given by the witness; (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the identification; (5) the length of time between the crime and the identification; and, (6) the suggestiveness of the identification procedure.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[143]</sup><br><br>Using the totality of circumstances test, we hold that the alleged irregularities cited by appellant did not result in his misidentification nor was he denied due process.&nbsp;

More devastating was the emotional strain that distressed Leino.&nbsp; His parents were in Europe for a vacation at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; Only a neighbor attended to him at the hospital. It took two (2) days for his father to come and comfort by his bedside.&nbsp; Leino had trouble sleeping in peace at night.&nbsp; The traumatic event woke him up in the middle of the night.
