				<H3>GERVACIO D. VERCELES, PETITIONER, VS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case comes to us with a sentimental touch, this being a suit
between a grandmother, more than eighty years old when she filed her petition
in 1975, and her grandchildren.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner assails the Decision of the respondent Judge<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
which granted the private respondent's petition for the surrender of the
"Owner's Duplicate Copy" of Transfer Certificate of Title (T.C.T.,
for short) No. 78685 to the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
to enable the petitioner in the trial court and private respondent herein (the
grandmother) to register whatever document she desires pertaining to the land
embraced therein.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner avers that on <st1:date year="1944" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1944</st1:date>, his <span class="GramE">grandmother</span>,
the private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Ladines</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, and her husband executed a Deed of
Donation <span class="SpellE"><b>propter</b></span><b> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></b>
of 1,064 square meters of residential land, situated in the <span class="SpellE"><b>poblacion</b></span>
of <span class="SpellE">Binalonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>,
in favor of their son, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verceles</span>
and his bride, <span class="SpellE">Donata</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>
Rodriguez (now both deceased).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
only on April 17, 1970, however, that the herein petitioner and his four
brothers (surviving children of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verceles</span> and <span class="SpellE">Donata</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span> Rodriguez) were able to register an adverse claim
for the area covered by the said Deed of Donation and had the same annotated in
the Memorandum of Encumbrances of T.C.T. No. 78685.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner claims that after the execution of the Deed of
Donation <span class="SpellE"><b>propter</b></span><b> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></b>,
the private respondent-donor disposed of several portions of the parcel of land
covered by T.C.T. No. 78685.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of
these dispositions were annotated in the Memorandum of Encumbrances of the
title.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1974</st1:date>,
the private respondent filed the petition adverted to earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Grandmother <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
averred in her petition before the respondent court that she is the registered
owner of the parcel of land described in T.C.T. No. 78685; that the
"Owner's Duplicate Copy" is in, the possession of the petitioner, who
refuses to surrender the same despite several demands; and that she needs the
certificate of title very badly for registration purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 22, 1974, the herein petitioner, grandson <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>, filed in the respondent court his opposition on
the grounds that an area of 1,064 square meters included in T.C.T. No. 78685
had been conveyed by grandmother <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> to his
parents, <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Verceles</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Donata</span> <span class="SpellE">Antipaz</span>
Rodriguez, by way of donation <span class="SpellE"><b>propter</b></span><b> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></b>; that the petitioner and his four brothers
acquired the same area by inheritance and/or quitclaim from their deceased
parents; that the "Owner's Duplicate Copy" was given to him (the
Petitioner) by his father before the latter's death in February, 1974; that
there is a pending civil case regarding ownership of the land before the same
trial court; and that the private respondent is no longer the owner of the
Parcel of land described in T.C.T. No. 78685 due to the series of conveyances
and transfers she had already made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place>
title shows that the parcel of land registered has a total area of 1,728 square
meters only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniable that the
petitioner and his four brothers have been in continuous adverse exclusive
possession and enjoyment of the donated portion of 1,064 square meters as
owners and have been paying the taxes thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1974</st1:date>,
the respondent Judge issued the questioned Order, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court, finding the petition to be in order, hereby
orders the respondent to surrender the owner's duplicate copy of Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 78685 within ten (10) days from receipt hereof to the
Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to enable the
petitioner to register whatever document she desires pertaining to the land
embraced therein.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The decision was primarily anchored on
the trial court's skepticism that the disputed land in question, subject matter
of the donation <span class="SpellE"><b>propter</b></span><b> <span class="SpellE">nuptias</span></b>,
is part of the area described in T.C.T. No. 78685.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1974</st1:date>,
the herein petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1974</st1:date>, an Opposition thereto was filed by the private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="12">December 10, 1974</st1:date>, the respondent Judge denied
the Motion for Reconsideration for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Petition, which we have
considered as a special civil action in our Resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Petition lacks merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent trial Judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion in
rendering the decision now being questioned in these proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">T.C.T. No. 78685 is still in the name of grandmother <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>, the private respondent herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The T.C.T. being in her name, she is the
owner of the "Owner's Duplicate Copy," and, therefore, entitled to
hold and keep the document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Precisely,
that is why it is denominated "Owner's Duplicate Copy." The claim or
interest of the petitioner over a portion of the real property described in the
certificate of title does not affect at all the private respondent's right of
possession of the "Owner's Duplicate Copy" of the T.C.T. yet in her
name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's adverse claim is
duly annotated in the Memorandum of Encumbrances of the T.C.T.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is sufficient protection for the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His adverse claim does not
grant him the right to the physical possession of the Owner's Duplicate
Copy." Unless and until T.C.T. No. 78685 has been duly cancelled by the
Register of Deeds for the Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, the
physical possession of the "Owner's Duplicate Copy" thereof pertains
to the private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, that is
not what the assailed decision mandates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision orders the delivery by the petitioner of the "Owner's
Duplicate Copy" of T.C.T. No. 78685 "to the Register of Deeds for the
Province of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> to enable the private
respondent to register whatever document she desires pertaining to the land
embraced therein." The delivery should be to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Decision dated <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1974</st1:date>, is hereby MODIFIED to the
effect that the petitioner must deliver the "Owner's Duplicate Copy"
of T.C.T. No. 78685 to the private respondent or her duly authorized
representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This DECISION IS IMMEDIATELY
EXECUTORY.</p>
