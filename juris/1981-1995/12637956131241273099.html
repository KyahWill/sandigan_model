<p>This is an appeal by ROMULO Cerelegia who was convicted of violating Section 
4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972) as amended, 
for selling dried marijuana leaves. He was sentenced by the Regional Trial Court 
of Bohol (Tagbilaran City) on September 3, 1985, to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, 
to pay a fine of P20,000.00 and the costs, with the recommendation, considering 
his age of 22 and being a Sophomore college student at the University of Bohol, 
that he be granted executive clemency after service of part of the penalty. </p>
<p>The Information alleges: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That, on or about the 10<sup>th</sup> day of October 1984, in the City of 
Tagbilaran, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, 
the above-named accused, with the deliberate and criminal intent to gain and 
without any lawful purpose, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, 
feloniously and knowingly push, deal in, sell for profit, deliver and give away 
one (1) matchbox of dried marijuana leaves for and in consideration of the sum 
of FIFTEEN PESOS (P15.00), Philippine Currency, the accused knowing pretty well 
that the abovementioned products are the source of prohibited drugs and that he 
has no authority, permit or license to sell the same, to the damage and 
prejudice of the Republic of the Philippines."</p></blockquote>
<p>On arraignment, ROMULO entered a negative plea.</p>
<p>During the trial the prosecution presented the testimonies of Myrna Areola, 
Forensic Chemist of the PC Crime Laboratory, Regional Unit; M/Sgt. Alejandro 
Biñan, Pat. Alberto Puagang and T/Sgt. Renato Remetiera, of the PC Narcotics 
Command (NARCOM) at Bohol. Briefly, they testified to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Around 9:00 a.m. on October 9, 1984, a civilian informant named Butch 
Sarmiento went to the City Hall of Tagbilaran City and there revealed to the 
personnel of the Narcotics Command (NARCOM) Detachment the activities of one 
Romulo Cerelegia who was selling marijuana at the vicinity of the University of 
Bohol in that city. The NARCOM personnel to whom the information was given were 
T/Sgt. Renato Remetiera, the detachment commander, Pat. Alberto Puagang, CIC 
Teodosio Rosaroso, and M/Sgt. Alejandro Biñan. Immediately, the four NARCOM 
personnel and their informant devised a plan to entrap Cerelegia (tsn., pp. 
9-10, February 19, 1985).</p>
<p>"They marked three (3) five (5) pesos bills by having T/Sgt. Remetiera 
initial the seals thereon (Exhibit C), at the same time listing the serial 
numbers thereof. The following day, around 9:45 a.m., three (3) of the NARCOM 
personnel met Butch Sarmiento, frisked him, and finding that he had no marijuana 
in his possession, gave him the three (3) marked five (5) peso bills which he 
would use to buy marijuana from Cerelegia. Proceeding to the vicinity of the 
University of Bohol, the informant stationed himself at the gate thereof 
fronting Maria Clara Street, while M/Sgt. Biñan and Pat. Puagang posted 
themselves across that street at a place known as the Orapa Store. CIC Rosaroso 
stood watch at the gate of the University of Bohol High School (tsn., pp. 11-13, 
February 19, 1985).</p>
<p>"Shortly, Romulo Cerelegia approached Butch Sarmiento and after a brief 
exchange of words, they crossed Maria Clara Street and proceeded to a small 
alley beside the Orapa Store. M/Sgt. Binan and Pat. Puagang followed and from a 
distance of two (2) to three (3) meters, heard Cerelegia utter to Sarmiento: 'Do 
you have already the money?' The latter replied: 'Yes I have already the money' 
and pulled out the three (3) marked P5.00 bills. Cerelegia on his part produced 
a matchbox and handed it over to Sarmiento in exchange for the three (3) marked 
P5.00 bills. At that point, M/Sgt. Biñan and Pat. Puagang closed in and after 
announcing themselves as NARCOM agents, apprehended Cerelegia (tsn., pp. 11-12, 
February 19, 1985).</p>
<p>"M/Sgt. Biñan searched Cerelegia and recovered the three (3) marked P5.00 
bills from the right front pocket of his <em>maong</em> pants. He was then 
brought to the NARCOM headquarters where the contents of the matchbox handed 
over by him to Sarmiento were subjected to a field test and found to be dried 
marijuana leaves (tsn., p. 14, February 19, 1986; Exhibit D).</p>
<p>"Subsequently, the said contents were turned over to the PC Crime Laboratory 
in Cebu City and after tests, were found to be positive for marijuana (tsn., pp. 
1-9; February 19, 1985; Exhibit A)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p></blockquote>
<p>In his defense, ROMULO, 22 years old, single, and a sophomore college student 
at the University of Bohol, claimed that he was framed-up by the NARCOM using 
Butch Sarmiento as intermediary. ROMULO's version was that around 10:30 a.m. of 
October 10, 1984, after his class, he met Butch standing alone near the 
University gate. Butch approached him and invited him to go somewhere. He knew 
Butch to be a civilian informer of the NARCOM since Butch told him so, and they 
used to see each other at the PC Barracks at Camp Dagohoy, where ROMULO was 
staying as a protegé of one Major Narzal Ermac.</p>
<p>According to ROMULO, Butch placed an arm around his shoulder and showed him 
(ROMULO) a matchbox containing dried crumpled leaves, which Butch himself 
opened. ROMULO did not know what kind of leaves they were. He left Butch near 
the gate, but after walking a short distance he was held on the neck by a man 
who identified himself as a PC soldier. Butch ran away and was chased by another 
person. Butch threw the matchbox and his wallet at the place where ROMULO was 
held, and these were picked up by the PC officer holding him.</p>
<p>Continuing, ROMULO said that he was brought to the NARCOM Office at 
Tagbilaran City Hall where he was investigated, but they did not ask him about 
the matchbox nor the wallet. During the investigation, which lasted for 10 
minutes, he was maltreated by the soldiers who pushed his head against the 
cement wall and hit his head with a book. He was not allowed to contact his 
parents nor was his request for a lawyer granted. Butch, who arrived later, was 
taken to a separate room. He (ROMULO) was thereafter brought before the Fiscal 
for preliminary investigation.</p>
<p>ROMULO's benefactor, Major Narzal Ermac, vouched for the former's good 
character and testified that he knew ROMULO since the latter's birth. ROMULO, he 
said, is the youngest son of his tenant and had been living in his house at Camp 
Dagohoy for six years; that he had been spending for ROMULO's education since 
high school; that ROMULO neither smokes, nor drinks liquor, nor does he go out 
with "barkada", and has no criminal record. The documentary evidence likewise 
discloses that Major Ermac pleaded for compassion for ROMULO with the NARCOM 
Detachment Commander, Tagbilaran City (Exhibit "G"), but without success.</p>
<p>Also in evidence is a formal communication from ROMULO's lawyer addressed to 
the City Fiscal requesting that ROMULO be "allowed to plead" to the lesser 
offense of Illegal Possession of Prohibited Drug, as desired by him (ROMULO). 
Upon indorsement to the Narcotics Regional Unit, Cebu City, however, the 
Commanding Officer objected on the ground that the "accused claimed his 
contraband was pilfered from a legitimate depository and which act doubly 
aggravate his calling" (Exhibit "F").</p>
<p>This appeal impugns the credibility of prosecution witnesses, and stresses 
the supposed good moral character of the accused.</p>
<p>Parenthetically, it may be stated that the arresting officers herein, namely, 
Sgts. Biñan, Rosaroso and Romitera were the same arresting officers of the 
accused in People vs. Ale<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>, who was 
acquitted by this Court. Unlike in that case, however, the "buy and bust" 
operation herein was better planned and conducted. The confidential informant 
was frisked first and found to have no contraband on his person. The 5 peso 
bills were also marked before they were given to him. The peace officers 
positioned themselves near enough to keep ROMULO and Butch in sight. They 
actually saw ROMULO pull out the matchbox from his pocket and hand it to Butch, 
who, in return gave the marked bills to ROMULO (Exhibits "C", "C-1", "C-2"). 
Being also within hearing distance, they heard the conversation between the two. 
Thus, the testimonies of M/Sgt. Alejandro Biñan and Pat. Alberto Puagang are 
clear and credible eyewitness reports. Following is a portion of M/Sgt. Biñan's 
testimony:</p>

<p>The arresting officers had no motive, and no motive has been attributed to 
them by ROMULO, as to why he would be falsely accused of a serious offense. From 
the attendant circumstances it is apparent that, as PC/NARCOM Officers, they 
were intent on prosecuting violators of the law. This is specially evident in 
the circumstance that despite the plea for the quashal of the case by Police 
Major Narzal Ermac of the PC-INP, formerly assigned as Deputy Police 
Superintendent of Bohol, M/Sgt. Remetiera of the NARCOM was determined to 
prosecute the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> P/Major Ermac even 
testified that he did not readily believe ROMULO's claim that he did not commit 
the crime "because PC officials to me are not foolish to arrest persons without 
any violation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> M/Sgt. Remetiera also 
categorically declared that there was no reason to frame-up ROMULO.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> ROMULO could give no reason either why he 
should be framed up by the NARCOM with whom he had no misunderstanding 
whatsoever.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p>ROMULO's further claim that it was Butch Sarmiento who had framed him up 
because at one instance he had caught Butch inside the living quarters of Major 
Ermac and reported the matter to the latter who scolded Butch, is not a 
sufficient motive, assuming the same really happened, for the latter to 
incriminate him falsely besides the fact that Major Ermac testified that he did 
not know Butch Sarmiento and that he just came to know of him when M/Sgt. 
Remetiera mentioned his name.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p>ROMULO's declaration that Butch informed him that he (Butch) was a PC 
informer does not invite credence for if he really did, there would have been no 
need to report his presence in Major Ermac's quarters. Neither can we lend 
credence to ROMULO's claim that the matchbox and the wallet were merely thrown 
in his direction by Butch considering Sgt. Biñan’s testimony that he retrieved 
the marked P5 bills from the right front pocket of ROMULO's "maong" pants, which 
the defense never rebutted.</p>
<p>That Butch was not presented as a witness is not fatal to the prosecution's 
evidence, since his testimony would be merely corroborative and cumulative. 
Besides, if as ROMULO claims he personally knew Butch and where he resided,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the defense could have asked that he be 
subpoenaed, a constitutional right given an accused to have compulsory process 
to secure the attendance of witnesses in his behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In fact, the Trial Court advised the 
defense counsel to make a formal request with the Clerk of Court for the 
issuance of a subpoena for Butch<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> but 
apparently, the defense counsel had second thoughts about it since the record 
does not show that Butch was subpoenaed, and the defense rested its case without 
calling Butch to testify.</p>
<p>Now, for the determination of the influence of good character as evidence. It 
is true that the good moral character of an accused having reference to the 
moral trait involved in the offense charged may be proven by him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> But an accused is not entitled to an 
acquittal simply because of his previous good moral character and exemplary 
conduct if the Court believes he is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime 
charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> The affirmance or reversal 
of his conviction must be resolved on the basic issue of whether the prosecution 
had discharged its duty of proving his guilt beyond peradventure of doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> In the case at bar, evidence of the crime 
being clear and convincing, evidence of good character will not prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></p>
<p>Besides, as stated previously, there is evidence showing that ROMULO himself 
had "claimed" he had taken the marijuana from a "legitimate depository", hence, 
the objection of the PC Commander to allowing a reduction of the charge to a 
lesser offense (Exhibit "F"). The "pilfering" is corroborated by no less than 
Major Ermac, who, in pleading for compassion on ROMULO's behalf to the NARCOM, 
mentioned "that the prohibited Indian hemp involved in this case was merely a 
sample kept inside the room of P/Lt. Dorigo and Lt. Berba" (Exhibit "G"). The 
"taking" of the marijuana and its subsequent sale for P15.00 immediately 
shatters the defense of good moral character stressed in seeking ROMULO's 
acquittal.</p>
<p>The alleged denial of the right to counsel during custodial investigation, 
underscored by the defense, is not a material issue in this case since no 
extrajudicial statement was taken from the accused besides the fact that in 
determining the culpability of the accused the Court <em>a quo</em> relied on 
the eyewitness testimonies of the apprehending officers and not on any 
extrajudicial statement.</p>
<p>Like the Trial Court, however, considering that ROMULO is in the prime of his
