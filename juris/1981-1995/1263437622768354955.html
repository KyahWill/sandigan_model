				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Constable Moreno L. Tumimpad and co-accused Constable
Ruel C. Prieto were charged with the crime of rape committed against a 15-year
old Mongoloid child in a complaint dated on May 24, 1991, signed by her mother,
Mrs. Pastora L. Salcedo, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>That during the period between the last week of March 1989 and the
first week of April 1989, in Barangay Lower Lamac, Oroquieta City, Philippines,
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused did then
and there, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have (sic) carnal knowledge with
Sandra Salcedo, complainant's daughter, a woman who is a mongoloid and so weak
of mind and in intellect as to be capable of giving rational and legal consent.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty to the
crime charged and due trial ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as established by evidence are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sandra Salcedo at the time of the incident was a 15-year old
Mongoloid and daughter of Lt. Col. Teofisto Salcedo and Pastora Salcedo.  She had a mind of a five-year old child, who
still needed to be fed and dressed up.  Her vocabulary was limited and most of the time she expressed herself by
motions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Col. Teofisto Salcedo was then Provincial Commander of Misamis
Occidental.  Four security men were
assigned to him, two of whom were accused Constable Ruel Prieto and
accused-appellant Moreno Tumimpad.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Salcedo family, composed of Col. Salcedo, his wife Pastora,
his son Alexander and wife and daughter Sandra, lived in a two-storey officers'
quarters inside Camp Lucas Naranjo, Provincial Headquarters, in Oroquieta
City.  The upper storey of the house was
occupied by Col. Salcedo, his wife and Sandra while the lower storey had two
(2) rooms, one of which was occupied by the four security men and the other by
Alexander Salcedo and his wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on August 7, 1989, when Sandra complained of
constipation.  Mrs. Salcedo then brought
her to a doctor in Oroquieta City for a checkup.  Medication was given to Sandra but her condition did not
improve.  Sandra became irritable and
moody.  She felt sick and unhappy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, August 8, 1989, Sandra saw Moreno Tumimpad
coming out from the kitchen and told her mother, "Mama, patayin mo 'yan,
bastos."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Pastora Salcedo, worried of her daughter's condition,
brought her to Regina Hospital.  Sandra
was able to relieve herself the following day but still remained moody and
irritable.  She refused to take a bath
in spite of scoldings from her mother.  She did not want to eat and whenever she did, she would vomit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sandra was brought to a doctor in Oroquieta City for a second
checkup.  Dr. Conol, the examining
physician, ordered a urinalysis.  Jose
C. Lim, a Medical Technologist, conducted the urinalysis.  The result revealed that Sandra was
pregnant.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Mrs. Pastora Salcedo could not believe that her daughter was pregnant and so
she brought Sandra to Madonna and Child Hospital in Cagayan de Oro City.  Dr. Kho, an OB-GYNE Specialist, examined
Sandra and subjected her to a pelvic ultra-sound examination.  The results were positive.  The fetus' gestational age was equivalent to
17.1 weeks.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Another ultra-sound examination at the United Doctors Medical Center (UDMC) at
Quezon City on September 11, 1989 confirmed that she was indeed pregnant.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 11, 1990, Sandra gave birth to a baby boy who was
named Jacob Salcedo.  Hence, the filing
of the complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
by Mrs. Pastora Salcedo.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation conducted by the CIS, about thirty (30)
pictures of different persons were laid on the table and Sandra was asked to
pick up the pictures of her assailants.  Sandra singled out the pictures of Moreno Tumimpad and Ruel Prieto.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Later, Sandra was brought out of the investigation room to a police line-up of
ten people, including Moreno Tumimpad and Ruel Prieto.  She was again asked to point to her
assailants.  Without hesitation, Sandra
fingered Moreno Tumimpad and Ruel Prieto.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Pastora Salcedo testified that she requested her two
daughters-in-law, Joy Salcedo and Celsa Salcedo, to ask Sandra the identity of
the persons who sexually molested her.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Joy confirmed in her testimony that she asked Sandra who sexually
molested her.  Sandra revealed that
Moreno Tumimpad and Ruel Prieto were the ones who raped her.  Sandra demonstrated how she was raped.  First, her thighs were touched, then she was
hugged and her panty was taken off.  A
push and pull movement followed.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Celsa testified that she was present when the victim demonstrated how she was
sexually abused by the two accused, including the way her nipples were touched
saying "dito hawak," and holding her breasts to emphasize.  She likewise went through the motion of
removing her panty, uttering at the same time "hubad panty."</p>

<p class="BODY">Sandra identified in open court accused Moreno Tumimpad and Ruel <span style="">Prieto as </span>the persons who raped her
and said she wished them dead, as they did something bad to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
She once again demonstrated how she was sexually abused.  She held her two thighs with her two hands
next to her sexual organ saying, "panty" and then placed her hand on
her breast and gestured as if she were sucking.  She also touched her private organ and made a push and pull
movement.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the accused moved that a blood test, both
"Major Blood Grouping Test" and "Pheno Blood Typing" be
conducted on the offended party, her child Jacob and the two accused.  The result of the test conducted by the
Makati Medical Center showed that Jacob Salcedo has a type "O" blood,
Sandra Salcedo type "B," accused Ruel Prieto type "A" and
accused-appellant type "O."</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused anchored their defense on mere denial contending
that it was impossible for them to have committed the crime of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the trial court convicted Moreno
Tumimpad of the crime charged but acquitted the other accused, Ruel Prieto, on
reasonable doubt, stating that he "has a different type of blood with
(sic) the child Jacob Salcedo as his type of blood is "A", while that
of child Jacob Salcedo is type "O."</p>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">WHEREFORE, </span>premises
considered, the Court finds the accused, PO1 Moreno Tumimpad, guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape, as charged in the information, and
pursuant to the provisions of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as
amended, there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance attendant in
the commission of the crime, said accused Moreno Tumimpad is hereby sentenced
to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA; to indemnify the offended girl,
Sandra Salcedo, in the amount of P20,000.00; and to suffer the other accessory
penalties provided for by laws; and to pay the costs of the proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On reasonable doubt, accused Ruel Prieto is hereby declared
ACQUITTED from the charge.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant assigns the following as errors of the lower
court:</p>

<blockquote>1. The lower court erred in not appreciating the impossibility of
committing the offense charged without detection.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The lower court erred in convicting the accused-appellant base
on major blood grouping test known as ABO and RHS test, not a paternal test
known as chromosomes or HLA test.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant argues that it was impossible for him to have
committed the crime of rape because most of the time he and his co-accused Ruel
Prieto were together with Col. Salcedo on inspection tours while the victim was
always in the company of her mother.  He
further contends that it was likewise impossible for Sandra, if she had really
been molested, not to have shouted out of pain, she being a virgin.  As if adding insult to injury,
accused-appellant suggests that it was Sandra's brother, Cristopher Salcedo,
allegedly a drug user, who could have raped her.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not convinced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the accused usually went with Col. Salcedo during
inspection tours but sometimes they were left behind and would play pingpong or
card games with Sandra at the ground floor of the house.  While Sandra was always with her mother,
there were times when she was left alone in the house with the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mrs. Pastora Salcedo testified:</p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many security men remain if you can recall when your husband reported for work?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two

<p class="BODY">The victim more than once positively identified accused-appellant
Moreno Tumimpad as one of the perpetrators of the crime.  First, during the investigation conducted by
the CIS, Sandra singled out accused-appellant and his co-accused from among the
thirty (30) pictures of different persons shown to her.  Second, at the police lineup of several
persons, likewise conducted by the CIS, Sandra once again unerringly pointed
accused-appellant and his co-accused as the ones who raped her.  Third, in open court, Sandra without
hesitation, pointed to accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following is the victim's own testimony:</p>

<blockquote>PROS. RAMOS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Will you please
demonstrate before this Honorable Court what Moreno and Ruel did to you?</blockquote>

movement and she cried.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant simplistically and quite erroneously argues
that his conviction was based on the medical finding that he and the victim
have the same blood type "O."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants' culpability was established mainly by
testimonial evidence given by the victim herself and her relatives.  The blood test was adduced as evidence only
to show that the alleged father or any one of many others of the same blood
type may have been the father of the child.  As held by this Court in <i><span style="">Janice
Marie Jao vs. Court of Appeals</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">:<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<blockquote>Paternity - Science has demonstrated that by the analysis of blood
samples of the mother, the child, and the alleged father, it can be established
conclusively that the man is not the father of a particular child.  But group blood testing cannot show only a
possibility that he is.  Statutes in
many states, and courts in others, have recognized the value and the
limitations of such tests.  Some of the
decisions have recognized the conclusive presumption of non-paternity where the
results of the test, made in the prescribed manner, show the impossibility of
the alleged paternity.  This is one of
the few cases in which the judgment of the Court may scientifically be
completely accurate, and intolerable results avoided, such as have occurred
where the finding is allowed to turn on oral testimony conflicting with the
results of the test.  The findings of
such blood tests are not admissible to prove the fact of paternity as they show
only a possibility that the alleged father or any one of many others with the
same blood type may have been the father of the child.</blockquote>
