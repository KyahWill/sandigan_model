<p class="BODY">The petitioners are the children of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>

<p class="BODY">The alleged sale was <span class="GramE">effected</span> through an
absolute deed of sale (Exhibit A) bearing the <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>, signed

 15, 1957</st1:date>, several months after the document was executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the non-notarized deed could not be
registered, Adriano Lee asked that the petitioners and their stepmother, <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>, who was also made
defendant, be compelled to execute the necessary documents pursuant to Article
1357 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her answer, <span class="SpellE">Gica</span> admitted practically all the averments of the
complaint filed against her by her son-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to the complaint, the petitioners alleged that
Exhibit "A" is a spurious and forged document and raised various
reasons to show its alleged fraudulent nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In their special defenses and counterclaim, they also alleged, among
others, that the parcel of land allegedly sold through Exhibit "A" is
the same parcel of land which was the subject matter of a <st1:date year="1952" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1952</st1:date> deed of donation which they asked
to be annulled in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-5066 of the same Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They asked why this deed of sale should
surface only after they filed an action against their stepmother to annul a
deed of donation of the same piece of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span> was
the defendant and the petitioners the plaintiffs in the latter case.</p>

<p class="BODY">After respondent Adriano Lee rested his case in CC No. R-36
(R-7020), respondent <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>
filed a cross-claim against the petitioners adopting and incorporating as part
of her cross-claim the allega­tions of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the special defenses of their answer to the cross-claim, the
petitioners alleged, among others, (a) that Branch V of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> had already rendered a partial
judgment in Civil Case No. R-5066 declaring null and void the deed of donation <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span> executed by <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June
13, 1952 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>
and declaring the petitioners as the co-owners of the land in question; and (b)
that the parcel of land involved in the said partial judgment is the same
parcel of land described in paragraph 3 of the complaint (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-36 [R-7020]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
also attached a copy of the Partial Judgment to their answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The partial judgment was made an integral

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After due hearing, the

<p class="BODY">On March 18, 1971, the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of
the lower court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decision penned by
Justice <span class="SpellE">Hermogenes</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>,
Jr. and concurred in by Justices <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> G. Martin
and Cecilia <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> Palma, the Court of Appeals ruled
that the evidence supports the conclusion of the lower court in upholding the
validity of the deed of absolute sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the claim of the petitioners that the questioned property was the
conjugal property of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and his first wife <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Perida</span>, the court ruled that this issue was not
raised in the lower court, hence, it could not for the first time be raised on
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> the petitioners
assigned the following errors:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">"FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE ISSUE
ASSIGNED BY THE APPELLANTS IN THEIR SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR THAT THE LAND IN

EXECUTED ON APRIL <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">4, 1960, </span>CONSIDERING
SAID EXHIBIT WAS ALLEGEDLY EXECUTED ON APRIL 4, 1956 AND SEVERINO MONTESA DIED
ON JANUARY 15, 1957."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Was the Court of Appeals correct in ignoring the assigned error
on the conjugal nature of the property?</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that when respondent Adriano Lee merely
alleged in his reply and answer to their counterclaim in CC No. <span class="GramE">R-36 (R-7020), that he was not a party in CC No.</span> R-5066 and
had no interest in the outcome thereof, he admitted as a fact that the land
involved in the two civil cases is the same piece of land so that they
(petitioners) did not have to introduce evidence to show that the land was the
conjugal property of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and his first wife <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Perida</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also argued that in their answer to Adriano Lee's
complaint as well as in their answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
<span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica's</span> cross-claim
they (petitioners) raised the issue that the parcel of land sold through
Exhibit "A" is the same parcel of land subject matter of the case
filed against <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>
in CC No. R-5066 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
Branch V and that the latter court had already rendered a partial
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court ruled that the deed
of donation involving the same parcel of land given by <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> to his second wife <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gica</span> was null and void and that the petitioners were
co-owners of the same parcel of land described in Exhibit "A".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondents claim that there is nothing in the answer which raised as
an issue or which was pleaded therein as a special or affirmative defense
asserted in plain, concise and direct language that would show that the land in
question is the conjugal property of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and the deceased <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Perida</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The private respondents
state that the allegations in the special and affirmative defenses of the
petitioners' answer raised only the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

spur­ious document;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) <span class="GramE">that</span> it was alleged as surprising why
the document was only brought before the trial court after Civil Case No.
R-5066 was filed for the annulment of the Deed of Donation; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the purpose of plaintiff's filing the case

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We find the petitioners'
stand well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that
the petitioners, in their answer to the complaint in Civil Case No. R-36
(R-7020), alleged, among others, as special defenses -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

considered to mean that the land in question is the conjugal property of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Perida</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Adriano Lee and <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span> contended during the trial of this case that with the
death of <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Perida</span> in
1935, the conjugal partnership of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa's</span> first marriage was dissolved and that the
children of the first marriage, petitioners herein, already received their
respective shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1936 or one year
after <span class="SpellE">Perida'a</span> death, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span> were married.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The decision in Civil Case No.</span> R-5066,
which was made a part of the answer in this case belied the above claim and
awarded the disputed lot as co-owned by the petitioners and <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gica</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
basis for the co-ownership was the claim of the petitioners that they inherited
the land from their parents <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Perida</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lot that
<span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> tried so
hard to give to <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>,
his second wife - first through a deed of donation which was nullified by the
court and second through the un-notarized and thumb marked deed of sale to
Adriano Lee but with lifetime <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> rights of <span class="SpellE">Anatalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>, Lee's
mother-in-law -was, therefore, found by the court in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">R-5066 to be conjugal property.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arguments of Lee and <span class="SpellE">Gica</span>
that they introduced no evidence to dispute the conjugal nature of the property
because this was not an issue in the case have no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The property involved in the donation case (CC No. R-5066) and in
the deed of sale case (CC No. R-7020) is exactly the same parcel of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court should have taken note
of the decision in CC No. R-5066 appended to and made a part of the answers in
CC No. <span class="GramE">R-7020 instead of ruling that the assigned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">error </span>on the conjugal character of the
land could not be raised for the first time on appeal.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that way, justice could have been served
better.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue raised in this petition refers to the validity of
the questioned deed of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
authenticity and due execution of the deed of sale were sustained by the trial
court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We see no compelling reason to deviate from the rule that findings of
facts of the respondent court based on substantial evidence cannot be reviewed
by <span class="GramE">Us</span> in a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span> could not validly convey properties which did not
belong to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As clearly discernible
from the records, the questioned parcel is conjugal property of the first
marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the deed of sale
(Exhibit "A) is valid only up to the extent of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montesa's</span> share in the said property.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, (1) The finding of the Court of Appeals that
the conjugal character of the questioned parcel of land was raised for the
first time on appeal is reversed and set aside; (2) We affirm the Court of
Appeals decision upholding the authenticity, genuineness, and due execution of
the deed of sale (Exhibit "A") but with a modification.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The validity of the deed of sale extends only
up to the share of <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>
over the land in question; (3) Civil Case No. R-36 (R-7020) is hereby remanded
to the trial court for the partition and determination of the res­pective
shares of the parties over the same parcel of land in accordance with this
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs
against the respondents.</span></p>
