<p class="BODY"><span>Marino P. Rubin obtained from the <span class="SpellE">Binalbagan</span> Branch of petitioner Philippine National Bank 
(Bank, for short) a </span><span>1954-1955 </span><span>sugar crop loan in the 
amount of P40<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>, secured </span><span>by 
</span><span>a chattel mortgage executed by Rubin as debtor-mortgagor and Jose 
A. Campos as mortgagor.<span>&nbsp; </span>As additional security, private respondent 
Philippine Phoenix Surety and Insurance, Inc. 
(</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Phoenix</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> 
for short) issued Surety Bond No. 88 for P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in 
favor of petitioner Bank.<span>&nbsp; </span>Liability under said bond was to expire 
one (1) year from the date thereof, unless within ten (10) days from its 
expiration, the surety is notified of any existing obligations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Three months later, petitioner Bank increased the loan from 
P40<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> to P56,800.00, without the knowledge and 
consent of private respondent 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Phoenix</span></st1:place></st1:city><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>When Rubin failed to liquidate said loan, </span>petitioner 
Bank demanded of private respondent 
<st1:city><st1:place>Phoenix</st1:place></st1:city> that it make good its 
undertaking as surety for Rubin up to the stated amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondent 
<st1:city><st1:place>Phoenix</st1:place></st1:city> denied liability, resulting 
in petitioner instituting a collection case against Rubin, his guarantors and 
sureties, including private respondent 
<st1:city><st1:place>Phoenix</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The trial court ruled in favor of petitioner Bank, ordering, 
among others, private respondent 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Phoenix</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> to 
pay petitioner the sum of P10</span><span class="GramE"><span>,000</span></span><span> </span><span>upon failure of the 
principal debtor Rubin and his guarantors to pay the judgment amount.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On appeal, the Court of Appeals modified the trial court's decision by 
exonerating private respondent 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Phoenix</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> 
from liability under its surety bond.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition 
for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The discharge of private respondent 
<st1:city><st1:place>Phoenix</st1:place></st1:city> from liability under Surety 
Bond No. 88 is correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>Contrary to petitioner's thinking, the 
contract in question is not a continuing chattel mortgage for which consent and 
knowledge of the surety is unnecessary for an increase in the amount of the 
principal obligation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The contract of chattel mortgage itself 
fixed the credits, loans, overdrafts, <em>etc.</em> and other valuable 
consideration received <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> at Forty Thousand 
Two Hundred Pesos [P40<span class="GramE">,200.00</span>].<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
undertaking under said contract was "for the purpose of securing their payment 
including the interest thereon, the cost of collection and other obligations 
owing by the Debtor-Mortgagor to the mortgagee, whether direct or indirect, 
principal or secondary as appears in the accounts, books and records of the 
mortgagee x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." <span class="GramE">[p. 179, Record on Appeal].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Applying the 
principle of <span class="SpellE"><em>ejusdem</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>generis</em></span>, the term "other obligations" must be 
limited to such as are of the same nature as interest and costs of 
collection.<span>&nbsp; </span>The term cannot be enlarged to include future 
additional advances to debtor-mortgagor, much less be interpreted as a previous 
authorization from the surety to increase the principal amount fixed in the 
contract.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The increase in the indebtedness from P40<span class="GramE">,200.00</span> to P56,800.00 is material and prejudicial to private 
respondent 
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span>Phoenix</span></st1:place></st1:city><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>While the liability of private respondent under the bond is limited to 
P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, the increase in the amount of the debt 
proportionally decreased the probability of the principal debtor being able to 
liquidate the debt; thus, increasing the risk undertaken by the surety to answer 
for the failure of the debtor to pay.<span>&nbsp; </span>"A material alteration of 
the principal contract, <span class="GramE">effected</span> by the creditor and 
principal debtor without the knowledge and consent of the surety, completely 
discharges the surety from all liability in the contract of <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>." <span class="GramE">[<em>Asiatic Petroleum Co. 
vs. Hizon and David</em>, 45 Phil. 532; <em>Phil. National Bank vs. 
Veraguth</em>, 50 Phil. 253].</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals under 
review is hereby affirmed.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against 
petitioner.</span></p></div>
