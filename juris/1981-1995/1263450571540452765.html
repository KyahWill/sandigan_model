				<H3>MARIA C. RAMOS, PETITIONER, VS.
COURT OF APPEALS, JUDGE JESUS R. DE VEGA OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF BULACAN, MALOLOS BRANCH II AND
THE MUNICIPALITY OF HAGONOY, BULACAN,
RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the legality of a municipality's hiring of
private counsel to file a suit in its behalf.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, through the law firm of Cruz Durian &amp; Academia
(now Cruz Durian <span class="SpellE">Agabin</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
&amp; <span class="SpellE">Alday</span>), sued in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> Domingo, <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> Guzman, Maria C. Ramos and <span class="SpellE">Consorcio</span>
Cruz for the recovery of its 74-hectare fishpond (Civil Case No. 5095-M).</p>

<p class="BODY">In paragraph 19 of the complaint it was alleged that the
municipality had obligated itself to pay Cruz Durian &amp; Academia as
attorney's fees not less than twenty percent of the amount to be recovered by
the plaintiff (p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The provincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and
the municipal attorney of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span> entered their
appearance as counsel for the municipality with the manifestation that its
private counsel would be under the control and <span class="GramE">supervision</span>
of those officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding that
appearance, Domingo and Maria C. Ramos (lessee and <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>
of the fishpond) moved to disqualify the Cruz law firm from serving as counsel
of the municipality.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It found that Angel Cruz, the head of the law
firm, volunteered to act as coun­sel for the municipality because he desired to
serve his native town.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ramos and Domingo assailed that order by means of <i>certiorari</i>
in the Court of Appeals which in a decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1979</st1:date> sustained the trial court (Ramos vs.
Judge Jesus R. de Vega, et al., CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. <span class="GramE">SP-7728-R).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos
brought the case to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in
allowing the Cruz law firm to act as counsel for the municipality in
collaboration with the fiscal and the munici­pal attorney.</p>

<p class="BODY">That ruling constitutes a grave abuse of discretion because it is
manifestly a transgression of section 1683 of the Revised Administrative Code
which provides that "the provincial fiscal shall represent the province
and any municipality or municipal district thereof in any court, except <span style="">in cases whereof original jurisdiction is
vested in the Supreme Court or in cases where the municipality or municipal dis­trict
in question is a party adverse to the provincial govern­ment or to some other
municipality or municipal district in the same province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the interests of a provincial govern­ment
and of any political division thereof are opposed, the provincial fiscal shall
act on behalf of the province.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
provincial fiscal is disqualified to serve any municipality or other political
subdivision of a province, a special attor­ney may be employed by its
council."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The legislative intent to prohibit a municipality from employing
private counsel in its lawsuits is further imple­mented by section 3 of the
Local Autonomy Act, Republic Act No. 2264, which provides that the municipal
attorney, as the head of the legal division or office of a municipality,
"shall act as legal counsel of the municipality and perform such duties
and exercise such powers as may be assigned to him by the council." The
municipal attorney is paid out of municipal funds (Sec. 4, Republic Act No.
5185, Decen­tralization Act of 1967).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
can represent the municipality even without the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
collaboration (<span class="SpellE">Calleja</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Court of Appeals, L-22501, July
31, 1967, 20 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 895).</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned ruling of the two courts also contra­venes settled
jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying section 1683, it
was held that the municipality's authority to employ a private lawyer is
expressly limited only to situations where the pro­vincial fiscal is
disqualified to represent it (De <span class="SpellE">Guia</span> vs. Auditor
General, L-29824, March 29, 1972, 44 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 169.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">See Reyes vs. <span class="SpellE">Cornista</span>, 92 Phil. 838, </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span class="GramE"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bocaue</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span class="GramE"> vs. <span class="SpellE">Manotok</span>, 93 Phil. 173; Enriquez vs. <span class="SpellE">Gimenez</span>, 107 Phil. 932).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the lawmaker in requiring that the munici­pality
should be represented in its court cases by a govern­ment lawyer like its
municipal attorney and the provincial fiscal intended that the municipality
should not be burdened with the expenses of hiring a private lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lawmaker also assumed that the interests
of the municipality would be best protected if a government lawyer handles its
litigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be expected that the municipal attorney and the fiscal
would be faithful and dedicated to the municipa­lity's interests and that, as
civil service employees, they could be held accountable for any misconduct or
derelic­tion of duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals perceived nothing illegal in allowing the
Cruz Law Office to represent the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
because lawyer Cruz offered his legal services <u>gratis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Ramos in her second motion for
recon­sideration called the Court's<span style=""> </span>attention
to paragraph 19 of the complaint wherein the Cruz law firm alleged that the
municipality had contracted to pay its lawyer a 20% contin­gent fee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in a resolution dated December 6, 1979 said
that there was no cogent reason to reconsider its decision but at the same time
it gave the Cruz law firm fifteen days from notice within which "to amend
the answer" (should be complaint) in the trial court by "deleting <span class="SpellE">there­from</span> the claim for attorney's fees" and to
report such amendment to the Court of Appeals; otherwise, it would "<span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
reconsider its decision".</p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the Appellate Court wanted the complaint to conform to
its erroneous factual finding that the Cruz law firm was serving as counsel
without compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not notice
that its resolution was ambivalent because <span style="">while it denied the second motion for reconsideration, in the same
breath it threatened to "reconsider its decision" if the complaint
was not amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Following that directive, the Cruz law firm filed in the trial
court an amended complaint dated December 31, 1979 containing the allegation in
paragraph 19 thereof that the municipality was forced to retain the Cruz law
firm "as additional counsel under the control and supervision of
plaintiff's principal attorneys and/or the Provincial Fiscal without any
obligation to pay attorney's fees".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prayer for the payment of attorney's fees in the original complaint
was eliminated in the amended complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ramos contended in the
trial court </span>and in <span style="">the Court </span>of
Appeals that the trial court could not admit the amended complaint because it
was immobilized by the restraining order issued by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals did not resolve that
contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 7, 1980, Ramos filed in this Court her petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
<i>mandamus</i> and prohibition wherein she prayed that the Court of Appeals be
directed to resolve the issue raised in her second motion for reconsideration
and that the amended complaint should not be taken into consideration because
it was improperly admitted by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the Court of Appeals was furnished on May 7, 1980 with a
copy of that petition, it nevertheless, issued a resolution dated May 22, 1981
requiring the Cruz law firm to inform it of "the further development on
the matter" (p. 113, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court treated Ramos' petition as an appeal from the
Appellate Court's decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ramos was
confused as to when she would appeal from that decision because, as noted
earlier, while the Appellate Court denied her second motion for
reconsideration, the denial was not final since it was accompanied by the
warning that it would "reconsider its decision" if the complaint was
not amended to eliminate the claim of the Cruz law firm for attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the alleged tardiness of
the petition was excusable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the municipal attorney and the fiscal are supposed
to collaborate with a private law firm does not legalize the latter's
representation of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
in Civil Case No. 5095-M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While a
private prosecutor is allowed in criminal cases, an analogous arrangement is
not allowed in civil cases wherein a muni­cipality is the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1683 of the Revised Administrative Code, as complemented
by section 3 of the Local Autonomy Law, is clear in providing that only the
provincial fiscal and the municipal attorney can represent a municipality in
its law­suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That provision is
mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law being clear and unmistakable, there is no room for
interpretation or for engrafting upon it exceptions or qualifications not
contemplated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As observed by
Justice Moreland:</p>

<blockquote>"Where language is plain, subtle refinements which tinge words
so as to give them the color of a particular judicial theory are not only
unnecessary but decidedly harm­ful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
which has caused so much confusion in the law, which has made it so difficult
for the public to understand and know what the law is with respect to a given
matter, is in considerable measure the unwarranted interference by judicial
tribunals with the English language as found in statutes and contracts, cutting
out words here and inserting them there, making them fit personal ideas of what
the legis­lature ought to have done or what parties should have agreed upon,
giving them meanings which they do not ordinarily have, cutting, trimming,
fitting, changing and coloring until law­yers themselves are unable to advise
their clients as to the meaning of a given statute or contract until it has
been sub­mitted to some court for its 'interpretation and construction'."
(<span class="SpellE">Yangco</span> vs. Court of First Instance of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
29 Phil. 183, 188).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Construction and interpretation come only after it has been
demonstrated <span style="">that </span>application is
impossible or inadequate without them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are the very last functions which a court should exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The majority of the laws need no
interpretation or construction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="">They require only application</span></u><span style="">, </span>and if there were more application
and less construction, there would be more stability in the law, and more
people would know what the law is." (<span class="SpellE">Lizarraga</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> vs. <st1:place>Yap</st1:place> <span class="SpellE">Tico</span>,
24 Phil. 504, 513).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals is
reversed and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hereby declare
that the appearance in the aforementioned case of Cruz Dorian <span class="SpellE">Agabin</span> <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> as counsel for the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Hagonoy</span> is contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The municipality should be represented by its municipal attorney and by
the pro­vincial fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order is lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> De Castro, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">JJ</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.</span></span><br>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, J., (Chairman), <span style="font-style: normal;">concurs on the strictly technical grounds stated in
the main opinion. He feels however, that a municipality or province should be
able to seek the help of competent counsel, if it feels its case is of such
importance that the services of the fiscal and the municipal attorney would be
inadequate and the assistance of private counsel is offered <u>gratis</u>. Anyway,
the Cruz Law office can very well help the government lawyers without having to
make any formal appearance. Withal, perhaps permission by the Minister of
Justice may solve the situation of the municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
