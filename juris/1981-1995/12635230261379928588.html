This case is about the rescission of a deed of exchange.  In a 1963 
document, Aquilina P. Marin assigned to the brothers Manuel P. Armada 
and Ariston P. Armada her hereditary share in the testate estate of her 
deceased mother, Monica Pacificar Vda. de Provido, situated in Janiuay, 
Iloilo <em>in exchange for</em> the land of the Armadas located in Cotabato covered by TCT No. 7252 and other properties in that province.
<p>
The exchange would be rescindible when it is definitely ascertained that
 the parties have respectively no right to the properties sought to be 
exchanged.  The exchange did not mean that the parties were definitely 
entitled to the properties being exchanged but it was executed "in 
anticipation of a declaration of said right".  The deed of exchange 
reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center"> "DEED OF EXCHANGE WITH QUITCLAIM </p>

        3.   That the ARMADAS know for a fact that the properties being

both declaring that the properties received by way of exchange under 
this document is ade­quate consideration for the properties quitclaimed;

absolute and irrevocable, except only when it is eventually ascertained 
and finally determined that they have respectively no right, interest, 
title or partici­pation in any property, real or personal, which they 
have assigned or quitclaimed in favor of each other, and in the event of
 mutual restitution by reason of the above eventuality, the parties 
hereto are not liable for any fruits or benefits which they may have

against the other; </p>
    <p> 7.   That it is specifically understood and agreed that the

are entitled in the pro­perties heretofore quitclaimed but only in 
anticipation of a declaration of said right; </p>
    <p>
        8.   That the parties hereto shall take possession of and make 
use of the properties subject of this DEED OF EXCHANGE AND QUITCLAIM 
upon the signing of the same;
    </p>
    <p>

<p>As background, it should be stated that the Armadas and Mrs. Marin 
are first cousins.  The Armadas in 1963 expected to inherit some lots in
 <em>General Santos City</em> from their uncle, Proceso Pacificar, who 
died in 1954.  Mrs. Marin, who resided in Koronadal Cotabato, had here 
ditary rights in the estates of her parents, the deceased spouses, 
Francisco Provido and Monica Pacificar, of <em>Janiuay, Iloilo</em>, who died in 1938 and 1960, respectively.  Manuel P. Armada resided in <em>Janiuay</em>.</p>
<p>
In 1963, when the deed of exchange was executed, the estate of Proceso 
Pacificar, in which the Armadas expected to inherit a part, had been 
adjudicated to Soledad Provido-Elevencionado, a sister of Mrs. Marin and
 a first cousin also of the Armadas, Soledad claimed to be the sole heir
 of Proceso.  So, the Armadas and the other heirs had to sue Soledad.
</p><p>
The protracted litigation ended in a compromise in <em>1976</em> when the Armadas were awarded Lots 906-A-2 and 906-A-3, located in Barrio Lagao, General Santos City with a total area of <em>8,124 square meters</em>.  Mrs. Marin never possessed these two lots.  They were supposed to be exchanged for her <em>proindiviso share</em> in her parents' estate in Janiuay.
</p><p>
Did Mrs. Marin inherit actually anything from her parents?  The answer is <em>nothing</em>.
  She chose to forget the deed.  Her conduct showed that she con­sidered
 herself not bound by it.  Five years after that deed, or on November 
14, 1968, she agreed to convey to her sister, Aurora Provido-Collado, 
her interest in two lots in Janiuay in payment of her obligation 
amounting to P1,700.
</p><p>
Then, in the extrajudicial partition of her parents' estate on <em>June 25, 1977</em> (when the instant case for rescission was already pending), her share, with a total area of <em>9,000 square meters</em>,
 was formally adjudicated to Aurora.  It was stated therein that Mrs. 
Marin "has waived, renounced and quitclaimed her share" in favor of 
Aurora.  As already stated, that share was supposed to be exchanged for 
the two lots in General Santos City which the Armadas received in 1976 
after a pestiferous litigation.
</p><p>
The Armadas filed the instant rescissory action against Mrs. Marin on 
December 7, 1976.  They overlooked the fact that Ariston P. Armada was 
not bound at all by the deed since Manuel, who signed the deed for him, <em>had no authority to do so</em>.  Manuel was not the attorney-in-fact of Ariston (See Art. 1403 [1], Civil Code).
</p><p>
There was no trial.  The case was submitted on the pleadings.  The sole 
issue resolved by the trial court was prescription.  It held that the 
Armadas' action had not prescribed because their right to rescind 
accrued only in 1976 when they discovered that Mrs. Marin could not 
perform her obligation under the deed since she had assigned her 
hereditary rights to her sister.
</p><p>
Judge Midpantao L. Adil rescinded the deed of exchange, ordered 
restitution of whatever might have been received by Mrs. Marin, released
 the Armadas from their obligation under said deed and ordered Mrs. 
Marin to pay the Armadas P10,000 as moral and exemplary damages and 
P3,000 as attorney's fees.  Mrs. Marin appealed to this Court on legal 
issues (L-49018).
</p><p>
Judge Adil issued an order of execution pending appeal which Mrs. Marin 
assailed by certiorari in this Court.  The enforcement of the execution 
was restrained by this Court (L-47986).  The two related cases have been
 consolidated.
</p><p>
It is evident from the deed of exchange that the intention of the 
parties relative to the lots, which are the objects of the exchange, 
cannot be definitely ascertained.  We hold that this circumstance 
renders the exchange void or inexistent (Art. 1378, 2nd par. and Art. 
1409 [6], Civil Code).
</p><p>
Thus, as already noted, it is provided in <em>paragraph 7</em> that the 
deed should not be construed as an acknowledgment by the Armadas and 
Mrs. Marin that they are entitled to the properties involved therein and
 that it was executed "<em>in anticipation of a declaration of" their rights to the properties</em>.
</p><p>
Then, it is stipulated in <em>paragraph 8</em> that the parties should take possession and make use of the properties involved in the deed.
</p><p>
The two provisions are irreconcilable because paragraph 7 contemplates 
that the properties are still to be awarded or adjudicated to the 
parties whereas paragraph 8 envisages a situation where the parties have
 already control and possession thereof.
</p><p>
It should be noted that in paragraph 7 of Mrs. Marin's answer with 
affirmative defense she avers therein that her 1968 agreement with her 
sister means that she would convey her properties to the latter (Aurora)
 when the Armadas should be "adjudged to be without rights or interests 
to any properties in General Santos City" (p. 47, Rollo of L-49018).  <em>Such a qualification is not found in her agreement with her sister</em>.
</p><p>
The instant rescissory action may be treated as an action to declare 
void the deed of exchange.  The action to declare the inexistence of a 
contract does not prescribe (Art. 1410, Civil Code).
</p><p>
The properties covered by the deed should have been specified and 
described.  A perusal of the deed gives the impression that it involves 
many properties.  In reality, it refers only to 8,124 square meters of 
land, which the Armadas would inherit from their uncle in General Santos
 City, and to the 9,000 square meters representing the <em>proindiviso share</em>
 of Mrs. Marin in her parents' estate.  As we have seen, Mrs. Marin 
rendered impossible the performance of her obligation under the deed.
</p><p>
Because of that impossibility, the Armadas could rescind extrajudicially
 the deed of exchange (Art. 1191 Civil Code; 4 Tolentino, Civil Code, 
1973 Ed., pp. 171- 172).  If Mrs. Marin should sue the Armadas, her 
action would be barred under the rule of <em>exceptio non adimpleti contractus</em> (plaintiff is not entitled to sue because he has not performed his part of the agreement).
</p><p>
As no evidence was presented in this case, we cannot sustain the award 
of P10,000 as moral and exemplary damages and P3,000 as attorney's fees.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the trial court's judgment and the order of execution pending
 appeal are set aside.  The deed of exchange is hereby declared void and
 inexistent.  The annotation thereof on TCT Nos. 10833 and 10834 should 
be cancelled.  The Armadas' claim for damages and attorney's fees is 
denied.  Aquilina Provido-Marin's counter­claim is dismissed.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.

<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Abad Santos, Escolin</em>, and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
