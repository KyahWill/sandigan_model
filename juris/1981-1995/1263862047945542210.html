				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These two cases have been consolidated because they relate to the
same factual antecedents and the same private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issues are:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In G.R. No. 79975, whether or not the private respondent was an
employee of the petitioner and, if so, had been illegally <span class="SpellE">dimissed</span>;
and <span class="SpellE">corollarily</span>, whether or not the NLRC had
jurisdiction over their dispute.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. In G.R. No. 79907, whether or not the petitioner could be held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with Sweet Lines, Inc. to the private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that private respondent Victoria <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span> was hired by Sweet Lines, Inc. on March 5, 1981, as
Senior Branch Officer of its International Accounts Department for a fixed
salary and a stipulated 5% commission on sales production.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December 1, 1983, after tendering her
resignation to accept another offer of employment, she was persuaded to remain
with an offer of her promotion to Manager of the Department with corresponding
increase in compensation, which she accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She was also allowed to buy a second-hand Colt Lancer pursuant to a
liberal car plan under which one-half of the cost was to be paid by the company
and the other half was to be deducted from her salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relations began to sour later, however, when
she repeatedly asked for payment of her commissions, which had accumulated and
were long overdue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also complained
of the inordinate demands on her time even when she was sick and in the
hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on July 16, 1985, she
was served with a letter from Samuel <span class="SpellE">Casas</span> Lim, the
other petitioner, informing her that her "employment with Sweet
Lines" would terminate on August 5, 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Efforts were also taken by Sweet Lines to forcibly take the car from
her, culminating in an action for <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> against
her in the regional trial court of Manila<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On August 14, 1985, <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span> filed a complaint against both petitioners for
illegal dismissal, illegal deduction, and unpaid wages and commissions plus
moral and exemplary damages, among other claims.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

testified on the details of her employment, emphasizing her unsatisfactory
treatment by the management of Sweet Lines and especially the termination of
her services without the required notice and hearing and without valid
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also presented four other
witnesses to corroborate her charges.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The respondents' defenses
were based mainly on the claim that <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span> was not
an employee of Sweet Lines but an independent contractor and that therefore
their dispute with her came under the jurisdiction of the civil courts and not
of the Labor Arbiter.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> On this matter the private respondent

which were marked as <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "A" to
"GG-8d" and 858 receipts and bills, all of which were duly identified
and testified to by private respondent and her witnesses and examined by
petitioners, petitioners failed to present any single evidence, testimonial or
documentary, to controvert private respondent's evidence.<i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>All that they presented were their
unsubstantiated </span>pleadings not one of which was under oath, not even

but Sweet Lines confined itself to mere denials.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the determination of the existence of
employee-employer relations is a factual finding which this Court will not
disturb or reverse in the absence of a showing of grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not see such
justification here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
ascertainment of the employment status of the private respondent was made on

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the fourth issue, we
agree with petitioner Lim that he cannot be held personally liable with Sweet
Lines for merely having signed the letter informing <span class="SpellE">Calsado</span>

that he acted with malice or bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<blockquote>It is basic that a corporation is invested by law with a personality

invoking equity rather than law, observes that making Lim <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>

valid, is really unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
as a condition for the issuance of our temporary restraining order of October
14, 1987, Sweet Lines posted as required a bond in the amount of P850,000.00,
which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">should c</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">over the amounts awarded to the private

<p class="BODY">We especially uphold the award of moral and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exemplary damages in view of the acts of
harassment and bad faith testified to by the private respondent and not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">refuted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

during her employment, the delays in the payment of her commissions,<i> </i>the
pressures exerted upon her even when she was sick in the hospital, the
suggestion of one of the company officers that she discuss her complaints with
him alone in </span>a private place, her arbitrary separation, the questionable
attempts to get the vehicle from her after her dismissal, among other
aggravations, clearly demonstrate the validity of the private respondent's
complaints.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">we </span>hold
that the contention of Sweet Lines that separation pay and back wages are inconsistent
with each other is not well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Separation pay is granted where reinstatement is no longer advisable
because of strained relations between the employee and the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Back wages represent compensation that should
have been earned but were not collected because of the unjust dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bases for computing the two are
different, the first being usually the length of the employeeâs service and the
second the actual period when he was unlawfully prevented from working.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have ordered the payment of both in proper cases<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>otherwise the employee might
be deprived of benefits justly due him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if an employee who has worked only one year is sustained by the
labor court after three years from his unjust dismissal, granting him separation
pay only would entitle him to only one month salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason why he should not also be
paid three years back wages corresponding to the period when he could not
return to his work or could not find employment elsewhere.</p>
