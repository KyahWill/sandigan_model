in conducting and resolving a preliminary in­vestigation of a criminal

<p class="BODY">In his comment,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
the respondent alleged that <span style="">a criminal
complaint for</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">frustrated homicide was filed in the 5th
Municipal Circuit Court of <span class="SpellE">Culasi-Sebaste­-Pandan</span>,
Antique against <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Buaya</span>;
that the crimi­nal complaint was docketed as Criminal Case No. 1352; that Judge
George M. <span class="SpellE">Valente</span> of said circuit court inhibited
himself from conducting the preliminary investigation, hence the Executive
District Judge of Antique designated the respondent, Judge Emilio Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>, Jr. of the 4th Municipal Circuit Court, <span class="SpellE">Barboza-Lawasan-Tibiao</span>, Antique to conduct the preliminary
investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1978</st1:date>,
the respondent judge conduct­ed the preliminary examination wherein the
complainant Tito C. Toledo, his witnesses, Charlie <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
and Dr. Santos <span class="SpellE">Alon</span>, Jr. testified for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Sub-Station Commander, <span class="SpellE">INP</span>, P/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Cadigal</span>, Jr. acted as prosecutor in the absence of the
fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant declared that on July 8, 1978, at 12:00 o'clock
noon, while he was diverting part of the canal water at <span class="SpellE">Alojado's</span>
field, the accused, <span class="SpellE">Ismael</span> <span class="SpellE">Buaya</span>,
who wanted all the water for himself, raised his voice, struck complainant's
right forehead with a stone, hacked him twice below the shoulder, and then ran
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony was substantially
corroborated by complainant's witness, Charlie <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Santos <span class="SpellE">Alon</span>, Jr., a resident
physician of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Culasi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Emergency</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
testified that the com­plainant sustained only one wound although interrupt­ed;
and that said wound, if treated, would not cause instantaneous death of the
complainant unless infect­ed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1978</st1:date>, Doctor Santos <span class="SpellE">Alon</span>, Jr. issued a Medical Certificate to complainant
stating:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Proba­ble Disability
period of Healing Barring <span class="SpellE">Unforseen</span>
Complications:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not apparent During
Physical examination, <span class="GramE">the would</span> will heal less 10
days".</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge explained that inasmuch as the wound
inflicted was not mortal, the accused having hacked the complainant only once,
and the accused did not persist in his attack as he immediate­ly ran home
thereafter thus negating intent to kill, said respondent Judge issued an order
dated August 29, 1978 finding that only the crime of slight phy­sical injuries
was committed and directing the Sub-Station Commander to amend the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1978</st1:date>,
the accused was arraigned and pleaded guilty.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge rendered his decision finding the accused guilty beyond
reason­able doubt of the crime of slight physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appreciating two (2) mitigating circumstances
of plea of guilty and voluntary surrender, without any aggra­vating
circumstance, the respondent judge imposed on the accused the penalty of public
censure, and ordered him to pay the costs of the action, and to indemnify the
complainant in the amount of P20.00 as damages, without subsidiary
imprisonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge erred in ordering the Sub-Station Commander
to file <span class="GramE">an amended</span> information of slight physical
injuries and trying the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the preliminary investigation of a cri­minal offense, the duty of the
municipal circuit judge is to determine whether or not the evidence presented
supports <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>facie</u> the allegations of<span style=""> </span>fact contained in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no legal authority to determine the
character of the crime, and his declaration upon that point can only be re­garded
as an expression of opinion in no wise binding on the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tugaoen</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the Supreme Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is not disputed that herein respondent after conducting a
prelimi­nary investigation in Criminal Case No. 684, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span> and over the object­ion of the
prosecution changed the designation of the crime charged from Grave Slander to
Slight Slander.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Res­pondent judge
justified his action by insisting that he is possessed with such power and that
the same was done <span style="">for the speedy
administration of justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court,
however, is not prepared to sustain this view for Section 13, Rule 110, Rules
of Court is clear that the matter of changing the designation of the
appropriate crime in an information or complaint is vested in the prosecu­tion
and not in the trial judge, and in the instant case, the change may be done by
the prosecution even without leave of court since the defendant or accused has
not as yet entered his plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
providing that the information or complaint may be amended in substance or form
with­out leave of court any time before the defendant pleads lodges a
discretionary power in the prosecuting officer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Conde</span> vs. CFI, No. 21236,
October 1, 1923, 45 Phil. 173).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So, the person authorized to amend the complaint or information is only
prosecuting officer and not the trial judge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contention of the respondent judge that he had the right to amend
the designation of the crime in a preliminary investigation which is not the
trial proper is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose
of preliminary investigation is primarily to determine whether there is
reasonable ground to believe that an offense has been committed and the accused
is probably guilty thereof, so that a warrant of arrest may be issued and the
accused held for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not within
the purview of the preliminary investigation to give the judge the right to
amend, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
the designation of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">When </span><span style="">the crime comes within his jurisdiction, he shall try the case, and
only after trial may he convict for </span>a lesser offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a case coming within the original
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, he should elevate the<span style=""> </span>case as it is, even if in his opinion,
the crime is less than that charged."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing rulings of this Court leave no doubt that the
respondent judge committed a serious irregularity when he ordered the
Sub-Station Commander to amend the information from frustrated homicide to
slight physical injuries and tried the case on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span>the respondent Municipal Circuit
Court Judge Emilio Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>, Jr. is hereby found
guilty of ignorance of the law and is imposed the penalty of a fine equivalent
to three (3) months salary with warning that a repetition of the same or
similar offense will be dealt with more severely.</p>
