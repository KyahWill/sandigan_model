<p class="BODY">It is not known whether the other heirs whose names appear in the
document had already signed the document at the time Paz Garcia was approached
by Juanita <span class="SpellE">Bertomo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paz Garcia, however, testified that she immediately informed her brother
Francisco that Juanita <span class="SpellE">Bertomo</span> wanted to sell the
land to Jose <span class="SpellE">Calaliman</span> (TSN, September 6, 1957, p.
62).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1954" day="26" month="12">December 26, 1954</st1:date> he wrote respondents giving them notice
of his desire to exercise the right of legal redemption and that he will resort
to court action if denied the right (Exhibits, p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents received the letter on <st1:date year="1955" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1955</st1:date> but petitioner
Francisco Garcia did not get any answer from them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did respondents show him a copy of
the document of sale nor inform him about the price they paid for the sale when
he went home to <span class="SpellE">Tubungan</span> from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
sometime in March 1955 and went to see the respondent spouse about the matter
on <st1:date year="1955" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1955</st1:date> (TSN,
September 6, 1957, p. 18).</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the refusal of respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Calaliman</span>
to show him the document of sale or reveal to him the price paid for the parcel
of land, petitioner Francisco Garcia went to the Office of the Register of
Deeds on the same date, March 24, 1955 and there found two documents of sale
regarding the same parcel of land (TSN, ibid, p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed the case for legal redemption with the trial
court on <st1:date year="1955" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1955</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents claim that the 30-day period
prescribed in Article 1088 of the New Civil Code for petitioners to exercise
the right to legal redemption had already elapsed at that time and that the
requirement of Article 1088 of the New Civil Code that notice must be in
writing is deemed satisfied because written notice would be superfluous, the
purpose of the law having been fully served when petitioner Francisco Garcia
went to the Office of the Register of Deeds and saw for himself, read and understood
the contents of the deeds of sale (Brief for respondents, p. 6).</p>
