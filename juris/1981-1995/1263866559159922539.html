the sale made by Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> of her property

(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) and the subsequent sale by said spouses of
the same property to <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ferrer</span>,
and (2) declared that the earlier deeds of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.

of the land, <span class="GramE">subject</span> to her lifetime usufruct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals thereby reversed the

<p class="BODY">Private respondents opposed the Motion for Reconsideration
asserting that the partition <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>
which had been implemented long before the execution of the said Last Will and
Testament could not be revoked by the later instrument; that the supposed Last
Will and Testament was executed on December 11, 1969, more than one year after
the filing of the complaint for annulment on October 9, 1968, when said Manuela
<span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> was already senile and not of disposing
mind; that while Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> was able to sign
with her own hand the several Deeds of Sale, the supposed Last Will and
Testament bears her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> only; that Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> had no more property to dispose of by will on
December 11, 1969, when she supposedly executed her Last Will and Testament.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 28, 1984, the Appellate Court denied the Motion for
Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their petition for review of the decision of the Court of
Appeals, the petitioners allege:</p>

<p class="2Q">“(1) <span class="GramE">That</span> the Intermediate Appellate Court
(now Court of Appeals) erred in declaring valid the deeds of sale (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A, B, C and D) as a partition by an act <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span><i> </i>considering that examining the said
exhibits will reveal that it <span style="">is not a
testament amounting to a <u>will</u> of Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span>;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“(2) That the Intermediate Appellate Court erred in ruling against
Article 1347 of the New <span style="">Civil
Code." <span class="GramE">(p. 126, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find those contentions not well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1080 of the New Civil Code allows a person to make a
partition of his estate either by an act <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>
or by <u>will</u> and such partition shall be respected insofar as it does not
prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span> of the compulsory heirs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">While the law prohibits
contracts upon future inheritance, the partition by the parent, as provided in
Art.</span> 1080, is a case expressly authorized by law (Art. 1347, par. 2,
Civil Code of the Phil. by Padilla, 1987 Edition, p. 744.) Art. 1080 of the
Civil Code clearly gives <span class="GramE">a person two options</span> in
making a partition of his estate:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>either
by an act <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span> or by WILL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a person makes a partition by will, it
is imperative that such partition must be executed in accordance with the
provisions of the law on wills; however, when a person makes the partition of
his estate by an act <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>, such
partition may even be oral or written, and need not be in the form of a will,
provided that the partition does not prejudice the <span class="SpellE">legitime</span>
of compulsory heirs.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In numerous cases it has been held or stated that <span class="SpellE">parol</span> partitions may be sustained on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> of the parties to assert the rights of a tenant in
common as to parts of land divided by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> partition
as to which possession in severalty was taken and acts of individual ownership
were exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And a court of equity
will recognize <span style="">the agreement and decree
it to be valid and effectual for the purpose of concluding the right of the
parties as between each other to hold their respective parts in severalty.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"A <span class="SpellE">parol</span> partition may also be
sustained on the ground that the parties thereto have acquiesced in and
ratified the partition by taking possession in severalty, exercising acts of
ownership with respect thereto, or otherwise recognizing the existence of the
partition." <span class="GramE">(Hernandez vs. <span class="SpellE">Andal</span>,
et al., 78 Phil. 196, 203.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the respondent appellate court declared the
Deeds of Sale executed by <span class="SpellE">Presentacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Floserfina</span> and Raquel, all surnamed Chavez (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A, B, and C) in favor of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
Chavez as evidence of a valid partition of the land in question by and between
Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> and her children as she not only
gave her authority thereto but also signed the sales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The Deeds of Sale (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> A, B, and C) are not contracts entered into
with respect to future inheritance but a contract perfected and consummated
during the lifetime of Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> who signed
the same and gave her consent thereto.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such partition <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>,
executed by the property owner herself, is valid.</p>

<p class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">As</span> the defendants freely participated in the partition, they
are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from denying and repudiating the
consequences of their own voluntary acts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a general principle of law that no one may be permitted to disavow
and go back upon his own acts, or to proceed contrary thereto." (Joaquin
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mitsumine</span>, 34 Phil. 858.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Where a piece of land has been included in a partition, and
there is no allegation that the inclusion was effected through improper means
or without the petitioner's knowledge, the partition barred any further
litigation on said title and operated to bring the property under the control
and jurisdiction of the court for proper disposition <span style="">according to the tenor of the partition. . . <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They cannot attack the partition collaterally

<p class="BODY">As well argued by counsel for the respondents in their
memorandum, it would be unjust and inequitable to allow Manuela <span class="SpellE">Buenavista</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Chavez to
revoke the sales’ she herself authorized as well as the sale she herself
executed in favor of her son only to execute a simulated sale in favor of her
daughter Raquel who had already profited from the sale she made of the property
she had received in the partition <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>vivos</u></span>;
it would run counter to the doctrine that "no person should be allowed to
unjustly enrich herself at the expense of another."</p>
