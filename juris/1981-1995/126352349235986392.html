The Court of Appeals in its decision dated August 7, 1975 allowed 
Basilisa Generoso to redeem for P4,000 from Teodora A. Nicolas Lagasca 
the one-sixth <em>pro-indiviso </em>share of Basilisa's co-owner, 
Gorgonia Generoso, in Lot No. 6396 of the Dumaguete cadastre, with an 
area of 1,234 square meters (with building) located at the corner of 
Alfonso XIII and Noblefranca Streets and assessed at P24,340.  The 
redemption should be made <em>within thirty days from the finality of the judgment</em>.
<p>
This Court dismissed Lagasca's petition for review of the Appellate 
Court's decision which became final and executory on April 4, 1976 
(L-41915).  Basilisa had deposited<em> in 1970 </em>the redemption price of P4,000 pursuant to the lower court's judgment.  But <em>in 1975,</em>
 while the case was pending in the Appellate Court, her lawyer, Jose G. 
Hernando, Jr., withdrew the P4,000 from the court and used it for his 
personal purposes.
</p><p>
Basilisa made another deposit of P4,000 on <em>November 29, 1976 </em>to
 effect the redemption.  Judge Vamenta in his order of February 11, 1977
 disallowed the redemption because it should have been made on or before
 <em>May 4, 1976,</em> the last day of the thirty-day period (p. 18, <em>Rollo</em>).  This order is being assailed in the instant <em>certiorari </em>petition filed on June 2, 1977 through lawyers Edelmiro A. Amante and Nemesio D. Tejero, Jr.
</p><p>
Hernando admitted in his comment that he withdrew the redemption money (pp. 46-48, <em>Rollo</em>).
  His misconduct was referred to the Solicitor General in the resolution
 dated May 5, 1978.  His case is pending as Administrative Case No. 
1938.
</p><p>
In the meantime, Basilisa, <em>without informing this Court, sold on November 28, 1977</em>,
 for P40,000 to Natividad Delgado, the alleged common-law wife of Ang 
Tay, the disputed one-sixth interest in the property in litigation with 
an area of 235 square meters (pp. 151-152, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
Lawyer Henry Nicolas, an heir of deceased respondent Lagasca, and one 
Vincent Torres, in their affidavits of July 23, 1980, swore that Ang Tay
 had purchased the five-sixth share of the five Generosos in the 
property and that Ang Tay had been negotiating for the purchase of the 
one-sixth share in the name of his mother, Teodora C. Nicolas Lagasca 
(p. 116-117, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
By reason of the sale, Felix M. Lagrito, son-in-law and counsel of 
Lagasca, filed on August 11, 1980 a motion to dismiss this case because 
the petitioners have no more interest in the case (p. 115, <em>Rollo</em>).
</p><p>
As the contending parties have sold to Ang Tay for distinct 
considerations the controverted one-sixth portion, the dismissal of the 
instant case is unavoidable. "Where all substantial interest in the 
controversy has been parted with or extinguished, a motion for dismissal
 of the appeal is proper" (J. Moreland in Velasco vs. Rosenberg, 29 
Phil. 212).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the motion is granted.  This case is dismissed for having become moot and academic.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Escolin, </em>and<em> Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, J., (Chairman)</em>, no part.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J., </em>reserves his vote.
