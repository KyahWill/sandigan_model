JUDGE BERNARDO P. PARDO, COMPLAINANT, VS.
MARLEO J. ACADEMIA, DEPUTY SHERIFF, RTC,
MANILA, BRANCH 27, RESPONDENT.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Within a period of three years and three months, the following
administrative cases were filed against <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia, a Deputy Sheriff of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, National Capital Judicial Region:</p>

<p class="NUM"><st1:place><b><span style="">I.</span></b></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>ADM.</u> <u>MATTER</u> <u>NO.</u> <u>P-87-72</u>,
which is based on a Complaint-Affidavit of Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
filed on 8 April 1987 by complainant’s counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Yabut</span>, Jr. in the Office of the Court
Administrator charging him and Atty. Alex Y. Tan of bribery, qualified theft,
and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. No. 3019, as
amended) and praying that respondent Academia, as well as his sheriff guards or
representatives and other deputy sheriffs who assisted him, be administratively
dealt with and removed or suspended from office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant alleges <span style="">therein </span>that he is the President of the PENTA COPYER
CORPORATION, which was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>, together with him,
Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, Benson <span class="SpellE">Pe</span>
Chua, <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Co <span class="SpellE">Sekbi</span>,
Santos Pablo, as defendants in Civil Case No. 87-39611 of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila, Branch XXVII; a writ of preliminary attachment was issued ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> by the Court; on the last working day of the week,
March 6, 1987, a three-pronged blitz was made against PENTA by a group of men
led by respondent Academia, assisted by Atty. Alex Tan, some fully-armed
members of PC-CAPCOM and other persons acting under the behest of the
“marauding party’s ringleaders”; the first group of respondent Academia pounced
upon the premises of <span class="SpellE">PENTA’s</span> main office and
thereupon caused to be levied upon and seized personal properties of PENTA; the
second group, composed of alleged deputy sheriffs of Manila, barged into <span class="SpellE">PENTA’s</span> bodega in <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>,
Manila and likewise levied upon and seized the corporation’s properties; then,
to cap the operation, respondent Academia, by and through his unnamed
assistants, likewise served notices of garnishment to several banks in Manila,
garnishing bank deposits not only of PENTA but also of the individual
stockholders/defendants in the civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant further alleges that the dispossession was done
without regard to the nature, value and quantity of <span class="SpellE">PENTA’s</span>
properties which, according to the law, should have been only for such as may
be necessary to satisfy plaintiffs’ demand; notwithstanding his sworn duty to
keep the property under his own official custody to await judgment and
execution in the action, Academia, in connivance with the plaintiffs, their
representatives and counsel, Atty. Tan, entrusted and transferred the custody
of and delivered the seized properties to the plaintiffs immediately after its
seizure on 6 March 1987; they were hauled and brought to a dilapidated bodega
with a “hole-infested r<span style="">oof”, </span>owned
by plaintiffs or persons in cahoots with plaintiffs, located at <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila, or outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the court; on 26 March 1987 the court issued an Order directing
the return of the attached properties and the recall of all notices of
garnishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the continuous
unexplained absence of Academia and the unavailability of the Presiding Judge
of the court, the Order could not be enforced, prompting defendants to file an
Urgent Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion to Appoint a Sheriff, which
was favorably acted upon by Judge <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> who appointed sheriff Rolando Mariano to implement
the release order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the bodega <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, it was
discovered that, among others, most of the seized copying machines were
cannibalized, their important parts and accessories either pilfered or
substituted with junk parts; copying machines laid bare on watery floorings,
some of the machines and parts were used as sleeping beds, dining tables and
makeshift kitchen; worse, one ISUZU KC 20 van and other units of equipment
which were seized could not be accounted for.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Resolution of <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="5">27
 May 1987</st1:date> this Court required respondents to Answer the
complaint-affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Academia filed his Answer on <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="8">28 August 1987</st1:date> denying the allegations in the
compliant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant filed a Reply to the Answer on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="9">15 September 1987</st1:date> wherein he reiterated the
charges and prayer in his complaint-affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 February 1990 We issued a resolution requiring complainant
to specifically identify the other implicated unnamed respondents <span style="">within ten </span>days from notice, and
referring the complaint against Atty. Alex Tan to the Office of the Bar
Confidant for appropriate action within thirty days and against the other
respondents to Executive Judge Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila for investigation, report and recommendation
within three months.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 April 1990 complainant filed a motion to dismiss his
complaint alleging therein that he is no longer interested in pursuing this
complaint against all respondents on the ground that the parties in Civil Case
No. 87-39611 had entered into a Compromise Agreement wherein they agreed, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, to dismiss all claims, counterclaims,
charges and countercharges against each party and their respective
counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Compromise Agreement was
made the basis of the decision of the trial court of <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="11">3 November 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="10" month="7">10 July 1990</st1:date>
Judge <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> formally transmitted his Report and
Recommendation dated <st1:date year="1990" day="21" month="6">21 June 1990</st1:date>,
pertinent portions of which read <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Respondent appeared on the date of the hearing in person without
benefit of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was advised by
the investigator that he could avail himself of the services of counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the non-appearance of the complainant,
respondent deputy sheriff stated that he was submitting the case for resolution
on the basis of his comment dated <st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="8">August
 21, 1987</st1:date> filed in this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He reiterated that the administrative case against him be dismissed for
lack of merit as he was merely performing the duties vested in his position in
carrying out the writ of attachment issued by the Regional Trial Court of
Manila, Branch 27, in Civil Case No. 87-39611, entitled Spouses Rolando V.
Mendoza, et al., Plaintiffs, versus <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation, et al., Defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1990" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1990</st1:date>,
complainant filed a motion to dismiss dated <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1990</st1:date>, praying that the above-entitled
administrative case be dismissed for the reason that the parties had settled
Civil Case No. 87-39611 by a compromise agreement filed with the court on <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1989</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Notwithstanding such motion to dismiss which was filed before the
Supreme Court, we submit that there is more than adequate basis for
administrative action to be taken against Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span>
J. Academia on the basis of indubitable facts appearing on the record which the
court may take judicial notice of and on admissions made by respondent deputy
sheriff in his comment above-mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Res</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ipsa</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitur</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<span style="">J. </span>Academia is the duly

Branch 27, qualified and performing his functions as <span style="">such:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 27, 1987, there <span style="">was </span>filed with the Regional Trial
Court of Manila a complaint for recovery of the sum of P1.5 million as
principal obligation plus unspecified amount of moral and exemplary damages and
25% of the principal obligation as attorney’s fees, entitled Spouses Rolando V.
Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> M. Mendoza, plaintiffs versus <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation and/or <span class="SpellE">Evengeline</span> (sic) A. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>,
Benson <span class="SpellE">Pe</span> Chua, Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> Co <span class="SpellE">Sekbi</span> and Santos
A. Pablo, defendants, docketed as Civil Case No. 87-39611.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned to Branch 27 presided
over by Judge Ricardo D. Diaz.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="3">March
 3, 1987</st1:date>, Judge Diaz, acting on the complaint, issued a writ of
preliminary attachment upon the filing of (sic) the plaintiffs of an attachment
bond in the amount of P1.5 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="3">March
 4, 1987</st1:date>, plaintiffs filed an attachment bond subscribed by <span class="SpellE">Interworld</span> Assurance Corporation duly approved by Judge
Diaz and on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1987</st1:date>,
the corresponding order of attachment was issued by Judge Diaz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order of attachment was addressed to
Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia, commanding him to attach the estate, real and
personal, of defendants to the value of the demand amounting to P1.5 million.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the morning of March 6, 1987, with
prepared notice of levy pursuant to a writ of attachment (already mimeographed
attachment), Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia together with a group of
men including Atty. Alex Y. Tan, counsel for plaintiffs, fully armed soldiers
of the PC/CAPCOM and policemen of the Western Police District and other men
hired by him went to the premises of <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation at its main office at 677 Carlos <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> St., San Miguel, Manila, to carry out the levy on
attachment on personal properties of defendant <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simultaneously, another group composed of other deputy sheriffs of
Manila whose identities were not revealed to complainant, but who were
admittedly acting as deputies of Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia without any express court
order, went to defendant <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span>
Corporation’s bodega in <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>, Manila, and
likewise carried out the writ of attachment against personal properties of the
defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After listing the personal properties
levied upon in the aforesaid prepared notice of levy dated March 2, 1987,
Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> J. Academia and his men
immediately seized the various personal properties in the two (2) premises,
pulled them out and boarded them into several trucks supplied by plaintiffs,
deposited them on the same day at plaintiffs’ bodega situated at <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> St., <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila under sheriff guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the personal properties seized were
several units of new Ricoh Copier machines, and included one (1) unit Isuzu KC
20 van with plate No. KPG-631 in good running condition and one (1) unit Suzuki
motorcycle, model B-120, with plate No. <span style="">1418.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>
bodega was dilapidated <span style="">and was </span>o<span style="">wned </span>by plaintiffs (sic) <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> J.
Academia even required plaintiff spouses Mendoza through their counsel, Atty.
Alex Y. Tan to acknowledge receipt of the personal properties seized from the
two (2) premises aforesaid of the defendant <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(8)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1987</st1:date>, respondent Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia
served upon several banking institutions notice of garnishment against the bank
account of defendants and worse, respondent even garnished the accounts of
stockholders of the corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(9)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even though the value of the properties
seized by Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia from defendant <span class="SpellE">Penta</span> <span class="SpellE">Copyer</span> Corporation is about
P1.8 million, which <span style="">is </span>more than
the amount sought to be recovered in the action, on March 10, 1987, at the
instance of Atty. Alex Y. Tan, counsel for plaintiffs, respondent deputy
sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J.
</span>Academia went to the address of defendant Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>
at 23 <span class="SpellE">Mabolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>,
Metro Manila, served her a copy of the writ of attachment, summons with
complaint and bond, then levied upon personal properties found inside the said
premises consisting of six (6) units of generating sets.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(10)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again, the generating sets seized from the
premises of defendant Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> were pulled
out from the said address and deposited for safekeeping at plaintiff’s bodega
situated at <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Romy</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro
Manila and turned over to the custody of the plaintiff spouses Mendoza through
lawyer Alex Y. Tan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(11)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1987</st1:date>, the court (Judge Diaz) discharged the writ of preliminary
injunction issued on <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1987</st1:date>
and ordered deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia and the plaintiffs Mendoza
to forthwith return the levied properties of the defendants and likewise set
aside the notices of garnishment issued pursuant to said writ of attachment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(12)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, due to the absence of respondent
deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia, the return of the seized <span style="">properties </span>could not be effected and the then executive judge
appointed a special sheriff in order to secure the return of the levied
properties to the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(13)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the return of the levied
properties was to be carried out, many of the seized items were missing or
parts thereof cannibalized causing substantial loss to the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is more, the Isuzu KC 20 van with plate
No. KPG 631 could no longer be located in the bodega.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This van was reported missing or <span class="SpellE">carnapped</span> to the police and constabulary authorities but
despite all efforts, the van could not be located until it was intercepted on
July 3, 1987 in front of City Bank Building, <span class="SpellE">Paseo</span> de
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, driven by a
driver of a certain Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abasolo</span>, Jr. who claimed that the vehicle <span style="">was </span>lent to his wife in June, 1987 by
her friends, a former ranking official of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of the facts disclosed above which are incontrovertible,
we are of the opinion that respondent deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span>
<span style="">J. </span>Academia is guilty of serious
misconduct in office for having acted with abuse of authority in the manner in
which the writ of attachment was carried out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, even assuming the regularity of the procedure in carrying out the
seizure of defendants’ properties in (sic) virtue of the order <span style="">of </span>attachment, respondent deputy
sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> J. Academia grossly violated the law
and the Rules of Court in carting away the seized items, boarding them in
trucks and depositing them <span style="">in </span>plaintiffs’
own bodega at <span class="SpellE">Romy</span> St. <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila, inadequately secured from
pilferage and exposed to elements in a place outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the court and the enforcing sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Academia failed to adequately
secure and <span class="SpellE">safekeep</span> the items which are very delicate
and can be easily stolen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, with
respect to the Isuzu KC 20 van, the vehicle could have been easily parked at
the parking area of the Manila Regional Trial Court and its keys kept in the
possession of the sheriff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
respondent deputy sheriff turned over to plaintiffs’ counsel possession of the
vehicle which was illegally lent to and used by unauthorized persons, and was
recovered only after about three (3) months with much effort.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What is more, respondent deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span>
J. Academia gravely abused his authority by making excessive levy on property
of the defendants, simultaneously attaching such property situated in different
places, in addition to garnishment of bank accounts, worth far in excess of
plaintiffs’ demand in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Padolina</span> vs. Henson, 173 SCRA 269).</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a deputy sheriff, respondent <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> J.
Academia has no authority without an express order of the court which issued
the writ to designate other sheriffs as his deputies in order to carry out
simultaneous seizures of defendants’ properties situated at different places
and the garnishment of defendants’ bank accounts in several banks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The seriousness of the illegal acts committed by respondent deputy
sheriff call for the imposition of the most severe penalty in the civil service
which is dismissal (sic) from the service with forfeiture of retirement rights,
if any.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, we find the respondent deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> J. Academia guilty of grave misconduct in office and
accordingly, recommend that the Supreme Court dismiss him from the service with
forfeiture of his retirement rights, if any.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In connection with the second part of the resolution dated February
14, 1990, referring the complaint against Atty. Alex Y. Tan to the Bar
Confidant for appropriate action, we respectfully recommend that the
investigation be extended to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Cristino</span> <span class="SpellE">Abasolo</span>, Jr. in whose possession the Isuzu LV (sic) 20 van,
subject of levy, was found.”</blockquote>

Regional Trial Court of Manila wherein he charges <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span>
J. Academia with dishonesty committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By failing to deposit with the Clerk of Court

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and prays that respondent be ordered
dismissed from the service with forfeiture of retirement rights, if any, and to
pay to the Clerk of Court, Regional Trial Court of Manila on account of Civil

<blockquote>“Judge Bernardo P. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>, while taking
the witness stand propounded the questions to himself and testified that he
knows respondent being one of the Deputy Sheriffs of RTC, Manila, assigned to
Branch 27; that as Executive Judge of RTC, Manila, he ordered an inventory of
the contents of the safety deposit box of the outgoing Clerk of Court Atty.
Cesar Javier who was newly appointed judge of the RTC of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>;
that among the papers he found, was PNB passbook no. 010-686608-2 marked as
Exhibit “C-1” in the name of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Manila in trust for
Branch 27, Civil Case No. 83-21859 where there was a balance of P210,000.00 on
April 27, 1984, and a withdrawal on June 6, 1984 of P50,000.00; that he asked
for the record of Civil Case No. 83-21859 and after examining the record he
discovered from the Sheriff’s Return that the actual money received by the
Deputy Sheriff as bid money was P219,023.16 but the money deposited at the PNB <span style="">was </span>only P210,000.00; that he was
convinced that on the basis of the record, there was a discrepancy in the
amount of P9,023.16 which was unaccounted for; that <span style="">in </span>the same order, he had the PNB update the bank book, Exhibit
“C-1”, and it was so updated showing a balance of P228,975.48 <span style="">as </span>of March 26, 1990 because of the
interests that had accumulated from June 6, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the last entry of the balance of
P160,000.00, the amount had increased to P228,975.48 as of March 26, 1990; that
in the same order, he required the Asst. Clerk of Court who had already taken
over the position of Clerk of Court in a temporary manner to close this account
no. 010-686608-2 in the name of the Clerk of Court, RTC, Manila in trust for Branch
27, Civil Case No. 8321859, and to transfer the balance of the account to the
Fiduciary Account of the RTC, Manila under account no. 068-576012-6; that on
July 13, 1990, he filed an administrative case against Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Marleo</span> <span style="">J. </span>Academia
for dishonesty which is now the subject of this investigation;</blockquote>

Corporation and cash in the amount of P9,023.16 as full payment of the said
bid;</blockquote>

him if he had any other evidence, he said he had none and that with the
admission of his solitary exhibit, he rested his case throwing himself to the

complained of.</blockquote>

has duly proved his case for dishonesty against the respondent beyond

realizing that the case against him is indefensible, paid the amount to the
court on <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1990</st1:date>
as shown by Official Receipt No. 1212986 (sic) for the sum of P9,023.16 marked
as Exhibit “1”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon his plea of mercy
to the Investigator, the undersigned told him that it was not in his power to
grant mercy but from the Honorable Court.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We shall decide both cases jointly.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>ADM.</u> <u>MATTER</u> <u>NO.</u> <u>P-87-72</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> correctly disregarded the
motion to dismiss on the ground that “there is more than adequate basis for
administrative action to be taken against” respondent Academia “on the basis of
indubitable facts appearing on the record which the court may take judicial
notice of and on admissions made by” him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">We </span>would go further by
saying that complaints against public officers and employees relating or
incidental to or in connection with the performance of their duties are necessarily
impressed with public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
express Constitutional mandate, a public office <span style="">is </span>a public trust (Section 1, Article XI, 1987 Constitution of
the Philippines) and the holder thereof is a servant of the people to whom he
is accountable at all times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is not
relieved of that accountability by the benevolence of a private party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a complaint for misconduct, malfeasance
or misfeasance against a public officer or employee cannot just be withdrawn at
any time by the complainant simply because he has lost interest in the
prosecution of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where, as in
the instant case, the charges are very serious and are supported by sufficient
evidence attached to the sworn complaint itself, and the complainant vigorously
reiterated such charges in his reply to the answer of the respondent, any
withdrawal or dismissal thereof upon motion of complainant would not only be
suspect but would be inimical to public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the charges are in fact true, the grant of
a motion to dismiss by complainant would hide the evil deed committed with the
disciplining authority being used <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public interest and the need to maintain the faith and confidence
of our people in the Government and its agencies and instrumentalities demand
then that proceedings in administrative cases against public officers and
employees should not be made to depend on the whims and caprices of
complainants.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a real sense, the complainants in such cases are just
witnesses, and therefore, regardless of their motions to dismiss and/or to
withdraw the complaints, the proceedings thereon may continue.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with Judge <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span> that the acts
committed by respondent Academia in relation to the execution or implementation
of the writ of preliminary attachment constituted serious misconduct in office
which would warrant the imposition of the penalty he recommended.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>ADM.</u> <u>MATTER</u> <u>NO.</u> <u>P-90-481</u></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case this Court agrees with the investigator that the
complainant has duly proved beyond reasonable doubt his case for dishonesty
against respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same act of respondent, however, also constitutes grave
misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent’s refund of the amount he misappropriated and his plea
for forgiveness are of no moment and do not serve to mitigate his
administrative liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The refund was
made only on <st1:date year="1990" day="26" month="9">26 September 1990</st1:date>,
or two days short of seven (7) months after he was ordered by complainant to
account for the amount misappropriated (Order of <st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="2">28 February 1990</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “G”) and
a little over two (2) months after complainant prepared his
letter-complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He received the amount
from the highest bidder on <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="3">7 March 1984</st1:date>
yet (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “F”).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Were it not for the extraordinary diligence and zeal of complainant
Executive Judge, the misappropriation would have remained concealed in the safe
deposit box of the Clerk of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent’s plea for forgiveness is insincere and does not
proceed from a voluntary admission that his misappropriation was “a mistake”
and from a repentant heart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea is
conditioned <span style="">on </span>a prior
determination that what he did <span style="">was “a </span>mistake”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without a tinge of sorrow and unaffected by
even a twinge of remorse, he merely nonchalantly stated:</p>

<blockquote>“If I have committed a mistake, Sir, please forgive me, anyway I
already paid the amount complained of.” (TSN, Testimony of Judge <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 28).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Yet, he ought to know from the very beginning that what he did
was not just a mistake; it was a well-planned, wrongful, and illegal act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the bid price was
P219,023.16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, only P210,000.00
thereof was covered by the Manager’s Check of RCBC, payable to the Clerk of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remaining amount of P9,023.16
was paid in cash, which respondent did not turn over to the Clerk of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No reason had been advanced as to
why the full amount of the bid price was not covered by the Manager’s
check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is logical to assume that the
splitting of the payment of the bid price into a Manager’s Check and cash was
made at the instance or upon instruction of respondent Sheriff so that, without
the slightest difficulty, he could withhold the cash and keep it for
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not have done so had
the full amount been covered by the Manager’s check.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>

<p class="BODY">The administration of justice is a sacred task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the very nature of their duties and
responsibilities, all those involved in it must faithfully adhere to, hold
inviolate, and invigorate the principle solemnly enshrined in the 1987
Constitution that a public office is a public trust; and all public officers
and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with
utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, and act with
patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Sec. 1, Article XI).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court condemns and would never countenance any conduct, act
or omission on the part of all those involved in the administration of justice
which would violate the norm of public accountability and would diminish or
even just tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Jereos</u></span><u>,</u>
<u><span style="">Jr.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Reblando</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>Sr.</u> (71 SCRA 126, 131-132), We laid down the rule that the conduct and
behavior of every one connected with an office charged with the dispensation of
justice, like the courts below, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk,
should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conduct, at all times, must not only be
characterized by propriety and decorum but above all else must be above
suspicion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, every employee of the judiciary should be an example of
integrity, uprightness and honesty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ablanida</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Intia</span>, Adm. Matter
No. R-770-P, <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1988</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts complained of in the aforesaid two cases show beyond
doubt the unfitness of respondent to continue to hold any government position. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>They are indicia of a character that resists
reform or reconstruction to meet the strict demands of a public office or
refuses to be bound by the ethical standards which public officers and
employees must uphold.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in the light of the foregoing, the Court
resolved to DISMISS respondent MARLEO J. ACADEMIA from the service for
dishonesty, grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of
the service, with forfeiture of all benefits and with prejudice to
re-employment in any branch or service of the government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Adm. Matter No. P-90-481, respondent is further ordered to pay
to the Clerk of Court of Branch 27, RTC, Manila, which the latter shall deposit
in the Fiduciary Account of the RTC of Manila (Account No. 068-576012-6), the
interests, at the legal rate, on the amount of P9,023.16 from 7 March 1984
until 25 September 1990, within ten (10) days from notice hereof.</p>
