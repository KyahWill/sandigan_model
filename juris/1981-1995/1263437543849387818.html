				<H3>ILDEFONSO ONG, COMPLAINANT, VS. MAXIMO A. MEREGILDO, DEPUTY SHERIFF OF MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 31, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Complainant Ildefonso Ong originally charged respondent Deputy
Sheriff Maximo A. Meregildo with violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. No. 3019,
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, before the Office of the
Ombudsman.  This charge was dismissed by
the Office of the Ombudsman for lack of sufficient evidence.  At the same time, the Investigating Officer
of the Office of the Ombudsman declared that the complaint was sufficient in
form and substance for purposes of initiation of an administrative
inquiry.  Thus, in April 1993, Overall
Deputy Ombudsman Francisco Villa referred to the Office of the Court
Administrator the Affidavit-Complaint of Ildefonso Ong for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 June 1993, the Court referred the Indorsement of the
Overall Deputy Ombudsman, the Affidavit-Complaint of complainant Ong and
related papers to the Executive Judge of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon
City, Judge Rose Marie Alonzo-Legasto for investigation, report and
recommendation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.3in;">The Investigating
Judge held hearings on 10, 17 and 21 September 1993, 15 October 1993 and 14
January 1994.  Both parties appeared at
these hearings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 March 1994, Judge Alonzo-Legasto submitted her Report and
Recommendation.  We find, from this
Report and Recommendation, that the following facts are substantially
undisputed:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Deputy Sheriff Maximo Meregildo was appointed by Judge
Abraham Vera of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 90, Quezon City, as Special
Sheriff to implement the Fourth Alias Writ of Demolition and Possession issued
in LRC Case No. 87-8187.  As such
Special Sheriff, respondent Meregildo advised complainant Ong, the
successor-in-interest of the judgment creditor in LRC Case No. 87-8187, that
expenses would have to be incurred in the implementation of the Writ, e.g., expenses
for transportation of laborers and policemen to the demolition site, as well as
expenses for food of the laborers and policemen and their compensation.  Respondent Sheriff advised complainant Ong
to prepare P11,000.00 as the "initial sheriff's fees and expenses."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 August 1992, respondent Deputy Sheriff received from
complainant Ong P11,000.00 in cash.  Meregildo, however, failed or was unable successfully to implement the
Writ of Demolition.  Respondent and
complainant agreed that a second attempt could and should be made to implement
the Fourth Alias Writ of Possession and Demolition, since such Fourth Writ had
not then expired.  For this second
attempt at implementation, respondent Sheriff asked complainant Ong to prepare
an amount of P10,000.00; this amount complainant Ong delivered promptly to
respondent on 27 August 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second attempt to enforce the Fourth Alias Writ of Demolition
and Possession also produced no effects.  By this time, the effectivity of the Fourth Alias Writ had expired and
the judgment creditor secured a Fifth Alias Writ of  Demolition and Possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Sheriff again asked complainant to prepare another
P10,000.00 for the enforcement of the Fifth Alias Writ.  On 17 September 1992, complainant handed
over P5,000.00 to respondent Sheriff.  Two (2) days later, on 17 September 1992, respondent Sheriff received
another P20,000.00 in cash from complainant, the complainant having been told
by respondent Sheriff that that additional sum was essential for effective implementation.  Respondent Sheriff repaired to the
demolition site with his group of laborers and policemen.  The demolition team allegedly penetrated the
barricades set up by the squatter families sought to be ejected.  However, peaceful possession of the area was
not turned over to the complainant.  According to respondent Sheriff, the Office of the Mayor of Quezon City,
or the CAPCOM, had directed the policemen to back off from the area.  Respondent alleged that the policemen left
the area and, fearing for his safety and that of his laborers, respondent and
his group of laborers followed suit.  Complainant Ong offered in evidence five (5) receipts signed by
respondent for the sums of money referred to above, including a receipt for
P1,000.00 dated 4 November 1992, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">Disappointed with the repeated failure of respondent Sheriff to
put him in peaceful possession of the premises involved despite the cumulative
amount of fees and expenses paid to the Sheriff, and doubting either the sincerity
or the ability or both of respondent to deliver possession of the premises to
complainant, complainant Ong demanded the return of the total amount of
P47,000.00 from respondent Sheriff.  Respondent Sheriff alleged that most <span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>various
sums had already been spent and offered to return an "unspent
portion" of P8,800.00.  Thereupon,
complainant Ong filed his Affidavit-Complaint with the Office of the Ombudsman
which, as noted, referred the same to this Court for appropriate administration
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Sheriff submitted to the Investigating Judge, by way
of comment on the complaint, his "Explanation" or accounting of the
monies he had received.  This
"Explanation" read, in relevant part, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x  <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The amount of P47,000.00 collected by me from Mr. Ong was properly
receipted to show that there was good faith in my intention that the said
amount would be solely spent for the costs of the implementation such as food,
costs of labor, transportation, voluntary police allowances and other
incidental expenses.  The said amount of
P47,000.00 was actually spent for the said purposes not only for the
implementation of the Fifth Alias Writ but also for the prior writ which was
the Fourth Alias Writ dated 16 June 1992.  A scrutiny of the Receipts reveal that the Receipt under date of August
21, 1992 in the amount of P11,000.00 and the Receipt under date of August 27,
1992 in the amount of P10,000.00 were spent during which the Fourth alias Writ
was still in effect and has not yet expired.  With respect to the Receipt under date of September 15, 1992, receipt
under date of September 17, 1992 and the receipt under date of November 4, 1992
were spent for the purposes during which the Fifth Alias Writ was still in effect
and has not yet expired.  Said receipts
are hereto attached and respectively marked as Annexes 'D,' 'E,' 'F,' 'G' AND
'H.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complainant, on the witness stand, controverted the
explanation rendered by respondent Sheriff.  He stated that respondent had charged him the amount of P200.00 per
laborer employed and not merely P150.00.  Complainant, who had physically accompanied respondent Sheriff to the
demolition site during the attempts to enforce the Writ, stated that respondent
Sheriff had only fifteen (15) men to a team and not thirty-five (35) or more
persons as alleged by respondent.  Moreover, complainant saw only one (1) owner-type vehicle, for the
personal use of another sheriff who was assisting respondent; complainant saw
no evidence of the three (3) or four (4) public utility jeeps respondent had
allegedly hired.  Further, complainant
claimed that he had paid for the cost of food for the policemen, over and above
the amounts he had delivered to respondent Sheriff.  Complainant's testimony in this respect follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:  What other items did you find that are not correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
the expenses of the policemen, sir, I usually pay for the food of the policemen

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words, the Sheriff did not spend this amount?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:  I did not pay for the policemen (sic) food, sir.   I usually gave him for the food of the
policemen, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
you paid the food...</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon examination of the evidence presented by the parties, the
Investigating Judge concluded that the behavior of respondent Sheriff was,
under the circumstances, highly irregular and prejudicial to the best interest
of the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Investigating Judge's view that Section 9 of
Rule 141, as amended, of the Rules of Court is applicable.  This Section reads in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.  <u>Sheriffs,

<p class="BODY">Respondent Sheriff failed grievously to comply with the above
requirements of Section 9.  Respondent
knew, or should have known, that he had to present his cost estimates for
implementation of the Writ of Demolition and Possession to the court issuing
that Writ for its approval.  He did not
do so.  Respondent Sheriff repeatedly
charged and collected from complainant sums of money without approval of the
Court; he did not deposit the sums received from complainant with the Clerk of
Court who, under Section 9, was then authorized to disburse the same to
respondent Sheriff to effect implementation of the Writ.  We note also that respondent Sheriff made no
mention in the Final Sheriff's Return which he submitted to Judge Vera, of the
amounts of monies he had received from complainant.  It does not appear that he submitted any liquidation of such
amounts to the <span style="">trial court, before the
present administrative complaint was instituted.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Sheriff attempted to defend the
"reasonableness" of the amounts he had charged and received from the
complainant, and tried to explain his repeated failure to execute the
Writ.  Respondent claimed that the Writ
of Demolition was directed against sixty (60) families, more or less, of
squatters illegally occupying the parcel of land here involved, located in
Bagong Bantay, Quezon City.  These
squatter families had refused to leave voluntarily and so had to be ejected by
force.  When respondent allegedly tried
to implement the Fourth Writ, the police contingent he had allegedly arranged
for was supposedly not dispatched by their commanding officer in view of a
heavy rain on that day.  On his alleged
second attempt to enforce the Writ, bad weather again prevented the success of
his efforts.  He assured complainant
that they would try once more as soon as the weather cleared up.  On the next attempt, he alleged that,
although prepared to demolish the structures found in the premises, he acceded
to the request of counsel of the squatters for "peaceful settlement of the
conflict."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge was not persuaded by the explanations
offered by respondent Sheriff.  Investigating Judge Alonzo-Legasto stated that the amounts charged and
collected from the complainant were exorbitant and highly disproportionate to
the actual service rendered by the laborers purportedly retained by respondent
Sheriff.  She believed that there was no
justification for employing as many as fifty (50) laborers and fifty (50)
policemen for enforcing the Writ.  The
Investigating Judge dismissed respondent Sheriff's accounting of sums received
as "too simplistic," x x x and unworthy of credence and highly <span style="">improbable."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The Court agrees with the Investigating
Judge that respondent Sheriff was dishonest in rendering his accounting of
expenses actually incurred (if any).  Respondent Sheriff's explanations are strained to an extreme; in any
case, "reasonableness" of the amounts charged and collected and
received by respondent is not a defense.  For respondent clearly ignored the procedures laid down in Section 9 of
Rule 141 of the Rules of Court.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge recommended suspension for respondent
Sheriff.  The Court, however, is
convinced that the inculpatory acts committed by respondent Sheriff are very
serious and call for a more severe penalty.  Respondent Sheriff Maximo A. Meregildo is an officer of the court.  As such, he forms an integral part of the
administration of justice, since he is called upon to serve the orders and
writs and execute all processes of the court.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> As
such, he is required to live up to strict standards of honesty and integrity in
public service.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
His conduct must at all times be characterized by honesty and openness and must
constantly be above suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Sheriff's unilaterally and repeatedly demanding sums of money from a
party-litigant purportedly to defray expenses of execution, without obtaining
the approval of the trial court for such purported expense and without
rendering to that court an accounting thereof, in effect constituted dishonesty
and extortion.  That conduct, therefore,
fell too far short of the required standards of public service.  Such conduct is threatening to the very
existence of the system of administration of justice.</p>

Section 9 of Rule 141, as amended by the Resolution of the Supreme Court <u>En

The Court notes also that the amount actually "prepared" by
complainant for respondent Sheriff, upon request or instruction of respondent
Sheriff, probably exceeded P47,000.00 and might in fact have reached as much as
P135,000.00.   The Investigating Judge,
however, interpreted her authority and commission very narrowly and refused to
inquire into additional sums allegedly given to respondent Sheriff.   See testimony of complainant Ildefonso Ong
which reads as follows:</p>
