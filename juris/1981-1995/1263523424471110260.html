<p>On March 2, 1983, petitioner filed the instant petition praying, 
among others, that the decision of respondent NTC dated November 22, 
1982 and the order dated January 14, 1983 be annulled and set aside on 
the grounds therein stated (pp. 2-19, rec.).
</p>
<p>
After the petitioner, the private respondent, and the Solicitor General 
for public respondent NTC filed their respective comments and memoranda 
(pp. 47-53, 96-106, 109-116, 127-142, 147-164, 206-221, rec.), on 
November 25, 1983, the decision sought to be reconsidered was 
promulgated, annulling and setting aside the challenged decision and 
order, respectively dated November 22, 1982 and January 14, 1983 (pp. 
225-232, rec.).
</p><p>
<em>Said decision is not unanimous as it bears the concurrence of only 9
 members of this Court, while 3 members took no part and 1 member 
reserved his vote</em> (p. 232, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated January 10, 1984 and released on January 17, 1984,
 the Court granted respondent PLDT's motion for 15-day extension from 
the expiration of the reglementary period within which to file a motion 
for reconsideration (pp. 233, 236, rec.).
</p><p>
On January 12, 1984, PLDT filed its motion for reconsideration (pp. 237-268, rec.).
</p><p>
On February 27, 1984, respondent PLDT filed a motion to admit attached 
supplemental motion for reconsideration (pp. 281-301, rec.).
</p><p>
On February 27, 1984, public respondent NTC, thru the Solicitor General,
 filed a manifestation and motion that it is joining co-respondent PLDT 
in its motion for reconsideration thereby adopting the same as its own 
(pp. 302-303, 305-306, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated March 1, 1984 and issued on March 2, 1984, the 
Court admitted the supplemental motion for reconsideration of PLDT, 
noted the manifestation and motion of the Solicitor General for and in 
behalf of respondent NTC that it is joining the motion for 
reconsideration of PLDT and adopting it as its own, and required 
petitioner to comment within 10 days from notice on the aforesaid 
supplemental motion for recon­sideration of PLDT (p. 304-A, rec.).
</p><p>
On March 28, 1984, petitioner filed its comment on respondent's motion for reconsideration (pp. 310-317, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated April 3, 1984 and issued on April 11, 1984, the 
Court denied the motion for reconsideration (p. 318-A, rec.).
</p><p>
On April 6, 1984, respondent PLDT filed a motion to strike out 
"discussion (e)" in peti­tioner's "comment on respondents' motions" 
dated March 20, 1984 (pp. 319-321, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated April 12, 1984 and issued on April 16, 1984, the 
Court required petitioner's counsel Atty. Tomas Llmas to comment within 
10 days from notice on the aforesaid motion to strike out (p. 323, 
rec.).
</p><p>
On April 17, 1984, respondent PLDT, thru counsel, filed a motion for 
leave to file within 15 days from date a second motion for 
reconsideration (pp. 324-326, rec.).
</p><p>
On April 27, 1984, petitioner filed an opposition to the aforesaid 
motion for PLDT for leave to file within 15 days to file a second motion
 for reconsideration (pp. 328-330, rec.).
</p><p>
On May 2, 1984, private respondent PLDT filed a second motion for reconsideration with an annex (pp. 332-344, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated May 8, 1984 but issued on May 11, 1984, the Court 
granted the motion of PLDT to file a second motion for reconsideration 
within 15 days from April 16, 1984, noted the opposition of petitioner 
to said motion, and required petitioner to comment within 15 days from 
notice on the aforesaid second motion for reconsideration of PLDT for 
the reconsideration of the decision of November 25, 1983 (p. 345, rec.).
</p><p>
On May 4, 1984, petitioner filed its comment on the second motion for reconsideration of private respondent (pp. 346-350, rec.).
</p><p>
In a resolution dated May 10, 1984 and issued on May 16, 1984, the Court
 required respondents to file a reply within 10 days from notice on the 
aforesaid comment of petitioner on private respondent PLDT's motion 
praying that the discussion (par. 3) in peti­tioner's comment on the 
first motion for reconsidera­tion and the supplemental motion for 
reconsideration be deleted (p. 352, rec.).
</p><p>
On May 21, 1984, public respondent NTC filed a manifestation joining 
private respondent PLDT and adopting the latter's second motion for 
reconsideration (pp. 353-354, rec.), which the Court granted in a 
resolution dated May 29, 1984 and issued on June 6, 1984 (p. 355-A).
</p><p>
On May 28, 1984, respondent PLDT filed a motion for extension of 10 days
 or until June 7, 1984 within which to submit the required reply in the 
resolution of May 10, 1984 and issued on May 16, 1984 (pp. 356-357, 
rec.), which was granted in a resolution dated June 5, 1984 and issued 
on July 3, 1984 (p. 357-A, rec.).
</p><p>
On June 1, 1984, petitioner filed its comment on PLDT's second motion 
for reconsideration, with a motion to declare final the decision with 
respect to public respondent NTC (pp. 358-362, rec.).
</p><p>
A day before June 1, 1984, or on May 31, 1984, private respondent PLDT 
filed its reply to petitioner's "comment on motion of private 
respondent" dated May 4, 1984 [motion to strike] (pp. 366-369, rec.).
</p><p>
On July 16, 1984, after its motions for exten­sion were granted, public 
respondent NTC, thru the Solicitor General, finally filed its reply (pp.
 370­-371, 372-A, 373, 375-381, rec.).
</p><p>
<em>It should be emphasized that the resolution of this Court dated 
April 3, 1984 but issued on April 11, 1984, denying the first motion for
 recon­sideration, did not state that the denial is final </em>(see p. 318-A, rec.).
</p><p>
And the motion of May 29, 1984 but filed on June 1, 1984 of petitioner 
to declare as final the decision of November 25, 1983 (which motion was 
included in plaintiff's comment on PLDT's second motion for 
reconsideration) with respect to public respondent NTC (pp. 361-362, 
rec.), was not acted upon by this Court, ostensibly because as early as 
May 21, 1984, public respondent NTC, thru the Solicitor General, filed a
 manifestation that it is joining private respondent PLDT in its second 
motion for reconsideration dated May 18, 1984 and adopting it as its own
 (pp. 353-354, rec.).
</p><p align="center"><em>
II
</em>
</p><p>
It is not disputed -- and should be emphasized -- that on August 31, 
1982, this Court set aside the NTC order dated April 14, 1982 in the 
case of Samuel Bautista vs. NTC, et al. (16 SCRA 411) <em>provisionally</em>
 approving the revised schedule of rates for the Subscriber Investments 
Plan, on the ground that there was necessity of a hearing by the 
Commission before it could have acted on the PLDT application for said 
revised schedule, to give opportunity to the public, especially herein 
petitioner and the Solicitor General, to substantiate their objections 
to the said schedule as excessive and unreasonable, especially for the 
low-income and middle-income groups, which cannot afford telephone 
connections and that there is no need to increase the rate because PLDT 
is financially sound.
</p><p>
Thereafter, in NTC Case No. 82-27 entitled "Re Philippine Long Distance 
Telephone Co.," respondent NTC conducted several hearings on PLDT's 
revised Subscriber Investments Plan schedule at which written 
oppositions were filed by herein petitioner PCFI, the Solicitor General,
 Atty. Samuel Bautista, Flora Alabanza, the municipality of Marikina, 
and the Integrated Telecommunications Suppliers' Association of the 
Philippines (ITESAP).  Other oppositors failed to file their written 
oppositions.  The hearings on the merits actually started on August 4, 
1982 and continued for four (4) subsequent dates.
</p><p>
The oppositors, thru counsel, thoroughly cross-examined the witness for 
the applicant, Mr. Romeo Sisteban, applicant's Vice-President for Budget
 and Financial Planning.
</p><p><em>
None of the oppositors opted to present evidence but merely filed 
Memoranda and thereafter manifested that the case is submitted for 
decision.  Because PLDT made some concessions in favor of the 
oppositors, oppositors ITESAP, Eastern Telecommunications, Inc., 
Philippine Global Communications, Inc. (Philcom), Globe-Mackay Cable and
 Radio Corporation (GMCR) withdrew their opposition and manifested that 
they are no longer opposing the application, after which respondent NTC 
issued the challenged decision of November 22, 1982.
</em>
</p><p>
Respondent NTC rendered the challenged decision dated November 22, 1982,
 approving the revised schedule on the ground that the rates are within 
the 50% of-cost limit provided in P.D. No. 217, that they are just and 
reasonable and in consonance with the public policies declared in said 
decree, and that such approval is in the public interest (see NTC 
decision of Nov. 22, 1982, pp. 2-19, rec.).
</p><p>
It is undisputed therefore that petitioner and the other oppositors were accorded due process.
</p><p>
From said decision dated November 22, 1982, petitioner filed the instant petition.
</p><p align="center"><em>
III
</em>
</p><p>
The decision promulgated on November 25, 1983 interprets the rule-making
 authority delegated in Section 2 of P.D. No. 217 to the then Department
 of Public Works, Transportation and Communications as <em>mandatory</em>, which construction is not supported by the actual phraseology of said Section 2, which reads thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Department of Public Works, Transportation and 
Communications, through its Board of Communications and/or appropriate 
agency <em>shall see to it that the herein declared policies</em> for the telephone industry are <em>imme­diately implemented</em> and for this purpose, <em>pertinent rules and regulations may be promulgated</em>" (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The basic canon of statutory interpretation is that the word used in the
 law must be given its ordinary meaning, unless a contrary intent is 
manifest from the law itself.  Hence, the phrase "may be promulgated" 
should not be construed to mean "shall" or "must".  It shall be 
interpreted in its ordinary sense as permissive or discretionary on the 
part of the delegate -- department or the Board of Communications then, 
now the National Telecommunications Commission -- whether or not to 
promulgate pertinent rules and regulations.  There is nothing in P.D. 
No. 217 which commands that the phrase "<em>may </em>be promulgated" should be construed as "<em>shall</em>
 be promulgated." The National Telecommunications Commission can 
function and has functioned without additional rules, aside from the 
existing Public Service Law, as amended, and the existing rules already 
issued by the Public Service Commission, as well as the 1978 rules 
issued by the Board of Communications, the immediate predecessor of 
respondent NTC.  It should be recalled that the PLDT petition for 
approval of its revised SIP schedule was filed on March 20, 1980.
</p><p>
P.D. No. 217 does not make the rules and regulations to be promulgated 
by the respondent NTC as essential to the exercise of its jurisdiction 
over applications for SIP schedules.  In Ang Tibay vs. CIR (69 Phil. 
635), this Court, through Mr. Justice Jose P. Laurel, did not include 
the promulgation of rules and regulations as among the seven (7) 
requirements of due process in quasi-judicial proceedings before a 
quasi-judicial body such as the respondent NTC.
</p><p>
What is patently mandatory on the ministry or National Telecommunications Commission is the immediate <em>implementation </em>of
 the policies declared in P.D. No. 217.  To repeat, the ministry or the 
NTC "shall see to it that the herein declared policies for the telephone
 industry are immediately implemented xx x." The formulation of rules 
and regulations is purely discretionary on the part of the delegate.
</p><p>
Both words "shall" and "may be" are employed in the lone sentence of 
Section 2 of P.D. No. 217.  This graphically demonstrates that P.D. No. 
217 preserves the distinction between their ordinary, usual or normal 
senses.
</p><p>
This is emphasized by the fact that under Section 3 of P.D. No. 217, 
only "the pertinent provisions" of the Public Service Act, as amended, 
which are in conflict with the provisions of P.D. No. 217, had been 
repealed or modified by said P.D. No. 217.
</p><p>
Section 3 of P.D. No. 217 states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The pertinent provisions of the Public Service Act, as amended, 
the franchise of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company under 
Act 3436, as amended, all existing legislative and/or municipal 
franchises and other laws, executive orders, proclamations, rules and 
regulations or parts thereof, as are in conflict with the provisions of 
this Decree are hereby repealed or modified accordingly."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And under the Public Service Act, as amended (C.A. No. 146), the Board of Communications then, now the NTC, can fix a <em>provisional </em>amount for the subscriber's investment to be effective immediately, without hearing (par. 3 of Sec. 16, C.A. 146, as amended).
</p><p>
Section 16(c) of C.A. No. 146, as amended, provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(c)  To fix and determine individual or joint rates, toll, 
charges, classifications, or schedules thereof, as well as commutation, 
mileage, kilometrage, and other special rates which shall be imposed, 
observed, and followed thereafter by any public service: <em> Provided, 
That the Commission may, in its discretion, approve rates proposed by 
public services provisionally and without necessity of any hearing; but 
it shall call a hearing there on within thirty days thereafter, upon 
publication and notice to the concerns operating in the territory 
affected:  Provided, further</em>, That in case the public service 
equipment of an operator is used principally or secondarily for the 
promotion of a private business, the net profits of said private 
business shall be considered in relation with the public service of such
 operator for the purpose of fixing the rates."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Rules of Practice and Procedures promulgated on January 25, 1978 by 
the Board of Communications, the immediate predecessor of respondent 
NTC, pursuant to Section 11 of the Public Service Act, otherwise known 
as Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended, govern the rules of practice 
and procedure before the BOC then, now respondent NTC.  Section 2 of 
said Rules defines their scope, including exempting parties from the 
application of the rules in the interest of justice and to best serve 
the public interest, and the NTC may apply such suitable procedure to 
improve the service in the transaction of public service.  Thus, Section
 2 of Rule 1 of said Rules reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 2.  Scope -- These rules govern pleadings, practice and 
procedure before the Board of Communications in all matters of hearing, 
investigation and proceedings within the jurisdiction of the Board.  
However, in the broader interest of justice and in order to best serve 
the public interest, the Board may, in any particular matter, except it 
from these rules and apply such suitable procedure to improve the 
service in the transaction of the public business."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Sections 4 and 5 of Rule 2 of said rules insure the appearance of the 
Solicitor General and other consumers or users.  The notice of hearing 
is required to be published and to be served on the affected parties by 
Section 2 of Rule 8; while Section 1 of Rule 9 allows the filing of 
written oppositions to the application.  Under Section 3 of Rule 15, the
 BOC then, now the NTC, may grant, on motion of the applicant or on its 
own initiative, provisional relief based on the pleading, supporting 
affidavits and other documents attached thereto, without prejudice to a 
final decision after completion of the hearing which shall be called 
within thirty (30) days from the grant of the provisional relief.
</p><p>
Finally, Section 1 of Rule 19 provides for the suppletory application of
 the Rules of Court governing proceedings before the Court of First 
Instance then, now the Regional Trial Courts, which are not inconsistent
 with the rules of practice and procedure promulgated by the BOC on 
January 25, 1978.
</p><p>
There is nothing in P.D. No. 217 modifying, much less repealing Section 16(c) of the Public Service Act, as amended.
</p><p>
It is true that P.D. No. 1874 promulgated on July 21, 1983 amending 
Section 2 of P.D. No. 217 expressly authorizes the National 
Telecommunications Commission (now the successor of the Board of 
Communications) to approve "such amounts for subscriber investments as 
applied for <em>provisionally </em>and without the necessity of a 
hearing; but shall call a hearing thereon within thirty (30) days 
thereafter, upon publication and notice to all parties affected." But 
such amendment merely reiterates or confirms paragraph (c) of Section 16
 of C.A. No. 146, as amended, otherwise known as the Public Service Law,
 and serves merely to clarify the seeming ambiguity of the repealing 
clause in Section 3 of P.D. No. 217 to dissipate all doubts on such 
power of the National Telecommunications Commis­sion.
</p><p>
The construction of the majority decision of November 25, 1983 of the 
word "may" to mean "shall" is too strained, if not tortured.
</p><p align="center"><em>
IV
</em>
</p><p>
WE cannot subscribe to the view that the National Telecommunications 
Commission should or must promulgate "pertinent rules and regulations"; 
because the existing substantive and procedural laws as well as the 
rules promulgated by the Public Service Commission under and pursuant to
 the Public Service Law, otherwise known as CA No. 146, as amended, are 
more than adequate to determine the reasonability of the amounts of 
investment of telephone subscribers, the viability of the company and 
the other factors that go into determining such amounts and such 
viability.  The existing laws and rules on rate-making are more than 
sufficient for a proper determination of such amounts of investments of 
individual subscribers and the profitability of the venture.
</p><p>
The adequacy of the existing Public Service Law, otherwise known as C.A.
 No. 146, as amended, and rules had been demonstrated, because they have
 been applied in the following cases involving PLDT:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.     PLDT vs. PSC, G.R. No. L-26762, Aug. 31, 1970, 34 SCRA 609;
  </p>
  <p>
    2.     Republic vs. PLDT, G.R. No. L-18841, Jan. 27, 1969, 26 SCRA 620;
  </p>
  <p> 3.     PLDT vs. PSC, G.R. Nos. L- 24198 &amp; L-24207-10, Dec. 18, 1968, 26 SCRA 427; </p>
  <p>
    4.     Republic Telephone Co. vs. PLDT, G.R. No. L-21070; PLDT vs. 
Republic Telephone Co., G.R. No. L-21075, both decided on Sept. 23, 
1968, 25 SCRA 80;
  </p>
  <p>
    5.     PLDT vs. Medina, G.R. No. L-24658, April 3, 1968, 23 SCRA 1; and
  </p>
  <p>
    6.     PLDT vs. Medina, G.R. Nos. L-24340-44, July 18, 1967, 20 SCRA 659.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As heretofore stated, as early as January 25, 1978, other pertinent 
rules of practice and procedure were promulgated by the then Board of 
Communications, now the respondent National Telecommunications 
Commission, implementing P.D. No. 217, in addition to the applicable 
provisions of the Public Service Law, as amended, and the rules 
previously issued by the Public Service Commission (Annex 2 to the Memo 
of respondent PLDT filed on August 15, 1983, pp. 147-165, rec.).
</p><p>
Even before 1978, respondent applied the procedure prescribed by the 
Public Service Law, as amended, and the rules previously issued by the 
Public Service Commission, the NTC predecessor, in several cases 
involving similar applications for SIP schedules of Filipino Telephone 
Corporation (BOC Case No. 73-064; see BOC decision in said cases dated 
December 5, 1974, May 11, 1978, March 15, 1977, Feb. 19, 1976 and Aug. 
31, 1978 - Annexes 3, 4, 4-A, 5, pp. 166-195, rec.).
</p><p>
The majority opinion recognizes that for the last three years, the PLDT 
had earned a yearly average net profit of over P100 million and the 
existing subscribers have been receiving their corresponding quarterly 
dividends on their investments.
</p><p>
It should be stressed that Section 5 of Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution, as amended, expressly directs that "the State <em>shall encourage</em>
 equity participation in public utilities by the general public".  As 
above-stated, the existing individual subscribers of PLDT had been 
sharing in the net profits of the company every quarter after the 
promulgation of P.D. 217 on June 16, 1973.
</p><p>
The amount that is provisionally approved under the subscriber's 
investment plan for PBX/PAEX trunks and for business telephones in Metro
 Manila and the provinces, whether new installations or transfers, 
appears to be reasonable, including those for the leased lines or 
outside local.
</p><p>
To lighten the burden of subscribers, investments may be paid in 
installments or under some convenient arrangements which the NTC may 
authorize, which is now expressly provided for in Section 1 of P.D. 1874
 amending Sec. 6 of P.D. 217.
</p><p>
Section 1 of P.D. 1874 directs that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 1, paragraph 6 of the Presidential Decree No. 217 is hereby amended to read as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "‘6. In any subscriber self-financing plan, the amount of 
subscriber self-financing will, in no case, exceed fifty per centum 
(50%) of the amount which results from dividing the telephone utility's 
gross investment in telephone plant in service by its number of primary 
stations in service, both as reported in the utility's latest audited 
annual report rendered to the National Telecommunications Commission; <em>PROVIDED</em>, however, <em>that
 the amount payable by the telephone subscriber may be paid on 
installment or under such payment arrangement as the National 
Telecommunications Commission may authorize</em>."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><em>
V
</em>
</p><p>
It should be likewise emphasized that pursuant to the mandate of Section
 5, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution, as amended, the law-making 
authority, in issuing both P.D. Nos. 217 and 1874, established the 
all-important policy of making available on regular and uninterrupted 
basis the telephone service because
</p><blockquote>
  <p> it is "a <em>crucial element in the conduct of business activity,</em> xx xx and is <em>essential for the smooth and efficient function of industry</em>; </p>
  <p> "xx x efficient telephone service <em>contributes</em> directly<em> to national development by facilitating trade and commerce</em>; </p>
  <p> "xx x <em>the telephone industry is one of the most highly capital intensive industries; </em></p>
  <p> "xx x <em>the telephone industry has fundamentally different 
financing characteristics from other utilities in that capital 
requirements per telephone unit installed increase as the number of 
customers serviced also increases instead of decreasing in cost per unit
 as in power and water utilities; </em></p>
  <p> "xx x <em>continued reliance on the traditional sources of capital
 funds through foreign and domestic borrowing and through public 
ownership of common capital stock will result in a high cost of capital,
 heavy cash requirements for amortization and thus eventually in higher 
effective cost of telephone service to subscribers; </em></p>
  <p> "xx x <em>the subscribers to telephone service tend to be among 
the residents of urban areas and among the relatively higher income 
segment </em>of the population; </p>
  <p> "xx x it is in the interest of the national economy <em>to encourage savings and to place these savings in productive enterprises</em>; and </p>
  <p> "xx x it is the announced policies of the government to encourage 
the spreading out of ownership in public utilities" (see Whereases of 
P.D. 217; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
P.D. No. 217 further states as the basic policies of the State 
concerning the telephone industry "in the interest of social, economic 
and general well-being of the people x x x --
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “1.     The attainment of efficient telephone service for as wide 
an area as possible at the lowest reasonable cost to the subscriber; </p>
  <p> “2.     The expansion of telephone service shall be financed 
through an optimal combination of domestic and foreign sources of 
financing and an optimal combination of debt and equity funds so as to 
minimize the aggregate cost of capital of telephone utilities; </p>
  <p> "3.     <em>Consistent with the declared policy of the State to 
attain widespread ownership of public utilities obtained from ownership 
funds shall be raised from a broad base of investors, involving as large
 a number of individual investors as may be possible; </em></p>
  <p> "4.     <em>In line with the objective of spreading ownership 
among a wide base of the people, the concept of telephone subscriber 
self-financing is hereby adopted whereby a tele­phone subscriber 
finances part of the capital investments in telephone installations 
through the purchase of stocks, whether common or preferred stock, of 
the telephone company; </em></p>
  <p> "5.     <em>As part of any subscriber self-financing plan, when 
the issuance of preferred stock is contemplated, it is required that the
 subscriber be assured, in all cases of a fixed annual income from his 
investment and that these preferred capital stocks be convertible into 
common shares, after a reasonable period and under reasonable terms, at 
the option of the preferred stockholder;</em> and </p>
  <p> "6.     In any subscriber self-financing plan, the amount of 
subscriber self-financing will, in no case, exceed fifty per centum 
(50%) of the cost of the installed telephone line, as may be determined 
from time to time by the regulatory bodies of the State."
  </p>

<p>
The same policies and objectives are sub­stantially re-stated and 
capsulized in the three Whereases of P.D. No. 1874 amending P.D. No. 217
 as pointed out in the basic policies aforestated in P.D. No. 217 that 
the cost per telephone unit increases in proportion to the increase in 
the number of customers served; and that foreign borrow­ing will impose 
heavy cash requirements for amortizations of such foreign loans which 
would result in the higher effective costs of telephone service to 
subscribers and ultimately would be a heavy drain on our dollar 
reserves, which will result in our inability to meet our other foreign 
commitments and mar the image of the Republic of the Philippines in 
international trade relations.  Thus, P.D. No. 217 stresses that in the 
interest of the national economy it is essential to encourage savings 
and to place these savings (subscriber's investments) in productive 
enterprises.
</p><p>
PLDT is profitable for the subscribers-investors as shown by its net 
profit and the dividends received quarterly by the existing subscribers.
</p><p>
There is no showing -- not even an allegation -- that the net profits 
realized by PLDT all these years have been dissipated and not plowed 
back into the firm to improve its service.
</p><p>
But the rising cost of materials and labor needed to improve the PLDT 
service, aggravated by the devaluation of our currency, all the more 
justify the revised SIP schedule approved by the respondent NTC.

<p>With the dividends that will be received quarterly under the revised 
SIP schedule, the subscribers (whether of phone installations for 
business with or without trunk lines, as well as transfers of the same; 
or of residential phones whether single or party line as well as 
transfers of the same), will recover their investments after some years 
and will thereafter remain stockholders and part-owners of PLDT.  All 
the subscribers therefore, are assured not only of profits from, but 
also preservation of, their investments, which are not donations to 
PLDT.

<p class="style4" align="center"> SEPARATE OPINION
</p><p><strong> GUTIERREZ, JR., J.: </strong>
</p><p> My concurrence in Mr. Justice Makasiar's ponencia is not without
 certain misgivings. I agree with the Court's views on the powers of the
 National Telecommunications Commission, the applicability of existing 
rules and regulations, and the policy declarations in P.D. Nos. 217 and 
1874. However, while now convinced that the increase in mandatory 
investments for subscribers is based on law and that there is no showing
 of arbitrariness in the law's implementation, I must confess that I see
 no justification for the continued inefficient services rendered by the
 respondent telephone company. When the Court was deliberating on the 
motion for reconsideration, my own residential telephone was out of 
order. And I believe that our experiences in our neighborhood do not 
represent isolated cases. I have yet to hear from or about satisfied 
PLDT customers.
</p><p> My point is -- increased rates and increases in the 
"subscribers' self-financing plan" must be matched by equivalent and 
demonstrably improved telephone services. More than its duty to increase
 rates and subscribers' fees whenever warranted, the respondent 
Commission has the statutory and greater obligation to supervise "the 
attainment of <em>efficient telephone service </em>for as wide an area as possible at the lowest reason­able cost to the subscribers."
</p><p> I am aware that almost all major components of our telephone 
system must be imported from foreign sources. Since the Philippine peso 
is now worth one American nickel, the cost of services based on imported
 materials must increase. Loans contracted when the foreign exchange 
rate was not so disadvantageous now require double or treble 
amortizations in depreciated pesos. The Court cannot assume the role of 
King Canute. Only the financial experts in the political departments can
 return the peso to a respectable value. Moreover, it is indeed to the 
nation's advantage to look for local capital sources instead of 
resorting to more foreign borrowings.
</p><p> I must stress, however, that consumers would not mind paying 
reasonable increases if they get satisfactory services. The respondent 
telephone company has yet to solve this elementary and glaringly obvious
 problem. Pinpointing the cause and applying the solution should be the 
company's number one concern.

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I vote to deny the <em>second </em>Motion for Reconsideration.  I am 
amazed that the decision which was promulgated as recently as November 
25, 1983, with no dissenting opinion to dilute its acceptability should 
now be reconsidered.  My amazement is heightened by the fact that when 
the case was discussed on July 26, 1984, I had the impression that the 
motion was doomed so that a request to defer action on it would have met
 the same fate had not the request been put on a <em>pag-bigyan </em>basis.
</p><p>
The case involves a simple problem of statutory construction -that of 
Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 217.  It reads as follows:
</p><p>
"The Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications, 
through its Board of Communications and/or appropriate agency shall see 
to it that the herein declared policies for the telephone industry are 
immediately implemented and for this purpose, pertinent rules and 
regulations may be promulgated."
</p><p>
The issue is whether or not the National Telecommunications Commission 
(NTC) must first promulgate the rules and regulations mentioned in the 
decree before it can approve the Subscriber Investment Plan (SIP) of 
private respondent Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. (PLDT).
</p><p>
The decision, without any dissenting opinion sustained the petitioner's 
contention that it is the duty of NTC to first promulgate rules and 
regulations.
</p><p>
The resolution, which is not unanimous, does not subscribe to the view 
that the NTC should or must promulgate rules and regulations because, it
 is said, the decree must be given its ordinary meaning; the word used 
is the permissive "may" and not the mandatory "shall." The non-unanimous
 resolution thus relies on the canons <em>index animi sermo est</em> (speech is the indication of intent) and <em>a verba legis non est recedendum</em> (from the words of the statute there should be no departure).
</p><p>
Any lawyer of modest sophistication knows that canons of statutory 
construction march in pairs of opposite.  Thus with the canons above 
mentioned we have the following opposite:  <em>verba intentioni, non e contra, debent inservire</em>
 (words ought to be more subservient to the intent and not the intent to
 the words).  Sutherland explains the limits of literalism thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The literal interpretation of the words of an act should not 
prevail if it creates a result contrary to the apparent intention of the
 legislature and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of a 
construction which will effectuate the legislative intention.  The 
intention prevails over the letter, and the letter must if possible be 
read so as to conform to the spirit of the act.  'While the intention of
 the legislature must be ascertained from the words used to express it, 
the manifest reason and obvious purpose of the law should not be 
sacrificed to a literal interpretation of such words.’ Thus words or 
clauses may be enlarged or restricted to harmonize with other provisions
 of an act.  The particular inquiry is not what is the abstract force of
 the words or what they may comprehend, but in what sense were they 
intended to be understood or what understanding do they convey as used 
in the particular act." (Vol. 2A Statutory Construction, pp. 65-66 
[1972].) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is an elementary rule in statutory construction that the word "may" 
in a statute is permissive while the word "shall" is mandatory.  The 
rule, however, is not absolute.  Thus Professor Luis J. Gonzaga states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "According to Black, 'Where the statute provides for the doing of 
some act which is required by justice or public duty, or where it 
invests a public body, municipality or officer with power and authority 
to take some action which concerns the public interest or rights of 
individuals, the permissive language will be construed as mandatory and 
the execution of the power may be insisted upon as a duty.' Thus, where 
the statute provided that 'the commissioners may take into consideration
 the enhanced value to the remaining land of an owner whose land was 
taken for highway purposes,' it was held that the word 'may' should be 
given a mandatory meaning and is the same as the word 'shall', since it 
directs the doing of a thing for the sake of justice or the public good.
  Similarly, a statute by which municipal corporations are 'authorized 
and empowered' to provide for the support of indigent persons within 
their limits or to make public improvements as to open and repair 
streets, remove obstructions from highways, construct sewers and the 
like, are to be construed as mandatory although they only purport to 
grant permission or authority since the public has an interest in such 
matters and the grant of authority is therefore equiva­lent to the 
imposition of duty." (Statutes and their Construction, pp. 98-99 
[1969].) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar compelling reasons dictate that the provision of the 
decree should be construed as mandatory rather than merely directory.  
They are stated in the unanimous decision as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.     P.D. 217 deals with matters so alien, innovative and 
untested such that existing substantive and procedural laws would not be
 applicable.  Thus, the Subscriber Investment Plan (SIP) was so set up 
precisely to ensure the financial viability of public telecommunications
 companies which in turn assures the enjoyment of the population at 
minimum cost the benefits of a telephone facility. </p>
  <p> "The SIP has never been contemplated prior to P.D. 217. </p>
  <p> "The existing law on the other hand, the Public Service Act, 
diametrically runs counter to the spirit and intention, if not the 
purpose of P.D. 217.  It may even be gainsaid that as long as the 
optimum number of individuals may enjoy telephone service, there is no 
limitation on the profitability of such companies.  Hence, while P.D. 
217 encourages the profitability of public telecommunication companies, 
the Public Service Act limits the same. </p>
  <p> "2.     In the absence of such rules and regulations, there is 
outright confusion among the rights of PLDT, the consumers and the 
government itself.  As may clearly be seen, how can the Decision be said
 to have assured that most of the population will enjoy telephone 
facilities?  Did the Decision likewise assure the financial viability a 
PLDT?  Was the government's duty to provide telephone service to its 
constituents subserved by the Decision?  These questions can never be 
answered unless such rules and regulations are set up. </p>
  <p> "3.     Finally, it should be emphasized that NTC is <em>estopped </em>from
 claiming that there is no need to promulgate such rules and 
regulations.  In the case of PCFI vs. NTC, G.R. No. 61892, now pending 
resolution before this Honorable Tribunal, <em>NTC totally refused to act on a petition filed by PLDT precisely for the promulgation of such rules and regulations</em>. </p>
  <p> "<em>Why then did NTC refuse to act on such petition if and when 
there is no need for the promulgation of such rules and regulations?  
After all, NTC could have simply ruled that the petition in G.R. No. 
61892 is unnecessary because such rules and regulations are also 
unnecessary</em>.  (pp. 135-136, <em>Rollo</em>)”
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above reasons also rebut the contention in the non-unanimous 
resolution that the existing substantive and procedural laws as well as 
the rules promulgated by the Public Service Commission are more than 
adequate to determine the reasonableness of the amounts of investment of
 telephone subscribers, etc.
</p><p>
The PLDT's SIP is an unreasonable imposition by a utility company on a 
captive public.  The injury is compounded by the fact that although the 
company makes mega profits its service, to use a McEnroe expression, is 
the pits.

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
RELOVA, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
For the reasons stated in my ponencia of November 25, 1983, I vote to 
DENY the second motion for reconsideration, dated May 2, 1984, filed by 
private respondent Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, through 
counsel.  The argument advanced in the motion that Presidential Decree 
No. 217 was amended by Presidential Decree No. 1874 which was issued on 
July 21, 1983, is without merit.  Section 4 of said PD 1874 specifically
 provides that "all decisions or orders of the National 
Telecommunications Commission heretofore issued approving subscribers 
investment plans or revisions thereof, are hereby declared valid and 
legal in all respects, <em>excepting such decisions or orders as, on the date of this decree, "are pending review by the Supreme Court.</em>" The case at bar was filed with this Court on March 3, 1983 or before the issuance of Presidential Decree No. 1874.
</p><p>
Besides, Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 217 which was promulgated 
on June 16, 1973 declares that "in the interest of the social, economic 
and general well being of the people, the State hereby adopts the 
following basic policies of the telephone industry:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  The attainment of efficient telephone service for as wide an area as possible <em>at the lowest reasonable cost to the subscriber</em>."

DISSENTING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
TEEHANKEE, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I join the dissents of Justices Abad Santos and Relova.  I only wish to 
add that there has been a departure here from the Court's usual practice
 and rules (cf. Rule 52, sec. 2; Rule 51, sec. 1; and Rule 56, secs. 1 
and 11) of setting the case for rehearing and hearing the parties in 
oral argument when a new majority (because of a change of votes or new 
members or for whatever reason) is inclined to reconsider and overturn 
the original majority; more so, on a second motion for reconsideration, 
the first motion for reconsideration having been denied without a 
dissenting vote and the parties not having been previously heard in oral
 argument.
