<p class="BODY">The following facts are gathered from the records of the case:</p>

<p class="BODY">The property in question was sold twice by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>, first to defendant and private respondent
herein <span class="SpellE">Cielito</span> T.

 </span>1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that
the owner's copy of the certificate of title was handed by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> to defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
as early as <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1983</st1:date>,
upon payment by <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> of the
mortgage redemption amount to a certain Atty. Oscar Reyes as part of the
purchase price of the subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deed of sale however in favor of <span class="SpellE">Cielito</span>
Santos was executed by <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> only on <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1983</st1:date>, upon payment of the
balance of the purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant
<st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> did not however register the
deed of sale w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">i</span>th the Registry
of Deeds even if he took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">possession </span>of
the subject property by his acceptance of the key to the house which he started
renovating thru the help of an architect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> requested that she be given
45 days to look for another place in which to reside and for time to remove her
personal belongings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier on <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1983</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> filed a petition for the reconstitution of her
title to the property on the alleged ground that her original title was
lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been able to obtain a
reconstituted title, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>
again sold the same property on <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1983</st1:date> to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Rhoderick</span> <span class="SpellE">Casis</span> who was able to register said sale and was able to

<p class="BODY">The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in its assailed order dated <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1983</st1:date>, declared that:</p>

<blockquote>"The <u>main</u> <u>issue</u> to be resolved in the case at
bar <u>is</u> who must be in <u>possession</u> of subject property at the
present time before the question of ownership thereof, also being contested by
the parties, is finally settled in another form.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And assuming that a determination with regard
to ownership of the property must be made incidental to the question of
possession, a reading of the pleadings in the instant case would show that what
is at issue is not who has the right to possession by virtue of being the
rightful owner of said property but merely who has the better right to possess
it at present by reason of antedating possession." (Annex "D" p.
35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) (Underscoring ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Deciding in favor of the defendant <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> reasoned thus:</p>

<blockquote>"To the mind of this Court, it is reasonable to consider
defendant to have taken possession of subject property from the time of its
sale to him on June 23, 1983, and after the key was handed over to his mother,
although Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> might have stayed there for a
little while more for the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And indicative of the fact that defendant was
then already possessor of the property in the concept of owner thereof, his
mother, according to her undisputed testimony, cause construction materials to
be brought to the place for use in renovating subject property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>
stayed for a while longer on the property or even for the whole period of 45
days as originally requested by her, for that matter - did not detract from
defendant's being the true possessor of said property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Suroza's</span>
extended stay was by mere tolerance of defendant and not by virtue of her being
the owner any longer of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>, indeed, had been occupying
the property even after being sold to defendant, how could plaintiff have
occupied it on July 21, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">July </span>22
as testified to by plaintiff's father?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, it was only by tolerance that she was able to stay since she
turned over possession and presumably ownership of the property in question
after she sold it to defendant on <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="6">June
 23, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That she executed
a deed of sale on this date is an undisputed fact."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">*</span></span></a> (p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Elucidating further, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt"> </span>in its questioned Order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1984</st1:date>, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"With the sale of the property in question in favor of the
defendant, plaintiff can have no better right of possession, and possibly
ownership, for that matter over the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It must be stressed that as early as February 10, 1983 <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> somehow already
recognized the right of ownership and possession of the defendant over the
property in issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Exhibit ‘3’ -
opposition, the certification then issued by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">her, </span>she promised that she would vacate the property not more
than forty five (45) days from February 10, 1983, adding that she would deliver
it for occupancy and possession by defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of vacating the premises in question, however, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> on <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1983</st1:date>, filed a petition for
the reconstitution of her title to the property on the alleged ground that her
original title was lost (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 27, <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="10">Oct. 21, 1983</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the facts thus established by the evidence of record,
defendant's right of possession over the property is unassailable at this point
in time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True, the sale by <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> to plaintiff had been registered and a certificate
of title had been issued in his favor, but the registration of the deed of sale
and the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in his favor in this
particular case do not in any manner vest from him any right of possession and
ownership over the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This must be so because at the time the subsequent deed of sale was
executed on July 19, 1983 by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>, she had already lost whatever right or interest she
might have had in the property by reason not only of the sale to defendant on
June 23, 1983, but also of the certification she issued on February 10, 1983 in
favor of the defendant's mother, whom she acknowledged therein as vendee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It would not be amiss to state by reference a case wherein
the Supreme Court held that between an unrecorded title of a house of a prior
date and a recorded mortgage of the same house of later date, the former is
preferred for the reason that, if the original owner had parted with his
ownership of the thing sold, then he no longer had the ownership and free
disposal of that thing so as to be able to mortgage it (Reyes v. de Leon
L-22331, June 6, 1967, 20 SCRA 369).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"True again, the act of registration shall be the operative
act that would effect the land (Sec. 50, Act 496) but this provision of law is
not for application in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>First, it is established beyond dispute that the subject property was
previously mortgage to Atty. Oscar Reyes by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage
obligation was paid by defendant's mother through Maxima Perez and by reason of
this redemption of the mortgage, a written receipt of the redemption price was
issued (Exhibit ‘1’) - opposition; certification was issued by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> in favor of the
defendant's mother wherein she acknowledged in passing the latter as vendee of
the property in question and promising to vacate in 45 days and deliver the
same to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
'3' - opposition) and a deed of sale was executed in favor of the defendant
(Exhibit '2' - opposition); Secondly, it was admitted by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> that by reason of this mortgage of her
property to the spouses Oscar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
Cecilia Reyes, she delivered her owner’s </span>duplicate copy of the transfer
certificate of title to the mortgagees as security for the mortgage
obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And finally <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Suroza</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> admitted
having filed in Court a petition for the reconstitution of her </span>owner's
duplicate copy of the transfer certificate of title on the alleged ground that
her copy was lost when the truth and in fact, she admitted having delivered it
to the mortgagees, the spouses Oscar and Cecilia Reyes which certificate of
title was in turn delivered to the defendant after the deed of sale in his
favor was executed by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After careful scrutiny of the evidence thus far adduced, this
Court cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">but </span>entertain
serious misgivings as regard <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Suroza's</span> transfer of subject property to plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It might be significant to note at this
juncture that plaintiff cannot feign ignorance of the defect in his title to
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">property, especially so since
plaintiff has failed to refute the testimony of Josefina Santos, mother of
defendant bearing on the apparent irregularity by which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">he</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">now </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claims ownership and possession of said

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The evidence on record

arguments advanced by the petitioner deal mostly on the (1) admission or
non-admission of the evidence or the factual findings and (2) the conclusions
based on these factual findings by the lower courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleges grave abuse of discretion
on the part of the respondent appellate court but failed miserably to prove
such accusation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be it noted that in dismissing the petition of the plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Casis</span>), respondent appellate court found that the denial of
injunctive relief by Judge <span class="SpellE">Natanawan</span> was premised on
his evaluation of the evidence on record which led him to certain facts and
conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, since petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casis</span> insisted that said Judge relied heavily on the
hearsay evidence of private respondent which is worthless and should not have
been admitted in the first place, respondent appellate court ruled that such
line of argument merely tends to strengthen the view that appreciation or <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span> of the evidence below is the real issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question, therefore, is factual.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled doctrine that only a question of law is
subject to review by Us, a question which does not call for an examination of

said premises is still pending, it is only fair, just and lawful to give the
