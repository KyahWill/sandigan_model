<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The trial court, in giving more weight and
credence to the dying declaration taken down by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span>
made the following observations regarding the authenticity and due execution of
the ante-mortem statement gathered by T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Acerit</span>, <u>to</u>
<u>wit</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"1. T/Sgt. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Acerit</span> under cross-<span class="SpellE">examiration</span> admitted that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">when </span>he went to the hospital to take the statement of Harry <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>, the victim was in a very, very serious condition
such that he could hardly talk and hear, repeating his questions to him before
an answer is given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under such
condition, the alleged Harry <span class="SpellE">Nicanor's</span> statement to
T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Acerit</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is
</span>unbelievable.</p>

<p class="2Q">"2. That despite victim's serious condition he was able to
write his name or sign the declaration in the presence of the two above-named
witnesses and Capt. <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged signing by the victim is
incredible, also under serious condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>victim, Harry <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> could really still sign the statement consisting of
three (3) pages, why were the first two pages left unsigned and only the last
page was signed?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This omission was not
properly explained.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"3. The fact that despite the presence of
Capt. <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span> he was not required to sign the
declaration as a witness.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead
he required other persons to sign as witnesses, why?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This question remained unanswered.</p>

<p class="2Q">"4. The fact that the defense did not at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">all </span>make any attempt to present the two
witnesses and/or Capt. <span class="SpellE">Vinluan</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">who </span>are the proper persons who could
have shed light to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">the </span>taking of
the statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">records yield no </span>explanation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">for </span>the suppression of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">their </span>testimonies.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Thus, the Court is more inclined to give credence and weight
to the declaration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>victim
before Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Paragas</span> where he affixed his right <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> as more in consonance with human experience and
habits of life than that alleged declaration of the victim where it appears he
affixed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">his </span>signature before
T/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Acerit</span> while lying on bed in a very serious
condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter situation is
