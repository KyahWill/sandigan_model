reorganized and he was phased out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
rose from Civil Engineering Aide II to Supervising City Engineer II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, for six (6) years before his
appointment </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">City Engineer, he
was a consultant with the Department of Public Works and Highways and then with
a private construction firm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1988</st1:date>,
private respondent, the incumbent Assistant City Engineer, filed a protest
against petitioner’s appointment with the Civil Service Regional Office on the
ground that he was next-in-rank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Civil Service Regional Director, in a decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1989</st1:date>, ruled against petitioner, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Civil Service Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Resolution No. 89-470, dated <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1989</st1:date>, the Commission
dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition seeking the reversal of the Commission’s
action on petitioner’s appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent filed his comment, and so did the
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked to comment, the
Solicitor General manifested that he cannot, without disregarding evidence and
jurisprudence, sustain the Commission’s position.</p>

<p class="BODY">An amended comment was filed by the Commission and its previously
filed comment was withdrawn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
filed a reply to the amended comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issues h</span>aving
been joined, the Court gave due course to the petition and considered the case
submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">At issue in this case is the extent of the City Mayor’s authority
to appoint the City Engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>when the appointee and the protestant are
both qualified for the position, <span class="GramE">may</span> the Civil Service
Commission disapprove the appointment of the former and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">order the appointment </span>of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">protestant?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioner raises as a
preliminary issue the classification of the <span class="SpellE">the</span>
position of city engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to
petitioner the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> belongs to
the non-competitive service pursuant to the city charter (Commonwealth Act No.
39) and the old Civil Service Law (Republic Act No. 2260, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>amended).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he posits, the City Mayor’s
decision to appoint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">petitioner may not </span>be
reviewed by the Commission.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Commission points out that under the Local
Government Code (Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
337) “[t]he city engineer shall be appointed by the city mayor, <u>subject</u> <u>to</u>
<u>civil</u> <u>service</u> <u>law,</u> <u>rules</u> <u>and</u> <u>regulations</u>”
[Sec. 185(1)] and that except as otherwise provided in the Code, all city
charters or parts thereof which are inconsistent with the Code are repealed or
modified accordingly [Sec. 223(1).] Moreover, the position of city engineer
belongs to the career service considering that P.D. No. 807 does not include
the position in the non-career service [<u>vide</u> <span class="SpellE">secs</span>.
5 and 6.] Thus, concludes the Commission, it may review the appointment of
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the Commission’s position well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provisions of the Local
Government Code are very clear and need not be interpreted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner’s appointment is subject to civil
service law, rules and regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And,
under the provisions of P.D. No. 807, the position belongs to the career
service.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Section 185 of the
Local Government Code provides that “[n]o person shall be appointed city
engineer unless he is a citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
of good moral character, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>licensed
civil engineer, and has been an assistant city engineer or has engaged in the
practice of his profession for at least five years.” It is not disputed that
both petitioner and private respondent are qualified for the position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Commission is of the view that it can
disapprove petitioner’s appointment and direct the appointment of private
respondent to the disputed position, considering that the latter is
next-in-rank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of its action,
the Commission cites Presidential Decree No. 807, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 19.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Recruitment</u> <u>and</u> <u>Selection</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Employees.</u></span> <span class="GramE">- <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) When a vacancy occurs in <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>position in the second level of the Career Service as defined in Section
7, the employees in the government service who occupy the next lower positions
in the occupational group under which the vacant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">position is classified and in other functionally related occupational
groups and who are competent, qualified and with the appropriate civil service
eligibility shall be considered for promotion.</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But then this is not an absolute rule, as aside from stating that
the next-in-rank shall only be <b><u>considered</u></b> for promotion, without
mandating a promotion, the same section of the decree also provides the appointing
power with several alternatives:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:0in;text-align:center;text-indent:
0in" align="center">* * *</p>

<blockquote>(5) If the vacancy is not filled by promotion <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>provided herein the same shall be
filled by transfer of present employees in the government service, by
reinstatement, by re-employment of persons separated through reduction in
force, or by appointment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">persons
with the civil service eligibility appropriate to the positions.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must again be emphasized that the power of appointment is
essentially discretionary and that the Commission cannot substitute its judgment
for that of the appointing power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Commission, under P.D. No. 807, may only approve or disapprove the appointment
after determining whether or not the appointee possesses the appropriate civil
service eligibility or the required qualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot order or direct the appointment of
a successful protestant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the
leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Luego</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Service</u>
<u>Commission</u>, G.R. No. 69137, August 5, 1986, 143 SCRA 327, the Court
said:</p>

<blockquote>Appointment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>an
essentially discretionary power and must be performed by the officer in which
it is vested according to his best lights, the only condition being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">that the appointee should possess the
qualifications required by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he
does, then the appointment cannot be faulted on the ground that there are
others better qualified </span>who should have been preferred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a political question involving
considerations<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> of wisdom which only the
appointing authority can decide.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is understandable if one is likely to be misled by the language
of Section 9(h) of Article <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">V </span>of
the Civil Service Decree because it says the Commission has the power to
“approve” and “disapprove” appointments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it is provided therein that the Commission shall have <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> the power to:</blockquote>

<blockquote>9(h) <span class="GramE"><u>Approve</u></span> <u>all</u> <u>appointments,</u>
<u>whether</u> <u>original</u> <u>or</u> <u>promotional,</u> <u>to</u> <u>positions</u>
<u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>civil</u> <u>service</u>, except those presidential
appointees, members of the Armed Forces <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of
</span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
police forces, firemen, and <span class="SpellE">jailguards</span>, and <u>disapprove</u>
<u>those</u> <u>where</u> <u>the</u> <u>appointees</u> <u>do</u> <u>not</u> <u>possess</u>
<u>appropriate</u> <u>eligibility</u> <u>or</u> <u>required qualifications.</u>
(<span class="GramE">italics</span> supplied)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, a full reading of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">rovision, especially of
the underscored parts, will make it clear that all the Commission is actually
allowed to do is check whether or not the appointee possesses the appropriate
civil service eligibility </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>required qualifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does, his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">appointment is approved; if not, it is </span>disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other criterion is permitted by law to be
employed by the Commission when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">it acts
on - or as the Decree says,” approves” or “disapproves” - an appointment made
by the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">prop</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">er</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">authorities.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Significantly, </span>the
Commission on Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Service
acknowledged </span>that both the petitioner and the private respondent were
qualified for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the position in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">c</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ontroversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That recognition alone rendered it <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> </span><u>officio</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the case and
prevented it from acting further thereon except to affirm the validity of the
petitioner’s appointment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, it
had no authority to revoke the said appointment simply because it believed that
the private respondent was better qualified for that would have constituted an
encroachment on the discretion vested solely in the city mayor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[At pp. 332-333.]</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No less emphatic was the Court in the recent case of <u>Central</u>

80455-<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">56, April </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">10, </span>1989, where it stated:</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>alleged

to effectively eliminate the appointing power’s discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At best, the circular can be considered as a
guide for the appointing power’s exercise of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, we note that the condition stated
