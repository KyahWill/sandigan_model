LUELCO through its President and Chairman of the Board insists that the bank
should follow Board Resolution No. 53-03-88, LUELCO being the owner of the
funds deposited, while on the other hand the NEA through its project supervisor
and acting general manager in the LUELCO alleges that Board Resolution No.
33-02-88 as amended by the NEA should be observed as the NEA has taken over
LUELCO and that Board Resolution No. 53-03-88 was disapproved by said general
manager pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 269, as amended by Presidential
Decree No. 1645, which empowers the NEA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">to

the NEA pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1645 is unconstitutional as it
violates the Bill of Rights, that it is an <span class="SpellE">arbritrary</span>

departments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In line with this policy,
courts indulge the presumption of constitutionality and go by the maxim that

of the LUELCO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is within the power of
control and supervision of the NEA over the LUELCO as an electric cooperative
organized and existing pursuant to Presidential Decree 269 as amended by
Presidential Decree 1645 particularly Section 5(a) thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the circumstances which, in the
interest of the cooperative and the program of electrification whereby said
Acting General Manager effectively took over the actual supervision and control
of the management and operation of the LUELCO on February 8, 1988, it was
deemed necessary that the matter of disposal of funds deposited with the FEBTC
should be guided by the NEA ruling </span>of April <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
