				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These appellate proceedings concern the president of a religious
organization (a parish council) who, over several years, admittedly solicited
and received funds for the construction of the parish church in his
neighborhood, without first securing a permit to do so from the Director of
Public Welfare (now Director of field Services, Department of Social Welfare)
as required by Act No. 4075.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
That act declares any violation of its provisions to be punishable "by
imprisonment for not more than six months or by a fine of not more than two
hundred pesos (P200.00) in the discretion of the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
And offenses so punished prescribe in four (4) years.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is admitted that the respondent, Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span>,
as president of the Parish Council of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, had been soliciting and collecting contributions
for the period from <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="7">July 4, 1971</st1:date>
to April, 1973 for the construction of the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas
Parish church; and that as of April 11, 1973, he had received donations from
different persons and companies amounting to P10<span class="GramE">,363.80</span>;
and that neither he nor the <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas Parish Council
had secured any permit to so solicit and collect contributions in accordance
with Act No. 4075.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon these facts, <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> was charged
with a violation of said Act No. 4075 in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="8">August
 23, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
docketed as Criminal Case No. 796.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that
the crime charged had already prescribed, considering that since <i><span style="">July 4, 1971­</span></i><span style=""> -- </span>when he began soliciting
contributions -- ­to <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="8"><i><span style="">August </span></i><i style="">23, </i><i><span style="">1976</span></i></st1:date><span style=""> -- </span>when the complaint was presented --
more than four (4) years had elapsed<span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
His motion was denied by the Municipal Court as was also, his motion for
reconsideration of the order of denial.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> went to the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and prayed for the issuance of
the writ of <i><span style="">certiorari </span></i>to
annul the adverse orders of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.
<span class="GramE">Tomas.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
After due proceedings, that Court rendered a decision on September 27, 1977,
granting the writ as prayed for and directing the dismissal by the Municipal
Court of Criminal Case No. 796 against <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> on
the ground that the offense charged had already prescribed.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It is this decision which the People has appealed to this Court, principally
upon the legal issue of whether or not, under the undisputed facts, the offense
imputed to <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> is indeed time-barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the People’s contention that every act of solicitation of
donations without the permit required by Act No. 4075 constitutes a complete and
separate offense; that therefore, solicitations made within four (4) years
prior to the filing of the complaint on August 21, 1976 -- specifically the
solicitations in the latter part of 1972 and in 1973, mentioned in the
complaint filed against <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> in the Municipal
Court -- could not be considered as barred by prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each act of solicitation, according to the
People, is a complete offense in itself and could not be deemed a product of
one consolidated or single criminal resolution, for the gist of the crime is
the solicitation or collection of contributions without a permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It argues that it is absurd to consider the
many acts of solicitation without a permit as only one offense, <span style="">since this would mean that future
solicitations without permit would be deemed prescribed even before their
commission, and <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span> could continue indefinitely
collecting contributions without permit without fear of prosecution, after the
lapse of four (4) years from the first collection (July 4, 1971).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even assuming the contrary, the People
submit that the prescriptive period should be reckoned only from August 18,
1976, when the lack of permit was admitted by <span class="SpellE">Kabigting</span>
during the preliminary investigation, conformably with Section 2, Act 3326, as
amended, providing that prescription begins to run from the day of the
commission of the offense, but "if the same be not known at the time, from
the discovery thereof and the institution of judicial proceedings for its
investigation and punishment."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span class="SpellE">Kabigting's</span> theory, on the other
hand, that what the law means to punish is the failure to secure a permit prior
to soliciting contributions or donations; and since the first solicitation
without permit was made on July 4, 1971, the crime was extinguished by prescription
four (4) years thereafter, or on <span style="">July
3, 1975, slightly more than a year before the filing of the complaint against
him on August 21, 1976.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the crime is made up of two (2) essential elements:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) soliciting or receiving contributions for
charitable or public welfare purposes, (b) the omission to secure a permit to
do so from the Director of Public Welfare (now Director of Field Services,
Department of Social Welfare), <span class="GramE">prior</span> to soliciting or
receiving contributions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person
intending to make such solicitations is required to first secure a permit to do
so; without that permit, he commits a crime if he solicits or receives
contributions; but obviously, if he makes no solicitation or receives no
contributions, he commits no crime even if he obtains no permit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The permit, once obtained, authorizes a
person to solicit and receive contributions for charitable or public welfare
purposes, whether from one or a thousand donors; and since plainly, the motive
for the <span class="SpellE">obtention</span> of such a permit is invariably, not
to say always, to solicit not from one donor only, or two or three, but from as
many as may be approached and importuned, it seems logical to assume that it
was not the intendment of the statute to make punishable every single act of
solicitation without permit as individual, separate crimes, a proposition
enhanced by the fact that the infringement of the statute is treated as a mere
misdemeanor or light offense, and by the familiar principle that criminal laws
should be construed in favor of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, solicitations or acceptance of donations for charitable or
public welfare purposes over a period of time, without the requisite permit to
do so, are to be deemed one offense only regardless of the number of such acts
of solicitation or acceptance of contributions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this sense, the offense is a continuing one perpetrated over a span
of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The period of its prescription
shall therefore be computed from the latest act of solicitation or acceptance
of contributions, and not from the first.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an analogous case,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
also involving breach of a special law --prohibiting the collection of
attorneys' fees in respect of claims of dependents of a deceased veteran, in
excess of the maximum prescribed by the law -- and substantially upon the same
precepts just discussed, the several, periodical acts <span style="">of </span><span style="">a </span>lawyer of
collecting fees in excess of the statutory maximum were held to constitute one
single, continuing offense, which may not be properly divided into different
segments, each segment subject to prescription independently of the others.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The challenged decision
is therefore incorrect in adjudging the period </span><span style="">of prescription </span><span style="">to have
been completed in <span class="SpellE">Kabigting's</span> favor and on that basis
directing the dismissal of the criminal prosecution against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
