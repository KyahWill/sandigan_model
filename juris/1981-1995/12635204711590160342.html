				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for <i>certiorari</i> with preliminary injunction
seeks to annul the portion of the decision of the Labor Arbiter which awards
full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to the private respondents from the
dates of their respective preventive suspensions up to the date of actual
reinstatement, as well as the decision of the respondent Commission affirming <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the Labor Arbiter's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 24, 1983, this Court issued a Temporary Restraining
Order restraining the National Labor Relations Commission from enforcing the
decision of the Labor Arbiter insofar as it requires the herein petitioner to
pay private respondents their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> but not the
order for private respondents' reinstatement to their former positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents were administratively charged with
serious misconduct for the attempted pilferage of two cases of wine from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">bonded </span>warehouse of the Philippine
Airlines on <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 11.0pt">June 12, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>After a formal investigation, the
respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">were </span>found guilty of
the administrative charge and were recommended for dismissal from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="7">July 25, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1978</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>the petitioner filed with the
Ministry of Labor and Employment an application for clearance to terminate the
services of private respondents <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Basinillo</span>, Jr., a storekeeper, and Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> and Rodolfo Salazar, Commissary <span class="SpellE">Supplymen</span>
of Catering Services of petitioner for the attempted pilferage of the two cases
of wine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents were dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a consequence, the private respondents filed a case for
illegal dismissal against the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The case was assigned for arbitration to Labor Arbiter Francisco Jose,
Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed to submit the
case for decision after submission of their respective position papers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based on the papers submitted, Labor Arbiter
Jose rendered his decision dated <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="8">August
 14, 1981</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby
rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Denying the instant Application for clearance;
and,</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Ordering respondent Philippine Airlines, Inc.
to reinstate individual complainants <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Basinillo</span>, Jr., Antonio <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> and
Rodolfo Salazar to their former positions with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from the date of their respective preventive suspension up to the date of
actual <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reins</span>tatement and without
loss of seniority rights."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed the decision of the Labor Arbiter to the
National Labor Relations Commis­sion on December 16, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 16, 1983, the National Labor Relations Commission
affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of the
Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, the petitioner
filed the present petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We consider
the comments filed by the public respondents and the private respondents as
their respective answers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Issues having
been joined, we resolve this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is no longer questioning the reinstatement of the
private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It, however,
contends that since the dismissal of the private respondents was made in good
faith and in the honest belief that the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">respondents </span>committed misconduct it should not be made to
shoulder the whole burden of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of private
respondents from the date of their respective preventive suspension up to the
date of actual reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further
argues that the long <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case is not due
to its own fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the public
respondent agrees with these conten­tions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition to be meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <u>Mercury Drug Co., Inc. v.
Court of Industrial Relations</u> (56 SCRA 694) this Court adopted the policy
of fixing the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to a just and
reasonable level without qualification and deduction to do away with the
attendant delay in awarding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> because of the
extended hearing to prove the earnings elsewhere of each and every
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of this policy, we
consistently awarded <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to the maximum of only
three (3) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People's
Bank and Trust Company, et al. v.</span> People's Bank and Trust Company
Employees Union, <span class="GramE">et</span>. al., 69 SCRA 10; Insular Life
Insurance Co., Ltd. Employees Association-NATU v. Insular Life Assurance Co.,
Ltd., 76 SCRA 50; <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>, et al. v. CIR, et al.,

et al., 81 SCRA 489; L.R. <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, Inc. v. CIR, et

Inc., 90 SCRA 391; <span class="SpellE">Litex</span> Employees Association, et
al. v. CIR, et al., 116 SCRA 459).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent case of <u>Capital Garment Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span></u> (117 SCRA 473) this Court held that "since
this case has been pending for four (4) years, we find that a period of two
years for purposes of fixing the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of
petitioner is fair and reasonable."</p>

<p class="BODY">The present case has been pending for five (5) years and four (4)
months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the reasons for the
fixing of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as indicated in the <span class="SpellE">abovecited</span> decisions and following the ruling in the <u>Capital
Garment Corporation</u> case, an award of two and one-half years of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is just and equitable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Labor Arbiter as well as of
that of the respondent Commission are hereby MODIFIED insofar as the payment of
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is concerned and the petitioner is ordered
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pay </span>the private respondents
their corresponding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for a period of two and
one-half years to be computed on the basis of their respective rate of earnings
as of July 25, 1978 without qualification and deduction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restrain­ing order issued on
August 24, 1983 is also ordered LIFTED.</p>
