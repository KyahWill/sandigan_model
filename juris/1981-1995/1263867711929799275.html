<p class="BODY">On 2 August 1980, roughly one (1) year and four (4) months prior
to the expiration of the contracts of employment, PIA through Mr. Oscar <span class="SpellE">Benares</span>, counsel for and official of the local branch of
PIA, sent separate letters both dated 1 August 1980 to private respondents <span class="SpellE">Farrales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span> advising
both that their services as flight stewardesses would be terminated
"effective 1 September 1980, conformably to clause 6 (b) of the employment
agreement [they had] executed with [PIA]".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="9">9 September 1980</st1:date>,
private respondents <span class="SpellE">Farrales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span>
jointly instituted a complaint, docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>NCR-STF-9-5151-80, for illegal dismissal and non-payment of company
benefits and bonuses, against PIA with the then Ministry of Labor and
Employment (“MOLE”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After several
unfruitful attempts at conciliation, the MOLE hearing officer Atty. Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> ordered the parties to submit their position papers
and evidence supporting their respective <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">positions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The PIA submitted its position paper,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
but no evidence, and there claimed that both private respondents were habitual
absentees; that both were in the habit of bringing in from abroad sizeable
quantities of "personal effects"; and that PIA personnel at the
Manila International Airport had been discreetly warned by customs officials to
advise private respondents to discontinue that practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PIA further claimed that the services of both
private respondents were terminated pursuant to the provisions of the
employment contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Order dated 22 January 1981, Regional Director Francisco
L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> ordered the reinstatement of private
respondents with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> or, in the
alternative, the payment to them of the amounts equivalent to their salaries
for the remainder of the fixed three-year period of their employment contracts;
the payment to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span> of on
amount equivalent to the value of a round trip ticket Manila-USA-Manila; and
payment of a bonus to each of the private respondents equivalent to their
one-month salary.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The Order stated that private respondents had attained the status of regular
employees after they had rendered more than a year of continued service; that
the stipulation limiting the period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the
employment contract to three (3) years was null and void as <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the provisions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the Labor
Code and its implementing rules and regulations on regular and casual
employment; and that the dismissal, having been carried out without the
requisite clearance from the MOLE, was illegal and entitled private respondents
to reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>an
Order dated 12 August 1982, Hon.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Vicente
<span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Jr.,
</span>Deputy Minister, MOLE, adopted the findings of fact and conclusions of
the Regional Director and affirmed the latter's award save for the portion
thereof giving PIA the option, in lieu of reinstatement, “to pay each of the
complainants [private respondents] their salaries corresponding to the
unexpired portion of the contract[s] [of employment] x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>”.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, petitioner PIA
assails the award of the Regional Director and the Order of the Deputy Minister
as having been rendered without jurisdic­tion; for having been rendered without
support in the evidence of record since, allegedly, no hearing was conducted by
the hearing officer, Atty. Jose M. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>; and for
having been issued in disregard and in violation of petitioner's rights under
the employment contracts with private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's first
contention is that the Regional Director, MOLE, had no jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the complaint initiated by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">private </span>respondents for illegal dismissal, jurisdiction over the
same being lodged in the Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations
Commission ("NLRC”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears to
us beyond dispute, however, that both at the time the complaint was initiated
in September 1980 and at the time the Orders assailed were rendered on January
1981 (by Regional Director Francisco L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>) and
August 1982 (by Deputy Minister <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Vicente </span><span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr.), the Regional Director had jurisdiction over
termination cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 278 of the Labor Code, as it then existed, forbade the
termination of the services of employees with at least one (1) year of service
without prior clearance from the Department of Labor and Employment:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 278.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Miscellaneous
Provisions</u> -- x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) With or without a collective agreement, <u>no employer may</u>
shut down his establishment or dismiss or <u>terminate the employment of
employees with at least one year of service</u> during the last two (2) years,
whether such service is continuous or broken, <u>without prior written
authority issued in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Secretary
may promulgate</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Rule XIV, Book No. 5 of the Rules and
Regulations Implement­ing the Labor Code, made clear that in case of a
termination without the necessary clearance, the Regional Director was
authorized to order the reinstatement of the employee concerned and the payment
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>; necessarily, therefore, the Regional
Director must have been given jurisdiction over such termination cases:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Shutdown
or dismissal without clearance</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>--
Any shutdown or dismissal without prior clearance shall be conclusively
presumed to be termination of employment without a just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>Regional Director shall, in such case,
order the immediate reinstatement</u> of the employee and the <u>payment of his
wages</u> from the time of the shutdown or dismissal until the time of
reinstatement." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Policy Instruction No. 14 issued by the
Secretary of Labor, dated <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="4">23 April
 1976</st1:date>, was similarly very explicit about the jurisdiction of the
Regional Director over termination of employment cases:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Under PD 850, termination case</u> -- with or without CBA
-- <u>are now placed under the original jurisdiction of the Regional Director</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Preventive suspension cases, now made
cognizable for the first time, are also placed under the Regional
Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before PD 850, termination
cases where there was a CBA were under the jurisdiction of the grievance
machinery and voluntary arbitration, while termination cases where there was no
CBA were under the jurisdiction of the Conciliation Section.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In more details, the major innovations introduced by PD 850 and its
implementing rules and regulations with respect to termination and preventive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">suspension cases are:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1. The Regional Director is now required to rule on every
application for clearance, whether there is opposition or not, within ten days
from receipt thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2. The second contention of petitioner PIA is that, even if the
Regional Director had jurisdiction, still his order <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>null and void because it had been issued in violation of
petitioner's right to procedural due process.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This claim, however, cannot be given serious consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was ordered by the Regional
Director to submit not only its position paper but also such evidence in its
favor as it might have.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner opted
to rely solely upon its position paper; we must assume it had no evidence to
sustain its assertions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, even if no
formal or oral hearing was conducted, petitioner had ample opportunity to
explain its side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner
PIA <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>able to appeal his case
to the Ministry of Labor and Employment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why petitioner's claim of denial of due
process must be rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time
the complaint was filed by private respondents on 21 September 1980 and at the
time the Regional Director issued his questioned order on 22 January 1981,
applicable regulation, as noted above, specified that a "dismissal without
prior clearance shall be <u>conclusively presumed</u> to be <u>termination</u>
of employment <u>without a just cause</u>", and the Regional Director was
required in such case to "order the immediate reinstatement of the
employee and the payment of his wages from the time of the shutdown or
dismissal until x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
reinstatement".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
under the then applicable rule, the Regional Director did not even have to
require submission of position papers by the parties in view of the conclusive
(<span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span> <u>et</u> <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span>)
character of the presumption created by such applicable law and
regulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Cebu</u></span><u>
Institute of Technology v. Minister of Labor and Employment</u>, <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court pointed out that "under Rule 14, Section 2, of the Implementing
Rules and Regulations, the termination of [an employee] which was without
previous clearance from the Ministry of Labor is conclusively presumed to be
without [just] cause x <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> [<u>a
presumption which] cannot be overturned by any contrary proof however strong</u>”.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In its third contention,
petitioner PIA invokes paragraphs 5 and 6 of its contract of employment with
private respondents <span class="SpellE">Farrales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span>,
arguing that its relationship with them was governed by the provisions of its
contract rather than by the general provisions of the Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 5 of that contract set a term of three (3) years for
that relationship, extendible by agreement between the parties; while paragraph
6 provided that, notwithstand­ing any other provision in the contract, PIA had
the right to terminate the employment agreement at any time by giving
one-month's notice to the employee or, in lieu of such notice, one-month’s
salary.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A c</span>ontract freely
entered into should, of course, be respected, as PIA argues, since a contract
is the law between the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The principle of party autonomy in contracts is not, however, an absolute
principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule in Article 1306, of
our Civil Code is that the contracting parties may establish such stipulations as
they may deem convenient "<u>provided</u> they are <u>not</u> contrary to
law, morals, good customs, public order or public policy".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, counter-balancing the principle of
autonomy of contracting parties is the equally general rule that provisions of
applicable law, especially provisions relating to matters affected with public
policy, are deemed written into the contract.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Put a little differently, the governing principle is that parties may not
contract away applicable provisions of law especially peremptory provisions
dealing with matters heavily impressed with public interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">law
</span>relating to labor and employment is clearly such an area and parties are
not at liberty to insulate themselves and their relationships from the impact
of labor laws and regulations by simply contracting with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thus necessary to appraise the
contractual provisions invoked by petitioner PIA in terms of their consistency
with applicable Philippine law and regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted earlier, both the Labor Arbiter and the Deputy Minister,
MOLE, in effect held that paragraph 5 of that employment contract was
inconsistent with Articles 280 and 281 of the Labor Code as they existed at the
time the contract of employment was entered into, and hence refused to give
effect to said paragraph 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
Articles read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 280.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Security
of Tenure</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- <u>In cases of regular
employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except
for a </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">just cause </span>or when
authorized by this Title</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement
without loss of seniority rights and to his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time
his reinstatement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 281.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Regular and
Casual Employment</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>--The provisions
of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral
agreements of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where
the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary
or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the
employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion
or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of
the employee of where the work or services to be performed is seasonal in
nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by
the proceeding paragraph:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>provided,
that, <u>any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether
such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered as regular employee</u>
with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall
continue which such actually exists." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

the Court had occasion to examine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>detail
the question of whether employment for a fixed term has been outlawed under the
above quoted provisions of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After an extensive examination of the history and development of
Articles 280 and 281, the Court reached the conclusion that a contract
providing for employment with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>fixed
period was not necessarily unlawful:</p>

<blockquote>"There can of course <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">b</span>e
no quarrel with the proposition that <u>where from the circumstances it is
apparent that periods have been imposed to preclude acquisition of <span class="SpellE">tenurial</span> security by the employee, they should be struck
down or disregarded as contrary to public policy, morals, etc</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But where no such intent to circumvent the law
is shown, or stated otherwise, where the reason for the law does not exist, e.g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">.</span>, where it is indeed the employee
himself who insists upon a period or where the nature of the engagement is such
that, without being seasonal or for a specific project, a definite date of
termination is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span><u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>, would an agreement fixing a period be
essentially evil or illicit, therefore anathema?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Would such an agreement come within the scope
of Article 280 which admittedly was enacted ‘to prevent the circumvention of
the right of the employee to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>secured
in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">* * </span>(his) employment?</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it is evident from even only the three examples already given
that <u>Article 280 of the Labor Code, under a narrow and literal
interpretation, not only fails to exhaust the gamut of employment contracts to
which the lack of a fixed period would be an anomaly, but would also appear to
restrict, without reasonable distinctions, the right of an employee to freely
stipulate with his employer the duration of his engagement, it logically follows
that such a literal interpretation should be eschewed or avoided</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law must be given reasonable
interpretation, to preclude absurdity in its application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Outlawing the whole concept of term
employment and subverting to boot the principle of freedom of contract to
remedy the evil of employers' using it as a means to prevent their employees
from obtaining security of tenure is like cutting off the nose to spite the
face or, more relevantly, curing a headache by lopping off the head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accordingly, and <u>since the entire purpose behind the development
of legislation culminating in the present Article 280 of the Labor Code clearly
appears to have been</u>, as already observed, <u>to prevent circumvention of
the employee's right to be secure in his tenure, the clause in said article</u>
indiscriminately and completely ruling out all written or oral agreements <span class="SpellE">confIicting</span> with the concept of regular employment as
defined therein <u>should be construed to refer to the substantive evil that
the Code itself has singled out:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>agreements entered into precisely to circumvent security of tenure</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should have no application to instances
where a fixed period of employment was agreed upon knowingly and voluntarily by
the parties, without any force, duress or improper pressure being brought to
bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his
consent, or where it satisfactorily appears that the employer and employee
dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance
whatever being exercised by the former over the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Unless thus limited in its purview, the
law would be made to apply to purposes other than those explicitly stated by
its framers; it thus becomes pointless and arbitrary, unjust in its effects and
apt to lead to absurd and unintended consequences</u>.” (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is apparent from <u>Brent School</u>
that the critical consider­ation is the presence or absence of a substantial
indication that the period specified in an employment agreement was designed to
circumvent the security of tenure of regular employees which is provided for in
Articles 280 and 281 of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This indication must ordinarily rest upon some aspect of the agreement
other than the mere specifica­tion of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>fixed term of the employment agreement, or upon evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span> of the intent to evade.</p>

<p class="BODY">Examining the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the employment
agreement between petitioner PIA and private respondents, we consider that
those provisions must be read together and when so read, the fixed period of
three (3) years specified in paragraph 5 will be seen to have been effectively
neutralized by the provisions of paragraph 6 of that agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 6 in effect took back from the
employee the fixed three (3)-year period ostensibly granted by paragraph 5 by
rendering such period in effect a facultative one at the option of the employer
PIA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For petitioner PIA claims to be
authorized to shorten that term, at any time and for any cause satisfactory to
itself, to a one-month period, or even less by simply paying the employee a
month's salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the net effect
of paragraphs 5 and 6 of the agreement here involved is to render the
employment of private respondents <span class="SpellE">Farrales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span> basically employment at the pleasure of petitioner
PIA, the Court considers that paragraphs 5 and 6 were intended to prevent any
security of tenure from accruing in favor of private respondents <u>even during
the limited period of three (3) years</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
and thus to escape completely the thrust of Articles 280 and 281 of the Labor
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner PIA cannot take refuge in paragraph 10 of its
employment agreement which specifies, firstly, the law of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as the applicable law of the agreement and, secondly, lays the venue for
settlement of any dispute arising out of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">or
</span>in connection with the agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"<u>only</u>
</span>[in] courts of <st1:place><st1:city>Karachi</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Pakistan</st1:country-region></st1:place>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first clause of paragraph 10 cannot be
invoked to prevent the application of Philippine labor laws and regulations to
the subject matter of this case, i.e., the employer-employee relationship
between petitioner PIA and Private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have already pointed out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that
</span>that relationship is much affected with public interest and that the otherwise
applicable Philippine laws and regulations cannot be rendered illusory by the
parties agreeing upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">some </span>other
law to govern their relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither may petitioner invoke the second clause of paragraph 10,
specifying the <st1:city><st1:place>Karachi</st1:place></st1:city> courts as
the sole venue for the settlement of disputes between the contracting
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even a cursory scrutiny of the
relevant circumstances of this case will show the multiple and substantive
contacts between Philippine law and Philippine courts, on the one hand, and the
relationship between the parties, upon the other:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the contract was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">only </span>executed in the Philippines, it was also performed here, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">at </span>least partially; private respondents
are Philippine citi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">z</span>ens and
residents, while petitioner, although a foreign corporation, is licensed to do
business (and actually doing business) and hence resident in the Philippines;
lastly, private respondents were based in the Philippines in between their
assigned flights to the Middle East and Europe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All the above contacts point to the Philippine courts and administrative
agencies as a proper forum for the resolution of contractual disputes between
the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
paragraph 10 of the employment agreement cannot be given effect so as to oust
Philippine agencies and courts of the jurisdiction vested upon them by
Philippine law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, and in any
event, the petitioner PIA did not undertake to plead and prove the contents of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
law on the matter; it must therefore be presumed that the applicable provisions
of the law of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Pakistan</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are the same as the applicable provisions of Philippine law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">We conclude that private respondents <span class="SpellE">Farrales</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Mamasig</span> were illegally dismissed and that public
