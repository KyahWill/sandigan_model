 12, 1986</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time>,
a man silently entered the house of Police Corporal Jose <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> of San Jose del Monte Police Station of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, who was then sleeping in a bed with his wife <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> and their three young children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The house was at the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> in the
Municipality of San Jose del Monte, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> and
his family were lying in bed inside their bedroom without its lights on, next
to the dining room where the light was open.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Between him and his wife in the bed was their 6-year old child, their
youngest.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The intruder tip-toed inside the bedroom and, standing just
at the foot of the bed, pointed an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle at
the sleeping police corporal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
then that his wife <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> felt the presence of someone
inside the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As soon as she opened
her eyes and saw him pointing an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> at her
husband, the gun fired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The burst drove
several bullets in the body of Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, killing
him instantly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His wife and their second
child screamed as the gunman fled from the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She kept on shouting, ‘<span class="SpellE">Dios</span>

both of whom were also of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulong</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, the latter a
co-police officer of her slain husband at the San Jose Police Station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. German was able to recover several empty
bullet shells from the scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
viewing the body of the victim and finding out from <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
the time of the incident, the two officers left, as more people arrived that
night, only to come back later on with Capt. <span class="SpellE">Eleazar</span>
Jimenez, their Station Commander, and Mayor Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Villano</span>
of San Jose del Monte.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Confused and
crying <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> was able to say that she saw her
husband's assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Capt. Jimenez,
however, told her that she had no evidence to prove what she said.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So she just talked to <span class="SpellE">Celso</span>
Reyes, her ‘<span class="SpellE">compadre</span>’ and also a police officer of
that town who advised her to seek the help of the PC CIS, instead.</blockquote>

the former police station commander of San Jose del Monte, Major Romeo <span class="SpellE">Maganto</span>, came to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>
and talked to her about the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said police major, the Chief of the Narcotics Division, Western
Police District, thereafter formed a police team for the apprehension of the

Operations Group (SOG).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that <span class="SpellE">unsworn</span> statement there was the admission by suspect <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> that he was the actual gunman who shot Police

and his implication of the other suspect <span class="SpellE">Paiona</span> (sic)

<p class="BODY">Affirming the findings of said municipal trial court in its preliminary
investigation of the case, the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court declared the extrajudicial
confession of appellant inadmissible, mainly because it was given in violation
of the constitutional requirement<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
any person under investigation must be assisted by a competent and independent
counsel, preferably of his own choice, which requirement the court noted was
not complied with when appellant was<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>put
under custodial investigation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This, however, did not prevent the court from rendering a judgment of
conviction upon reliance mainly on the forthright <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">t</span>estimony of <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>,
the victim's widow, who testified that she saw appellant shoot her husband.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

finding, appellant's brief imputes error on the trial court for not giving more

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">have seen, </span>much less to have

<p class="BODY">Firmly entrenched is the rule that conclusions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>findings of fact by the trial
court are entitled to great <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">weight </span>on
appeal and should not be disturbed, unless for strong and valid reasons,

case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to appellant’s
submission, the conclusions of the trial court are fully substantiated and
supported by the evidence on record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the lone eyewitness gave an earlier statement that
she saw but was allegedly not able to see the face of the gunman does not
destroy the fidelity of her subsequent statement taken eighteen (18) days after
the shooting where she identified the appellant as the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time the first statement was taken,
she really could not have been expected to give accurate and intelligible
answers, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">her </span>condition then
was nothing short of being in a state of mental and emotional shock considering
her traumatic experience and the <span class="SpellE">recency</span>
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A woman and a wife and mother
at that, it would too much to expect her to respond with equanimity after the
harrowing attack to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">which she and her
family had just been exposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, s</span>aid
witness <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">testified that she was then so
confused when that statement was read </span>to her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As aptly observed by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
witness, however, claims that when she was brought along to the police station
to give that statement barely five (5) hours from the time her husband was
peppered with bullets at her side lying asleep in bed with only their youngest
child between them, she was still in a confused state of mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said during the trial that she signed the
same after it was read to her, but she was not able to understand its contents
(TSN, pp. 11, 23 &amp; 24, March 19, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the trauma of that shocking experience she had just been
through, that explanation she gives is not hard to accept.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can just imagine the bloody mess
her husband had been turned into after being shot with a powerful automatic
rifle right in their bed in her stark presence before her very eyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the realization of the great danger upon
her own person and those of her young children of being themselves shot in the
same bed, must have horrified her so much.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is reasonable, therefore, not to expect her to get over it in just a
few hours and have the calm, sharpness and stability of mind to be able to relate
the incident and tell what she saw to one and all with vivid detail and
accuracy."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Besides, there is no truth to appellant's averment that the
witness never told any one of those who first came to the scene of the crime,
among them the town mayor, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Villano</span>, a fellow
officer of her husband, Corporal <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> German, the
station commander and a certain Captain Jimenez, that she saw and recognized
the gunman.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

A perusal of her testimony on cross-examination, other than the truncated
portion of her aforesaid statement to which appellant would want this Court to
focus and limit its attention, reveals otherwise, as witness this exchange on
the stand:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to you, the only question asked of
you by Cpl. German was what time did the incident occurred (sic) and they asked
you no other question even after he fetched the Station Commander.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you not volunteer to him, either German
or the Station Commander, that you saw who shot your husband?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I told the Station Commander that the

written immediately before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">word
"<span class="SpellE">namukhaan</span>" was crossed out with a series

saw the person who shot her husband but she did not know him or who he was
("<span class="SpellE">makilala</span>" or "<span class="SpellE">nakilala</span>")
