				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The rule on service of summons in this jurisdiction is too
well-known.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In-civil cases, the service
of summons on a defendant is made by handing a copy thereof to the defendant in
person, or if he refuses to receive it, by tendering it to him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Such service of summons maybe made at the defendant's dwelling house or
residence or at his office or regular place of business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The essence of personal service is the
handing or tendering of a copy of the summons to the defendant himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, when the defendant cannot be served personally within a
reasonable time, substituted service may be effected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(a) </span>by leaving copies of the summons at the defendant's dwelling
house or residence with some person of suitable age and discretion then
residing therein, or (b) by leaving the copies at defendant's office or regular
place of business with some competent person in charge thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is only when the defendant cannot be served personally within
a reasonable time that substituted service may be resorted to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The impossibility of prompt service should be
shown by stating the efforts made to find the defendant personally and the fact
that such efforts failed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This statement
should be made in the proof of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>necessary because
substituted service is in derogation of the usual method of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that this method of service
is "in derogation of the common law; it is a method extraordinary in
character, and hence may be used only as prescribed and in the circumstances
authorized by statute." Thus, under the controlling decisions, the
statutory requirements of substituted service must be followed strictly,
faithfully and fully, and any substituted service other than that authorized by
the statute is considered ineffective.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

was duly authorized to appear in behalf of the defendants, his voluntary
appearance in their behalf by the filing of the aforementioned pleadings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>the Compromise Agreement would
constitute a waiver of the defect in the service of summons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the lack of authority of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aragones</span> was revealed when he produced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the resolution </span>of the Board of
Directors of MFC to the effect <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that </span>the
authority of said counsel was in behalf of said corporation only and not in
behalf of the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the Compromise Agreement was signed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aragones</span> in behalf of the private respondents without their
authority, the same is null and void in so far as they are concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the same token, the compromise judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>also null and void as to private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ruling of the lower
court that the motion to set aside the judgment and the petition for relief
from judgment were filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An action to
declare the nullity of a void judgment does not prescribe.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">One last word, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Aragones</span> appears
to be remiss <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>his duties and
reckless in the performance of his responsibility as counsel of record in said
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He represented himself to be the
counsel for the defendants including the private respondents not only in the
motions he filed but also in the Compromise Agreement he submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the writ of execution of
the compromise judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">was </span>being
enforced that he perked up by saying that he committed an oversight and that he
was not authorized by the private respondents to represent them as counsel,
much less in the Compromise Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Candor towards the courts is a cardinal requirement of the practicing lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To say one thing today and another tomorrow
is a transgression of this imperative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel should be made to account before his peers.</p>
