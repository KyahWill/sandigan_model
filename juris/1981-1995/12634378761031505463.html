				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. 84-24144 of the Court of First Instance of
Manila, entitled “Pedro <span class="SpellE">Cutingting</span>, plaintiff versus
Alfredo Tan, defendant", the Honorable Presiding Judge Domingo <span class="SpellE">Panis</span> issued the following order:</p>

<blockquote>The Director of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is
hereby ordered to conduct an investigation with the end in view of determining
the author of the Sheriff's Return which appears to have been falsified and to
institute such criminal action as the evidence will warrant. (p. 1, Final
Report.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After conducting the necessary investigation, the National Bureau
of Investigation (NBI), through herein complainant, charged respondents, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>That sometime in May 1984 in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
at the Regional Trial Court, Branch XLI, <st1:place><st1:city>Manila</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>, the
above-named Respondents, as Counsels for PEDRO CUTINGTING in Civil Case No.
84-24144, entitled PEDRO CUTINGTING, Plaintiff vs. ALFREDO TAN, Defendant, did
then and there, knowingly, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
introduced/presented in evidence before the aforesaid Regional Trial Court, a
falsified Sheriff's Return of summons during the hearing of the aforesaid Civil
Case thereby impending and/or obstructing the speedy administration and/or
dispensation of justice, (p. 2, Final Report, ff. p. 69, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents in their respective answers denied having any hand in
the falsification of the said sheriff's return.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Rule 139-B of the Rules of Court and the resolution
of the Court En Banc of <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1988</st1:date>,
the case was referred to the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar
of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, Report, and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view, however, of the report of the National Bureau of Investigation
to the effect that the signature above the typewritten name <span class="SpellE">Florando</span>
<span class="SpellE">Umali</span> on the last page of the complaint in said civil
case is not his signature, complainant, through counsel, agreed to the
dismissal of the case with respect to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edelson</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, the IBP submitted the following report and
recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>There is ample evidence extant in the records to prove that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> has something to do with the falsification of the
Sheriff's Return on the Summons in said Civil Case No. 84-24144. </blockquote>

<blockquote>The oral and documentary evidence of the complainant strongly tend
to show the following: (1) The Sheriff's Return of the Summon in the said civil
case was falsified as it was not signed by Deputy Sheriff Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torella</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "J"
-Sworn Statement of Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Torella</span> dated <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1985</st1:date>, and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "S", which is the falsified Sheriff's
Return); (2) The summons was received from the Clerk of Court of the Manila
RTC-Branch LXI by <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> Romero, a messenger in the
law office of Attys. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span> and <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>
and said messenger brought the summons to the law office of the respondents (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "H" - <span class="SpellE">Sinumpaang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ni</span></span>
<span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> Romero, and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"G", <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "I" -Sworn Statement
dated February 28, 1985 of Mariano Villanueva, Chief Staff Asst. 2, RTC,
Manila; (3) On the basis of the falsified Sheriff's Return on the Summons,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>, counsel for the defendant [should be
plaintiff] in said civil case/ filed a typewritten Motion to Declare Defendant
in Default (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “R" - Motion To Declare
Defendant In Default in said civil case signed and filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>); (4) On March 29, 1984, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>,
in his capacity as Operations Manager of Judge <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> R.
Marcos Law Office, sent a final demand letter on Alfredo Tan, the defendant in
said civil case, for payment of the sum of P70,174.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"T" - Demand Letter dated <st1:date year="1984" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1984</st1:date> of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> addressed to
Alfredo Tan); (5) <span class="GramE">The</span> demand letter of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "T"), the
complaint in said civil case (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "Q",
"Q-1” and "Q-2”), the falsified Sheriff's Return on the Summons (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “S”), the Motion <span class="GramE">To</span> Declare
Defendant In Default dated <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="10">October
 30, 1984</st1:date> signed and filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "R" and R-1") were typed on one
and the same typewriter as shown in the Questioned Document .Report No. 198-585
dated 19 June 1985 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">“Q",
"Q-1" and "Q-2"; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"V”, "V-1" and “V-2"),</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the record of the case and the report
and recommendation of the IBP, the Court finds that respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edelson</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> committed acts
of misconduct which warrant the exercise by the Court of its disciplinary
powers. The facts, as supported by the evidence, obtaining in this<span style="">&nbsp; </span>case indubitably reveal respondent's failure
to live up to his duties as a lawyer in consonance with the strictures of the
lawyer's oath, the Code of Professional Responsibility, and the Canons of
professional Ethics. A lawyer’s responsibility to protect and advance the
interests of his client does not warrant a course of action propelled by ill
motives and malicious intentions against the other party.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it is well to stress once again that practice
of law is not a right but a privilege bestowed by the State on those who show
that they possess, and continue to possess, the qualifications required by law
for the conferment of such privilege. One of these requirements is the
observance of honesty and candor. It can not be gainsaid that candidness,
especially towards the courts, is essential for the expeditious administration
of justice. Courts are entitled to expect only complete candor and honesty from
the lawyers appearing and pleading before them. A lawyer, on the other hand,
has the fundamental duty to satisfy that expectation. It is essential that
lawyers bear in mind at all times that their first duty is not to their clients
but rather to the courts, that they are above all court officers sworn to
assist the courts in rendering justice to all and sundry, and only secondarily
are they advocates of the exclusive interests of their clients. For this
reason, he is required to swear to do no falsehood, nor consent to the doing of
any in court (Chavez vs. Viola, 196 SCRA 10 [1991]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edelson</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> has manifestly violated that part of his oath as a
lawyer that he shall not do any falsehood. He has likewise violated Rule 10.01
of the Code of Professional Responsibility which provides:</p>

<blockquote>A lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of
any in court nor shall he mislead or allow the court to be misled by any
artifice.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly; the Court resolved to impose upon Atty. <span class="SpellE">Edelson</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliva</span> the supreme penalty
of DISBARMENT. His license to practice law in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is CANCELLED and the Bar Confidant is ordered to strike out his name from the
Roll of Attorneys.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is ordered dismissed as against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Florando</span> <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>.</p>
