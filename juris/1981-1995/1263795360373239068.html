				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review and set aside
the orders of the respondent Regional Trial Court, Branch 105, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> dated - (1) <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">8 January 1987</st1:date> which rejected the
appearance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nicolito</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span>
as private prosecutor in Criminal Cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Nos. </span>Q-40909 to Q-40913 where respondent
Rosario Claudio is the accused for violation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22; and (2) 31 March 1987 which denied the
petitioner's motion for reconsideration of the order dated 8 January 1987; and
for <i>mandamus</i> to allow Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> to enter
his appearance as private prosecutor in the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
criminal cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that fifteen (15) separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
for violation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
22 or the Bouncing Checks law, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 40909 - 40913,
were filed against respondent Claudio before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and originally assigned to Branch 84.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presiding judge of Branch 84 inhibited himself when
respondent Claudio, through counsel, filed a petition for <span class="SpellE">recuse</span>
dated <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases were re-raffled and consequently assigned on <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1986</st1:date> to Branch 105 which was
then presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Johnico</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Serquina</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">During these proceedings, respondent Claudio was finally
arraigned on <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="11">November 20, 1986</st1:date>
where she pleaded not guilty to the charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pre-trial was then set on <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">January
 8, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Judge Tomas V. <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span>,
Jr. replaced Judge <span class="SpellE">Serquina</span> as presiding judge of
Branch 105.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1987</st1:date>,
the respondent court issued an order rejecting the appearance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nicolito</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Bustos</span> as private
prosecutor on the ground that the charge is for the violation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 which does not provide for any civil liability or
indemnity and hence, "it is not a crime against property but public
order."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, through counsel filed a motion for
reconsideration of the order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="1">8
 January 1987</st1:date> on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="3">March 10,
 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Claudio filed her opposition to the motion for
reconsideration on <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="3">31
 March 1987</st1:date>, the respondent court denied petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition questioning the orders of the respondent
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved is whether or not the respondent Court
acted with grave abuse of discretion or in excess of its jurisdiction in
rejecting the appearance of a private prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents make capital of the fact that Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 punishes the act
of knowingly issuing worthless checks as an offense against public order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, it is argued that it is the State
and the public that are the principal complainants and, therefore, no civil
indemnity is provided for by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 for which a private party or prosecutor may
intervene.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the petitioner, relying on the legal axiom
that "Every man criminally liable is also civilly liable," contends
that indemnity may be recovered from the offender regardless of whether or not
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 so
provides.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful study of the concept of civil liability allows a
solution to the issues in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Generally, the basis of civil liability arising from crime is the
fundamental postulate of our law that "Every man criminally liable is also
civilly liable" (Art. 100, The Revised Penal Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Underlying this legal principle is the traditional
theory that when a person commits a crime he offends two entities namely (1)
the society in which he lives in or the political entity called the State whose
law he had violated; and (2) the individual member of that society whose
person, right, honor, chastity or property was actually or directly injured or
damaged by the same punishable act or omission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, this rather broad and general provision is among the most
complex and controversial topics in criminal procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can be misleading in its implications
especially where the same act or omission may be treated as a crime in one
instance and as a tort in another or where the law allows a separate civil
action to proceed independently of the course of the criminal prosecution with
which it is intimately intertwined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Many
legal scholars treat as a misconception or fallacy the generally accepted
notion that the civil liability actually arises from the crime when, in the
ultimate analysis, it does not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While an
act or omission is felonious because it is punishable by law, it gives rise to
civil liability not so much because it is a crime but because it caused damage
to another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Viewing things
pragmatically, we can readily see that what gives rise to the civil liability
is really the obligation and the moral duty of everyone to repair or make whole
the damage caused to another by reason of his own act or omission, done
intentionally or negligently, whether or not the same be punishable by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, criminal liability
will give rise to civil liability only if the same felonious act or omission
results in damage or injury to another and is the direct and proximate cause
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Damage or injury to another is
evidently the foundation of the civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such is not the case in criminal actions for, to be criminally liable,
it is enough that the act or omission complained of is punishable, regardless
of whether or not it also causes material damage to another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Sangco</span>,
Philippine Law on Torts and Damages, 1978, Revised Edition, pp. 246-247).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Article 20 of the New
Civil Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Every person who, contrary to law, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
or negligently causes damage to <span class="GramE">another,</span> shall
indemnify the latter for the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Regardless, therefore, of whether or not
a special law so provides, indemnification of the offended party may be had on
account of the damage, loss or injury directly suffered as a consequence of the
wrongful act of another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity
which a person is sentenced to pay forms an integral part of the penalty
imposed by law for the commission of a crime (<span class="SpellE">Quemel</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 22 SCRA 44, citing <span class="SpellE">Bagtas</span> v.
Director of Prisons, 84 Phil. 692).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Every crime gives rise to a penal or criminal action for the punishment
of the guilty party, and also to civil action for the restitution of the thing,
repair of the damage, and indemnification for the losses (United States v.
Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265).</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed one cannot disregard the private party in the case at bar
who suffered the offenses committed against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only the State but the petitioner too is
entitled to relief as a member of the public which the law seeks to
protect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was assured that the checks
were good when she parted with money, property or services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She suffered with the State when the checks
bounced.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Lozano v. Hon. Martinez</u> (G.R. No. 63419, December 18,
1986) and the cases consolidated therewith, we held that "The effects of a
worthless check transcend the private interests of the parties directly
involved in the transaction and touch the interests of the community at
large." Yet, we too recognized the wrong done to the private party
defrauded when we stated therein that "The mischief it creates is <u>not
only a wrong to the payee or the holder</u>, but <u>also</u> an injury to the
public."</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil liability to the offended private party cannot thus be
denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payee of the check is
entitled to receive the payment of money for which the worthless check was
issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been caused the damage,
she is entitled to recompense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Surely, it could not have been the intendment of the framers of
Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 22 to
leave the offended private party defrauded and empty-handed by excluding the
civil liability of the offender, giving her only the remedy, which in many
cases results in a Pyrrhic victory, of having to file a separate civil
suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To do so, may leave the offended
party unable to recover even the face value of the check due her, thereby
unjustly enriching the errant drawer at the expense of the payee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The protection which the law seeks to provide
would, therefore, be brought to naught.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's intervention <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>the prosecution of Criminal Cases 40909 to 40913 is justified
not only for the protection of her interests but also in the interest of the speedy
and inexpensive administration of justice mandated by the Constitution (Section
16, Article III, Bill of Rights, Constitution of 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A separate civil action for the purpose would
only prove to be costly, burdensome, and time-consuming for both parties and
further delay the final disposition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This multiplicity of suits
must be </span>avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where
petitioner's rights may be fully adjudicated in the proceedings before the
trial court, resort to a separate action to recover civil liability is clearly
unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court is ordered to permit the
intervention of a private prosecutor in behalf of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Charmina</span> B. Banal, in the prosecution of the civil aspect
of Criminal Cases Nos. 40909 to 40913.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The temporary restraining order issued by this court on <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1987</st1:date> is lifted and the case
is remanded to the court a quo for further proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>
