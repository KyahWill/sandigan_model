				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It is a basic principle of constitutional law that the accused shall
be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and this by the most
convincing evidence constituting proof beyond reasonable ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lacking such certainty, the trial court has
the duty to render a verdict of acquittal - indeed even if the prisoner on the
dock utters not a word on his behalf - on the equally well-known precept that
the strength of the prosecution lies not in the weakness of the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution must rely on its own evidence
to prove its case and stand on its own two feet, so to speak, to sustain a
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it cannot, the charge
must be dismissed and the defendant released.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the defense offered by the accused-appellant
is alibi, one of the least persuasive of excuses known in law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We feel, however, that the evidence of the
prosecution is even less believable and has in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">fact </span>even bolstered the cause of the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>,
the herein accused-appellant, was charged with the murder of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, Sr., allegedly committed in the early morning of <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1985</st1:date>, at the <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place> abattoir in <span class="SpellE">Kinamaligan</span>,

Judge <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> Z. Angeles of the Regional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Trial </span>Court of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>
and sentenced to death, besides being subjected to certain pecuniary
liabilities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

His case was elevated to the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>automatic
review because of the penalty, which, however, is no longer imposable under the
present Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case is now
treated as an ordinary appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also settled is the rule that the factual findings of the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court </span>should be accorded the highest
respect by the appellate court because of the opportunity enjoyed by the former
to observe the demeanor of the witnesses on the stand and assess their
testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the higher
court is not entirely precluded from reviewing and reversing these findings if
it is not convinced that they are conformable to the evidence of record and to
its own impressions of the credibility of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court on the basis of the evidence of the
prosecution, the accused-appellant met Arturo <span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span>
at about two o'clock of the morning in question on the way to the <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> abattoir and decided to accompany him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before entering the slaughterhouse, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> noticed a person <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">lying </span>near the wall of the building and asked <span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span> to find out who it was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span> did so
and informed <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> that the sleeping man was
Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, Sr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the spur of the moment, it would seem <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
then pulled a .45 caliber pistol from his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">w</span>aist,
approached <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> and shot him in the
forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span>
fled in fear into the slaughterhouse.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Inside the slaughterhouse, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>,
Jr. heard the shot and went outside to investigate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He came out in time to see a fat man scaling
the wire fence and wearing a red striped black T-shirt, denim trousers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>white rubber shoes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The witness later identified the man as <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, the herein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused-appellant.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, near a cafeteria some two hundred meters away, PC Sergeant Cesar
Ramirez also heard the shot and rushed toward the direction of the sound with
drawn service pistol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way, he met
the accused-appellant who was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">running
fast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Ramirez did not detain <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> even when he asked him why he was running and the
latter did not answer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On arrival at the
abattoir, Ramirez inquired about the shot he had heard but no one gave any
explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Informed that Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, Sr. had not yet butchered his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>,
Ramirez asked <span class="SpellE">Ompoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>
to wake him up, but the latter returned a few minutes later to report that <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> could not be roused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two of them went to the cafeteria to
drink coffee </span>and, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">after an hour,
Ramirez again asked <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> to wake up <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time,
<span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> came back with the shouted report that <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> was dead with a bullet in his head.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1985</st1:date>,
the accused-appellant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>apprehended
and investigated for the offense, and on <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1985</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">an information</span> was
filed against him for the murder of Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>,
Sr.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> claimed that
he was in <span class="SpellE">Bulan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
at the time of the commission of the offense and was accompanied by Federico
Chua,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
who corroborated his testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It has already been remarked that alibi is a rather weak defense;
but as also earlier observed, the verdict on the accused must depend on the
strength not of the defense but of the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is to say that even if the defense may
be weak (which is not so declared <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the
present case), the prosecution must still fail if it is even weaker, or at
least not strong enough to support <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And that is precisely what it is in the case at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court described <span class="SpellE">Deocariza's</span>
testimony as "straightforward, clear, sincere and convincing," but
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>probably true insofar as
its delivery in court was concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">intrinsic</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> </span>credibility of the testimony itself
is another matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One finds it
difficult to accept that the offense was committed only because of the
happenstance that <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> chanced upon <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> while the latter was asleep that morning of <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then and there it occurred to the
accused-appellant to murder the victim, which he did without much ado.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No less remarkably, <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
was apparently not bothered that there was a witness to the deed - <span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>ignored
completely as if he never existed at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And to make matters less credible, <span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span>
said absolutely nothing when Ramirez arrived on the scene and started asking
questions; and even later, after his initial shock and fear had dissipated, this
alleged eyewitness persisted on keeping silent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only thirteen days later that he supposedly revealed all to the
fiscal,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
who prepared an affidavit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">for </span>him
to sign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not do this right
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it took another
twenty-five days before he decided to affix his signature <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to </span>the statement,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
which, to compound the confusion, he later retracted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ramirez is no less convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He says he rushed with gun drawn toward the direction of the shot when
he heard it but made no move to stop the accused-appellant when he saw <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> running <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">away</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>from such direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The running man should have excited the
suspicion of Ramirez, who was a peace officer trained in the apprehension of
criminals and fugitives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he did nothing
to intercept or detain <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramirez said he stopped but the other man
continued running fast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramirez says he
recognized <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> "because of his
attire" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(as</span> if to suggest
that the man had a distinctive manner of clothing), and when having passed him,
<span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> turned back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ramirez said he could recognize <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> because of the light from the Shell station which
presumably illuminated the latter's face.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the defense established through <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lustacio</span>, that the <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>
Electric Cooperative turns off all electric power at 11 o'clock in the evening,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
(another witness, Rolando <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span>, said it was at
midnight<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In either case, this would mean that the
Shell station could not have been lit at <st1:time minute="30" hour="1">1:30
 a.m.</st1:time> when Ramirez claimed to have met and identified the running <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Jesus <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>, Jr., he says
that there were about fifteen persons in the abattoir when the shot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>heard,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
but only he was curious enough to go out and find out what it was all about.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one else accompanied him although the shot
was an unusual occurrence during that quiet morning, alarming enough to make
Sergeant Ramirez immediately start running fast toward the abattoir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jesus says he came out just in time to see <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> clambering up the wire fence and could recognize
the man despite the poor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">light </span>and
the further fact that what he could have seen was the man's <u>back</u> and not
his face as he was escaping <u>away</u> from the enclosure of the
abattoir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And why was the man scaling
the wire fence when there was an <u>open</u> gate not less than eight meters
away?<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">Jesus says </span><span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
probably did not want to be seen, but that was hardly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">a </span>necessary precaution, considering that <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>,
if the prosecution theory is to be accepted, did not mind being seen at all by <span class="SpellE">Deocariza</span> when he actually shot <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span>
to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Jesus says that only
he went out of the abattoir when they heard the shot, which would mean that
there were at the time no witnesses to fear who would see <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>
fleeing by the gate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">It </span>is no less
remarkable that upon his return to the slaughterhouse, Jesus made no mention of
the fleeing person nor did any one of the fourteen people inside ask him what
he had seen outside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And most important
of all, it never occurred to Jesus - considering the shot and the fleeing man -
to see if his father, who was supposed to be sleeping nearby, was all right.</p>

<p class="BODY">The physical evidence against the accused-appellant is also
deficient and unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The gun
supposedly used by the accused-appellant was never produced in evidence nor is
there any showing that <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> had fired a gun at
all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
The prosecution made much of the rubber shoes the gunman was supposed to have
been wearing, but there were no footprints to connect <span class="SpellE">Macasinag's</span>
own shoes to the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution simply said that the footprints had been obliterated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The shoes themselves are not distinctive - they are just like any ordinary pair
of rubber shoes worn by any number of persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So too are the rest of <span class="SpellE">Macasinag's</span> attire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The red striped black T-shirt and the denim
pants could have been used by any other man and cannot be related exclusively
to <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unless this was <span class="SpellE">Macasinag's</span> customary costume
- and we find no proof of this - there is no reason to believe Ramirez's
statement that he also recognized <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> by his
attire.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court might have been influenced by the killing of a
prospective witness for the prosecution and the suspicion that the
accused-appellant was responsible <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he does not stand accused here of that
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is entirely irrelevant to
this case no matter what sinister conjectures may be conjured against <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is possible that <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span> did
really kill <span class="SpellE">Matienzo</span> but the evidence of the
prosecution is simply inadequate to warrant a conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such conviction must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">be supported by proof beyond reasonable doubt, which is absent in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be supposed that the
accused-appellant's alibi is not worthy of credence, the fact is that the
evidence of the prosecution is much less so, with all its improbabilities and
inconsistencies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court will not
deprive a person of his liberty and stigmatize him as a killer as long as it is
not morally certain he has indeed committed the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The guilty must be
punished, to be sure, but only if it is </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
