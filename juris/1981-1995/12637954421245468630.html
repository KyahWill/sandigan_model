holding the hands of his brother Reynaldo Bautista, and simultaneous thereto, he 
saw <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr., 
successively stab Reynaldo Bautista in different parts of his body (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., pp. 10-11,<em> ibid</em>.).<span>&nbsp; </span>As he

Honorable Court, the above-named accused FAUSTO MANANSALA, JR. (at large), 
RODANTE BAUTISTA and MARCIANO MANUYAG, conspiring, confederating together and 
mutually helping one another, and armed with a knife, did then and there 
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with deliberate intent to kill, attack and 
wound therewith REYNALDO BAUTISTA in the different parts of the body, inflicting

Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span>, which directly caused the death of said Reynaldo

<blockquote>"All contrary to law, and with the qualifying circumstance of <span class="SpellE">alevosia</span> and the generic aggravating circumstance of 
premeditation."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">But, only <span class="SpellE">Rodante</span> Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span> who both entered 
a plea of not <span class="GramE">guilty,</span> were arraigned, as <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. has not been

guilty of the crime charged and sentenced as aforesaid.<span>&nbsp; </span>From this 
judgment, both appealed to <span class="GramE">Us</span>, upon the following 
assignment of errors —</p>
<p style="margin: 15pt 0in;" class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN GIVING MUCH WEIGHT TO THE TESTIMONIES OF

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN DISREGARDING THE TESTIMONIES OF

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT GIVING WEIGHT TO THE EXCULPATORY

<p style="margin: 15pt 0in;" class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THERE EXISTED A CONSPIRACY

IMPRISONMENT AND TO INDEMNIFY THE HEIRS OF THE DECEASED IN THE AMOUNT OF 
P108,907.00 AND TO PAY THE COSTS.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Both the prosecution and the defense agree on one point — the fact 
of death of Reynaldo Bautista.<span>&nbsp; </span>The disagreement lies in the fact 
that while the prosecution wanted to establish, and in fact did establish to the 
satisfaction of the trial court that herein appellants conspired and 
confederated with <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. in killing Reynaldo Bautista, the defense 
wanted to establish that it was only <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. who inflicted the fatal wounds on the 
victim.</p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, both appellants testified that at about 6:00 o'clock in the 
evening of December 6, 1982, they already left the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. with accused 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. and the victim Reynaldo Bautista, still 
drinking gin; that they proceeded to their respective houses to join their 
family, where they rested until they were awakened by <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Isip</span> who took them away for protective custody.</p>
<p class="BODY">To corroborate their testimony on this point, appellants presented 
<span class="SpellE">Amalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, a 
sister-in-law of accused <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span>, who testified that on her way to buy cigarettes 
from the store of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> Bautista, and at a distance of 
about 3 to 4 meters from the house of accused <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr., she saw accused <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. stabbing the 
victim Reynaldo Bautista in an almost kneeling position with the victim lying on 
his <span>back on the floor; that aside from the two, she did not see any other 
person inside the house of the accused <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. 
at that time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The main thrust of appellants' assignment of errors is against the 
credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, <span class="GramE">We</span> have carefully examined the records of the case and We 
find no ground to alter the trial court's appreciation of the credibility of the 
witnesses for the prosecution, particularly that of Roberto Bautista, simply 
because he is the brother of the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Relationship of the 
witness with the victim does not impair his credibility (<em>People vs. 
Surban</em>, 123 SCRA 218; <em>People vs. </em><span class="SpellE"><em>Oquiño</em></span>, 122 SCRA 797).<span>&nbsp; </span>As aptly held 
by the trial court —</p>
<blockquote>"The fact that prosecution witness Roberto Bautista is a brother of 
the victim Reynaldo Bautista will not automatically disqualify him as a credible 
witness, especially as in this case where the testimony is supported by 
corroborative evidence, such as Exhibit "A-5", which is the picture taken upon 
instruction of<span> Police Sgt. Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span> of the 
<span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> INP showing the rice paddy where the body of 
the victim Reynaldo Bautista was dumped or where it fell down after the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Rodante</span> Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span> released it when 
they saw Roberto Bautista approaching them.<span>&nbsp; </span>This picture, Exhibit 
"A-5" was identified by both prosecution and defense witnesses.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Depicted in the picture is a portion of a rice paddy along what appears 
to be a barrio road with standing <span class="SpellE">palay</span> crop and with 
the shape or contour of a human body dropped or dumped thereon, causing the 
<span class="SpellE">palay</span> crops to be crumpled on the mud, Exhibit "A-1" 
is another picture taken upon instruction of the police investigator duly 
identified in the course of the trial by other prosecution and defense 
witnesses, showing the victim Reynaldo Bautista with mud and dirt on his 
extremities, apparently retrieved from the rice paddy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pictures 
speak a thousand <span class="GramE">words,</span> corroborate the testimony of 
prosecution witness Roberto Bautista and to overcome the charge of the defense 
that he is a biased witness, being a brother of the victim." </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">While there may be some contradictions and inconsistencies in 
statements of the witnesses for the prosecution, the discrepancies refer to 
minor or trivial details which cannot destroy the probative value of the entire 
testimony of the said witnesses.<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot <span>ex</span>pect 
absolute uniformity in every detail because witnesses react differently to what 
they see and hear, depending upon their situation and state of mind.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Complete uniformity in details is a badge of untruthfulness.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The slight contradictions, on the other hand, strengthen the sincerity of 
the testimony of the witness.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>People vs. Pelias Jones</em>, 
137 SCRA 166; <em>People vs. Pacabes</em>, 137 SCRA 158; <em>People vs. 
Agudo</em>, 137 SCRA 516)</p>
<p class="BODY">It is settled that when the issue is one of credibility of 
witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the lower 
court, considering that it is in a better position to decide the question, 
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their depo<span>r</span>tment 
and manner of testifying during the trial unless it has plainly overlooked 
certain facts of substance and value, that, if considered, might affect the 
result of the case.<span> </span>(<em>People vs. Tuscano</em>, 137 SCRA 203; 
<em>People vs. Millarpe</em>, 134 SCRA 555; <em>People vs. Alison</em>, 122 SCRA 
9)</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, We are convinced, after a review of the 
evidence on record, that the trial court has not overlooked any fact of 
substance and value which if considered might affect the result of the 
case.<span>&nbsp; </span>We therefore uphold the following findings and conclusions 
of the trial court —</p>
<blockquote>"As alleged in the information, the accused are being charged for 
Murder from the stabbing by accused <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, <span>Jr. </span>of the accused (sic) Reynaldo 
Bautista while the latter was being held by the two other accused <span class="SpellE">Rodante</span> Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span> which directly caused the death of the victim 
Reynaldo Bautista, the killing being attended by the qualifying circumstance of 
<span class="SpellE"><em>alevosia</em></span> or treachery and the <span>generic 
aggravating circumstance of premeditation.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The court is convinced that the accused are guilty of the crime 
charged in the information attended by the qualifying circumstance of treachery 
or <span class="SpellE">alevosia</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The evidence presented by 
the prosecution are not only clear and positive but also logical and in 
accordance with human experience.<span>&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the 
eyewitnesses of the stabbing of the victim by accused <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr. are at 
variance with each other, the Court is more inclined to give credence to the 
version of the prosecution, as earlier pointed out.<span>&nbsp; </span>The witness 
for the accused, from the observation of the Court, is a perjured witness and 
her testimony should be rejected.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is 
unnatural for a person who witnessed a fatal stabbing of a <span class="SpellE">barriomate</span> to keep silent of what she witnessed for more 
than two months.<span>&nbsp; </span>It becomes more incredible with the relation of 
the witness to the accused and her apparent effort to hide such relationship to 
the Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the Court, a witness who is proven not 
to be candid with the Court should not be believed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Such is the 
fate of the testimony of defense witness <span class="SpellE">Amalia</span> <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, who was unmasked by the Prosecution Fiscal, in the 
course of the cross examination, to be a sister-in-law of accused <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span>, she being a 
common-law wife <span>of </span>Pablo <span class="SpellE">Manuyag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Manuyag's</span> brother.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"While it is true that there are inconsistencies in the testimonies 
of the witnesses for the prosecution, the Court notes that such inconsistencies 
refer more to minor details of the incident which do not detract to the main 
incident, which was the killing of the victim Reynaldo Bautista.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considering the educational background of the witnesses <span>and their 
inexperience in giving testimonies before the Court, the Court feels the minor 
inconsistencies add more weight to the testimony of these witnesses.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It only proves that the witnesses were not orchestrated by the 
prosecution.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they related the event that they 
witnessed as perceived by their senses devoid of any coaching or aid from an 
experienced advocate.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The Court also finds that the generic aggravating <span class="GramE">circumstances of premeditation has</span> not been established by 
the evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>No mitigating circumstance was likewise proved or 
established by the defense."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi interposed by the appellants cannot be taken 
seriously.<span>&nbsp; </span>For, well-settled <span>is </span>the rule that alibi 
is a weak defense against positive identification made by the prosecution 
witnesses.<span class="GramE"> (<em>People vs. Cervantes</em>, 125 SCRA 187; 
<em>People vs. Elefano Jr.</em>, 125 SCRA 702).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>We also 
find no reason from the records why the prosecution witnesses should fabricate 
their testimonies and implicate appellants in such a serious crime.</p>
<p class="BODY">Finally, the contention of the appellants that the trial court 
erred in concluding that a conspiracy <span class="GramE">existed,</span> is 
unfounded.<span>&nbsp; </span>The holding of the hands of the victim by the 
appellants insured the commission of the offense.<span>&nbsp; </span>The victim was 
immobilized and prevented from parrying the knife thrust of <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span> <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, Jr.<span>&nbsp; We 
</span>ruled in <em>People vs. Banayo</em>, 129 SCRA 725 that —</p>
<blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE"><span>x</span></span><span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> conspiracy may be inferred though no actual meeting of the 
minds among <span>the </span>accused was proven (<em>People vs. Velez</em>, 58 
SCRA 21).<span>&nbsp; </span>Proof of publicly observable mutual agreement is not 
indispensable to establish conspiracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is conspiracy 
<span>where </span>two of the accused held the victim's hands and the third 
stabbed the victim from behind (<em>People vs. Rhoda, supra</em>).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Each of the offenders performed with such closeness and 
<span>coordination </span>indicating a common purpose or design.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(<em>People vs. Geronimo</em>, 53 SCRA 246)."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, the death indemnity to the heirs of Reynaldo Bautista is reduced 
to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and the moral damages reduced to
