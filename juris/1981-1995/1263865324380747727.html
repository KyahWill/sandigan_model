City Branch 33 presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Sayo</span> docketed as Civil Case No. C-7942 for collection of

the premises of the defendants (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1980</st1:date>,
respondent Court of Appeals issued the questioned decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1980, the Court of Appeals issued a resolution
requiring the respondent sheriff to comment on the petitioners’ Manifestation

by the Court of Appeals on December 16, 1980 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annex “A-1”, p. 29).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1981</st1:date> another resolution

the aforesaid decision is hereby denied for lack of merit and (2) the
respondent Deputy Sheriff Rodrigo C. <span class="SpellE">Saure</span> is hereby

by the trial court in its Order dated June 2, 1981 on the ground that the
motion for reconsideration and/or for new trial is pro-forma and cannot even be
considered as a motion for new trial (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.
58819, Ibid., p. 20).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">rendered </span>by
the lower court on January 30, 1981 was decreed by it as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the

Ibid., p. 21).</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on June 17, 1981, defendants filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
in the Court of Appeals docketed as CA G.R. No. 12561-SP (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annex “C”, pp. 25-49).</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 26, 1981, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATION, We hereby give due course
to this petition, and consequently, the orders and decision, subject of this
petition, are hereby set aside for being null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let the respondent court set the re-trial of

<blockquote>With costs against private respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No. 58819, p. 24)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 4, 1981 respondent Court of Appeals issued the
questioned resolution which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“The writ of execution (Annex “K” to Petition) issued by the
respondent judge has been declared null and void in our decision of August 26,
1981, consequently all seizures and levies made under each authority were also
null and void.</blockquote>

to petitioners all properties seized and levied upon under and in pursuance
with the writ of execution (Annex “R” to petition), specifically those
described and listed in Annex “P” to the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, GR No. 58819, seeking
to annul and set aside the questioned decision and resolution of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in G.R. No. 56073 is whether or not the
respondent Court of Appeals acted with grave abuse of discretion and/or in
excess of and without jurisdiction in annulling the Writ of Preliminary
Attachment issued by the trial court while in G.R. No. 58819, the issue is
whether or not the private respondents could be declared as in default on June
24, 1980 when they failed to appear for trial on the merits on said date
although they have already filed an answer.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in"><u>In</u> <u>G.R.</u>
<u>No.</u> <u>56073</u>:</p>

<p class="BODY">An act of a court or tribunal may only be considered as in grave
abuse of discretion when the same was performed in a capricious or whimsical
exercise of judgment which is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The abuse of discretion must be so patent and
gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to
perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as
where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of
passion or personal hostility (Intestate Estate of Carmen de Luna vs. IAC, 170
SCRA 254 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The writ of attachment under Rule 57, Section 1 of the Rules of
Court can be issued <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ex</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>p</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">arte</span></u></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>if a sufficient cause of action
exists and this is shown by the allegations in the affidavit supporting the
issuance thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of the rules
as specified requires that the affidavit must establish such facts and in the
establishment thereof, general allegations do not qualify for the issuance of
the writ.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Court ruled that the failure to allege <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the </span>affidavit the requisites prescribed for the issuance of the
writ of preliminary attachment, renders the writ of preliminary attachment
issued against the property of the defendant fatally defective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judge issuing it is deemed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>have acted in excess of his
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the defect cannot
even be cured by amendment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the
attachment is a harsh and rigorous remedy which exposes the debtor to
humiliation and annoyance, the rule authorizing its issuance must be strictly
construed in favor of defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
the duty of the court before issuing the writ to ensure that all the requisites
of the law have been complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, a judge acquires no jurisdiction to issue the writ (<span class="SpellE">Jardine</span>-Manila Finance, Inc. vs. CA, 171 SCRA 636 [19891]).</p>

<p class="BODY">An <span class="SpellE">examinination</span> of plaintiffs’
complaint shows that it does not meet the requirements laid down by Sec. 3 Rule
57.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact only paragraph 13 of the
complaint speaks of an alleged fraudulent transfer which is however couched in
generalities, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“13.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The defendants are about to transfer if not at
all doing some ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span> acts by transferring some
assets if not putting in the name/s of their close relatives who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">are </span>not members of the Phil-Car Sales
Corporation, the consignment and/or sale of brand new, re-possessed or old cars
to defraud not only herein plaintiffs but probably all the defendants Phil-Car
Sales Corporation’s creditors.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.
56073, p. 45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A hearing should have been conducted</p>

<p class="BODY">As held by this Court, when a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">judge </span>issues a writ of preliminary attachment <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>,</u> it is incumbent on him, upon proper challenge of
his order to determine whether or not the same was improvidently issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the party against whom the writ is prayed
for squarely controverts the allegation of fraud, it is incumbent on the
applicant to prove his allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
burden of proving that there indeed was fraud lies with the party making such
allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This finds support in
Section 1, Rule 131 Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this jurisdiction, fraud is never presumed (Benitez vs. IAC, 154 SCRA 41
[1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 13 of Rule 57 provides that “(T)he party whose property
has been attached may also, at any time either before or after the release of
the attached property, or before any attachment shall have been actually
levied, upon reasonable notice to the attaching creditor apply to the judge who
granted the order, or to the judge of the court in which the action is pending,
for an order to discharge the attachment on the ground that the same was
improperly or irregularly issued (Mindanao Savings &amp; Loan Association, Inc.
vs. CA, G.R. No. 84481, April 18, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">When an abuse of discretion has been committed by the respondent
Judge, a mandatory preliminary injunction under Rule 58 of the Rules of Court
will lie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Gacutan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sacultido</span>, 164 SCRA 255 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly respondent Court of Appeals cannot be faulted for
issuing the questioned decision and subsequent resolutions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary it is the orders of the lower
court which are null and void because they were issued with grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.3in"><u>In</u> <u>G.R.</u>
<u>No.</u> <u>58819</u>:</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly ruled by the Court of Appeals, there is on<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">l</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">y
o</span>ne instance when a party defendant can properly be declared in default,
and also only one instance under our rules of procedure when a party can be
declared as in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only
instance when a defendant can properly be declared in default is when he fails
to file his answer within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, or
within such extended time as he is allowed by the Court, under Section 1, Rule
18, of the Revised Rules of Court (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R. No.
58819, p. 22).</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, the only instance when a party can be declared “as in
default” is when he fails to appear, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of
notice to him, at a pre-trial conference (Section 2, Rule 20, Revised Rules of
Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ibid.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In no other situation can a party be declared in default or as in
default, as the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere
non-appearance of defendants at an ordinary hearing and to adduce evidence does
not constitute default, when they have already filed their answer to the
complaint within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Violago</span> vs.
Campos, 114 SCRA, 269 [1982]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
error to default a defendant after the answer has already been filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be borne in mind that the policy of
the law is to have every litigated case tried on the merits as much as
possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason that
judgments by default are frowned upon (Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. vs. <span class="SpellE">Romillo</span>, Jr., 141 SCRA 455 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, an answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">was </span>filed by the private respondents; the pre-trial conference
was already terminated, and what was scheduled on June 24, 1980 was a hearing
or trial on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, improper for the lower court to have declared private respondents as
in default and then deprived them of notice of further proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provision of the Rules on Default cannot be interpreted
to mean that the court can just disregard the answer before it, which has long
been filed for that would be nothing less than illogical, unwarranted, and
unjust (Director of Lands vs. Santiago, 160 SCRA 186 [1988]).</p>
