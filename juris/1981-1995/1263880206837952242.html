<blockquote>Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Catalan:</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the outset, you knew I disliked attending court trials, <span style="">that </span>is why to avoid such possibility
with your tenant, I agreed to the stiff price of P1.1 Million for the property
at <st1:street><st1:address>665 <span class="SpellE">Boni</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
<span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> in exchange for your assurance that you
will take care of ejecting your tenant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We signed our agreement to this effect last Dec. 27, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You gave your tenant a 90-day notice to
vacate so that gave him up to the end of March 1986 <span style="">to look </span>for another residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then suddenly, at the end of the 90-day period, you told me that the
tenant had just offered you a better price for the property and you were
considering it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was bad faith, loud
and clear! The tenant had waived any right to the property to all of us
personally during the negotiations; and again, he confirmed this when <span style="">he </span>accepted the 90-day notice to
vacate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without showing my indignation
at this trampling of my rights, I told you I was ready to buy the property even
while the tenant was still residing there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, I was willing now to suffer the inconvenience and added
costs of trying to eject the tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
answered that you had to consult with your principal first and this would take
about two weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 2 weeks extended to
two (2) months and last May 29, 1986 I received your letter rescinding our
contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So any undue delay has been on
your part and deliberately at that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
you kept referr<span style="">i</span>n<span style="">g</span> to as lengthy negotiations were
simply delaying tactics on your part.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As I write this letter, you may have received my lawyer's second
letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now as then, let me say again
that I do not like going to court if I can help it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I feel you have done <span style="">me a </span>grave injustice and a court suit
is the only civilized way to get a redress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My lawyer said the law is on my side and the court can compel you to
sell me the property, aside from making you <span style="">pay </span>for the trial expenses, the damages and attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this latest age, I am still hoping you
would change your mind and decide to proceed with the sale without court
intervention. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Atty. Mar Arias gave you

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of Articles 1370 to 1375 of the Civil Code on the
interpretation of contracts are squarely applicable to this case:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1370.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
terms of a contract are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of the
contracting parties, the literal meaning of its stipulations shall control.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention of the
parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 1371. In order to judge the intention of the contracting
parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally
considered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 1372.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However general
the terms of a contract may be, they shall not <span style="">be </span>understood to comprehend things that are distinct and cases
that are different from those upon which the parties intended to agree.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 1373.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If some
stipulation of <span style="">any </span>contract
should admit of several meanings, it shall <span style="">be </span>understood as bearing that import which is most adequate to
render it effectual.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 1374.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The various
stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the
doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ART. 1375.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Words which may
have different significations shall be understood in that which is most in
keeping with the nature and object of the contract."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the subject contract which the parties labeled as
"Earnest money" shows that it is an agreement to<span style=""> sell the real property described therein for
the amount of P1.1 M with assumption of the P40,000.00 mortgage, by which
5,000.00 was paid upon signing of the agreement by private respondent to
petitioner as earnest money, which is part of the consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The balance of the consideration shall be
paid upon the removal of the tenant or occupant from the premises and upon the
execution of the deed of absolute sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the addendum to the
agreement it is stipulated that in case the buyer fails to purchase the
property after the seller formally notified him of the surrender of </span>the<span style=""> </span><span style="">premises
by the tenant or occupant, in addition to </span>the <span style="">forfeiture of the earnest money, the buyer must pay the seller
P20,000.00 plus attorney's fees and other costs in case of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, if the seller does not
make good his promise to sell the property even after the present tenant shall
have surrendered the premises, the seller binds himself to return the earnest
money and in addition pay the buyer P20,000.00 plus the attorney's fees and
other costs in case of litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This is the literal and
clear agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
their contemporaneous and subsequent acts it also appears that the proceeds of
the sale of the property by petitioners were intended to apply to a proposed
business venture of petitioners abroad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As said proposed business did not prosper and the tenants/occupants of
the premises have not yet vacated the premises, petitioners decided to rescind
the contract of sale in accordance with the </span>agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the addendum to the
same agreement, both parties are given the freedom to back out of the
transaction provided that, in the case of the seller, he must return the
earnest money in addition to being liable to the buyer for </span>P20,000.00
plus attorney's fees and other costs in case of litigation; and in case of the
buyer, the earnest money is forfeited, and he is liable to pay the seller
P20,000.00 in damages plus attorneys fees and other costs in case of litigation
to the seller.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right which is
afforded <span style="">to both parties may be availed
of </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">them, irrespective of whether or not the
occupant of the premises had vacated the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This stipulation is the law between </span>the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the action for specific performance must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">For </span><span style="">the rescission of the contract, petitioners
must return the P5,000.00 earnest money and pay P20,000.00 to the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, they are not liable
for attorneys fees, for it was private respondent who brought the case to court
as a result of which petitioners unnecessarily incurred expenses of litigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals dated </span><st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="12"><span style="">December

upon the petitioners reimbursing to private respondent the P5,000.00 earnest
