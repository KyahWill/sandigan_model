in a petition for relief from judgment filed in the same case but the petition
was denied for having been filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The narration of facts below was taken from the pleadings filed by
the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As regards the proceedings <span class="GramE">following</span> the promulgation of the amended decision, the
dates were supplied in the Comment and Answer filed by respondent judge and
which were not disputed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Blanco was the owner of a
passenger Â­<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which he insured against
liabilities for death and injuries to third persons with First Integrated
Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. (First Insurance) under Motor Vehicle
Policy No. V-05-63751 with the face value of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

<p class="BODY">On November 25, 1976, the said <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
driven by Blanco himself bumped a five-year old child, <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span>
<span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>, causing the latter's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint (pp. 38-41, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)
for damages was brought by the child's parents, the <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>
spouses, against <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Blanco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First Insurance was also <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
in the complaint as the insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 1104 of the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span> (now Regional Trial Court).</p>

on <st1:date year="1978" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, a pre-trial conference was conducted where the <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> spouses presented the following documentary
evidence:</p>

<blockquote>"Exhibit 'A' - Marriage Certificate, Exhibit B - Birth
Certificate, Exhibit B-1 - the Certificate of the Local Civil Registrar,
Exhibit C - Certificate of Death, Exhibit C-1 - the official receipt of the

portion of which states:</p>

 11, 1978</st1:date>, entry of judgment was made, a copy of which was furnished
First Insurance on <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span>
spouses, an order granting execution was issued by the court on <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1978</st1:date>, which was received by

(pp. 31-32, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1978</st1:date>,
First Insurance filed a petition for relief from judgment in the same
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition was set for hearing
on <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No appearance was entered by First Insurance
on the said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1978</st1:date>, the trial court issued
an order, denying the petition for relief from judgment (pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), a copy of which was received by First
Insurance on <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1978</st1:date>
(p. 35, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The records of this case show that on April 11, 1978, the
defendant First Integrated Bonding and Insurance Company, Inc. received a copy
of the amended decision dated March 27, 1978 and found on page 30 of the
records of this case; on May 11, 1978, the Deputy Clerk of Court entered the
corresponding entry of judgment and the First Integrated Bonding and Insurance
Company, Inc. received a copy thereof on June 27, 1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June 13, 1978, the plaintiffs moved for
execution of judgment and the same was granted pursuant to an Order of this Court
dated June 14, 1978 and found on page 35 of the records of this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"And now comes the petition for relief from the Order of
execution and judgment with preliminary injunction filed by First Integrated
Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc. and which was received by this Court on
September 5, 1978; on September 28, 1978, the plaintiffs filed their written
opposition to the petition for relief from judgment and preliminary
injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The opposition is based on
three grounds, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that</span> the petition
is filed out of time; 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that there was
gross and notorious negligence of the Insurance Company; 3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that this case is within the jurisdiction of
this Court and therefore the cause of action of the plaintiffs deserves
judicial consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It was on April 11, 1978 that the First Integrated Bonding
and Insurance Co., Inc. received the amended decision and the petition for
relief from Order of Execution and judgment with preliminary injunction was
filed on September 5, 1978 or a period of 191 days already expired, that is,
more than 6 months already as required by Section 3, Rule 38 of the Rules Of
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the first ground
invoked by the opposition must be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the second ground, the records of this case show that the First
Integrated Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc. was duly summoned and served a copy
of the complaint on August 16, 1977 and it was received by the President of the
Insurance Company as shown by the certificate of Service of the Sheriff of
Manila and found in page 12 and page 13 of the records of this case; after the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period to file an answer expired, the
plaintiffs move to declare the defendant insurance company in default and
likewise asked the Court that they be allowed to present their evidence on
January 23, 1978 and which was granted by this Court pursuant to an order dated
January 19, 1978 and found on page 16 of the records of this case; after the
reception of the evidence for the plaintiffs this Court rendered a decision on
March 1, 1978 and which is found on pages 23 to 26 of the records of this case;
subsequently, on March 27, 1978, an amended decision was issued by this Court
and it is found on page 30 of the records of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, therefore, the First Integrated
Bonding and Insurance Co., Inc. <span class="GramE">was</span> grossly and
notoriously negligent in giving the proper attention to this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This kind of gross and notorious negligence
can not be considered excusable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
last ground is that this Court has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs' cause of
action against the insurance company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This ground is well-taken because according to Section 416 of the
Philippine Insurance Code, Presidential Decree No. 612, it provides that the
authority to adjudicate granted to the Commissioner of insurance shall be
concurrent with that of the civil courts, but the filing of a complaint with
the commissioner shall preclude the civil courts from taking cognizance of a
suit involving the same subject matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the plaintiffs did not intervene in the criminal aspect of
this case, instead, they filed a separate and independent civil action on <st1:date year="1977" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1977</st1:date> and which is now the
present Civil Case No. 1104.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be
added, that the matter of exhaustion of administrative remedy maybe waived
which has been so in the present case because the First Integrated Bonding and
Insurance Co., Inc, was declared in default.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing
considerations, the petition for relief from the order of execution and
judgment with preliminary injunction, for lack of merit, is hereby denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span>
(pp. 33-34, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">First Insurance filed a motion for reconsideration of the order
denying the petition for relief on <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="5">May
 14, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was set
for hearing and again no appearance was entered by the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
First Insurance (p. 35, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), prompting the
trial court to deny the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1979</st1:date>,
the herein petitioner First Insurance filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in deciding for the
respondent spouse(s) where there exists no cause of action against the herein
petitioner.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred when it abbreviated
the proceeding and rendered judgment based only on the documentary evidence <span class="GramE">presented<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>during</span> the
pre-trial conference.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in holding the petitioner
liable in excess of the limits of liability as provided for in the policy
contract.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1979</st1:date>,
this Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the respondents from
enforcing the Writ of Execution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="8">August
 1, 1978</st1:date> (p. 19, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioner that the <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> spouses have no cause of action against it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As parents of the victim, they may proceed
against the driver, <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> Blanco on the basis of
the provisions of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, they have no cause of action against First Insurance, because
they are not parties to the insurance contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that where the insurance contract provides for
indemnity against liability to a third party, such third party can directly sue
the insurer (<span class="SpellE">Caguia</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Fieldman's</span>
Insurance Co., Inc. G.R. No. 23276, November 29, 1968, 26 SCRA 178).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The liability of the insurer to such third
person is based on contract while the liability of the insured to the third
party is based on tort (Malayan Insurance Co., Inc. v. CA, L-36413, September
26, 1988, 165 SCRA 536).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This rule was
explained in the case of Shafer v. Judge, RTC of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>
City, Br. 75, G.R. No. 78848, <st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="11"><span class="GramE">November</span> 14, 1988</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"The injured for whom the contract of insurance is intended
can sue directly the insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
general purpose of statutes enabling an injured person to proceed directly
against the insurer is to protect injured persons against the insolvency of the
insured who causes such injury, and to give such injured person a certain beneficial
interest in the proceeds of the policy, and statutes are to be liberally
construed so that their intended purpose may be accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>It</u> <u>has</u> <u>even</u> <u>been</u> <u>held</u>

<blockquote>"In the event that the injured fails or refuses to include the
insurer as party defendant in his claim for indemnity against the insured, the
latter is not prevented by law to avail of the procedural rules intended to
avoid multiplicity of suits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Not</u> <u>even</u>

SCRA) (underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">First Insurance cannot evade its liability as insurer by hiding
under the cloak of the insured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
liability is primary and not dependent on the recovery of judgment from the
insured.</p>

<blockquote>"Compulsory Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance (third party <span class="GramE">liability,</span> or TPL) is primarily intended to provide
compensation for the death or bodily injuries suffered by innocent third
parties or passengers as a result of a negligent operation and use of motor
vehicles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victims and/or their

Judge, RTC of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, <u>supra</u>, p. 390)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Blanco denied that he was negligent when the
incident occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, during the
pre-trial conference, when respondent judge admitted all the exhibits of the
plaintiffs to abbreviate the proceedings, no objection was interposed by
Blanco.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When a decision was rendered
based only on the exhibits of the plaintiffs, Blanco likewise did not object.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No motion for reconsideration was filed by
either Blanco or First Insurance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
the decision became final and may no longer be attacked.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted also that First Insurance was declared in
default because of its failure to file an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as it was concerned, it failed to
raise any <span class="SpellE">triable</span> issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It lost its standing in court and judgment
may be rendered against it on the basis only of the evidence of the <span class="SpellE">Advincula</span> spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner had been given its day in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite its having been declared in default
and its failure to file a motion to lift the order of default, it was still
notified of the subsequent proceedings in the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But no positive step was taken by it on time
to vacate the order of default, the decision nor the amended decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it chose to file a petition for
relief from judgment on <st1:date year="1978" day="1" month="9">September 1,
 1978</st1:date> almost five (5) months from its receipt of a copy of the
amended decision on <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the said petition for relief from
judgment was filed out of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
rules require that such petitions must be filed within sixty (60) days after
the petitioner learns of the judgment and not more than six (6) months after
such judgment was entered (Rule 38, Section 3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The period fixed by Rule 38 of the Rules of Court is non-extendible and
never interrupted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not subject to
any condition or contingency, because it is itself devised to meet a condition
or contingency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remedy allowed by
Rule 38 is an act of grace, as it were, designed to give the aggrieved party
another and last chance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being in the
position of one who begs, such party's privilege is not to impose conditions,
haggle or dilly-dally, but to grab what is offered him (<span class="SpellE">Palomares</span>,
