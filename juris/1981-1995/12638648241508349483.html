recently decided by this Court and involving the same parties, we reproduce the
following summary of the facts therein which are equally relevant in the
present case:</p>

<blockquote>"On November 29, 1984, in NLRC-NCR Case No. 2517-84 entitled
'Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions (PAFLU-RMC Chapter) and its
Members v. Riverside Mills Corporation, et al.', Labor Arbiter Manuel Caday
awarded separation pay, wage and/or living allowance increases and 13th month
pay to the individual complainants who comprise some of the respondents in this
case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 18, 1985, Labor Arbiter Teodorico Dogelio likewise
awarded separation pay, vacation and sick leave pay and unpaid increases in the
basic wage and allowances to the other private respondents herein in NLRC Case
No. NCR-7-2577-84 entitled ‘Michael Peñalosa, Jose Garcia and Apolinar Ray, et
al. v. Riverside Mills <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Corporation, et
al., and Samahang Diwang Manggagawa sa RMC-FFW Chapter, et al. v. Riverside
Mills Corporation (RMC).’ On March 29, 1985, after the judgment had become
final and executory, Dogelio issued a writ of execution directing NLRC Deputy
Sheriff Juanito Atienza to collect the total sum of Eighty Five Million Nine
Hundred Sixty One Thousand Fifty-Eight &amp; 70/100 Pesos
(P85,961,058.70).  The Deputy Sheriff,
however, failed to collect the amount so he levied upon personal and real
properties of RMC.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 25, 1985, a notice of levy on execution of certain
real properties was annotated on the certificate of title filed with the
Register of Deeds of Pasig, Metro Manila, where all the said properties are
situated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile in the other development which led to this case,
petitioner DBP obtained a writ of possession on June 7, 1985 from the Regional
Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig of all the properties of RMC after having
extra-judicially foreclosed the same at public auction <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">earlier in </span>1983</u>.  DBP <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">subsequently
leased the said properties to Egret Trading and Manufacturing Corporation,
Rosario Textile Mills and General Textile Mills.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>writ of possession
prevented<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the scheduled auction sale of
the RMC properties which were levied upon by the private respondents.  As a result, on June 19, 1985, the latter
filed an incidental petition with the NLRC to declare their preference over the
levied properties.  The petition
entitled ‘PAFLU-RMC Chapter and its members, Michael Peñalosa, et al., and the
Samahang <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Diwang Manggagawa sa RMC-FFW
Chapter and its members v. RMC and DBP, et al.’, was docketed as NLRC Case No.
NCR-7-2577-84.  Petitioner DBP filed its
position paper and memorandum in answer to the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>  "On October 31, 1985,
Dogelio issued an order recognizing and declaring the respondents’ first
preference as regards wages and other benefits due them over and above all
earlier encumbrances on the aforesaid properties/assets of said company, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">particularly those being asserted by
respondent Development Bank of the Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petitioner appealed the order of Dogelio to the
NLRC.  The latter in turn, set aside the
order and remanded the case to public respondent Labor Arbiter Santos for
further proceedings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, another set of complainants (who are also named as
respondents herein) filed, on April 7, 1986, a complaint for separation pay,
underpayment, damages, etc., entitled ‘Jaime Arada, et al. v. RMC, DBP,
Egret-Trading and Manufacturing Corp., docketed as NLRC Case NO.
NCR-4-1278-86.’ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">This case was
subsequently consolidated with the case pending before respondent Santos.  Accordingly, the latter conducted several
hearings </span>where <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the parties,
particularly DBP.  General Textile
Mills, Inc., and Rosario Textile Mills, Inc., were given the opportunity to
argue their respective theories of the case.  Eventually, all the parties agreed that the case shall be submitted for
decision after their filing of position papers and/or memorandums.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On March 31, 1987, public respondent Santos rendered the
questioned decision, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dispositive </span>portion
of which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">  </span>'WHEREFORE, it is hereby declared that all the complainants

<p class="BODY">During the pendency of the abovementioned cases, on June 26, 1985
herein private respondent Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) filed with
the Regional Trial Court, Branch CXLIV, Makati, Metro Manila, a complaint for
injunction and damages, with preliminary injunction, docketed as Civil Case No.
10945.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Peñalosa, Samahang Diwang Manggagawa sa RMC-FFW Chapter, et al. Deputy Sheriff
Juanito Atienza and Deputy Sheriff Romeo de la Cruz.  The complaint sought to enjoin the therein defendants, their
agents or deputies from implementing the writ of execution issued in NLRC Case
No. NCR-7-2577-84 and for the return of the properties that Sheriff Atienza had
allegedly caused to be taken out from the RMC compound.  Private respondent bank also prayed to be
declared the rightful owner of the properties involved in the case.  On the same date, a temporary restraining
order was issued in connection with said case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 5, 1985, an urgent motion to dismiss the complaint and to
lift and dissolve the temporary restraining order <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>filed by petitioners.  Said motion was denied by the trial court in its order of June 30, 1986
which, at the same time approved private respondent's application for writs of
preliminary prohibitory and mandatory injunction upon posting of a bond in the
amount of P50,000.00.  Petitioners were
required to file an answer within fifteen days from receipt of the order.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the part of the petitioners, on April 9, 1986 they filed Civil
Case No. 53333 in Branch 158 of the Regional Trial Court at Pasig, Metro
Manila, for the nullification of the lease agreement between private respondent
and Egret Trading, Inc. which were made defendants therein,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

case appears in the records to still be pending.</p>

<p class="BODY">  In the present petition
filed on July 31, 1986, a jurisdictional question is raised by the
petitioners.  It is averred that
"(i)n denying petitioner's Motion to dismiss Complaint, lift and dissolve
the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ex parte</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>restraining Order, and in assuming
jurisdiction over the same Complaint, by granting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>writs sought by respondent bank and by requiring the
petitioners herein to file their Answer to  the Complaint, the Honorable Candido P. Villanueva has  acted without jurisdiction, in excess of
jurisdiction and with grave abuse of discretion."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> This
contention is premised on the claim that the properties involved in the
aforesaid case before the trial court are the same properties litigated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the National Labor Relations
Commission as NLRC-NCR Case No. 7-2577-84 wherein the resolution of the
principal issue of preferential right and/or lawful ownership over said
properties was sought.  Petitioners
contend that the "NLRC having taken jurisdiction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">over </span>the subject matter of the case, involving as they do
similar or identical causes of action with the civil complaint with the RTC,
should continue to exercise jurisdiction until the whole dispute is
resolved" since to allow both actions to proceed would result in the
splitting of a cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Several months after the filing of the present petition, another
petition for <i>certiorari</i> was filed on May 8, 1987 by private respondent
DBP, this time questioning the March 31, 1987 decision of Labor Arbiter Ariel
Santos, the decretal portion and factual background of which have been earlier
set forth.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 8, 1989, this Court promulgated its decision, quoted in
part at the outset, in said DBP case holding that said labor arbiter
"committed grave abuse of discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in
</span>ruling that the private respondents may enforce their first preference
in the satisfaction of their claim over those of the petitioner (DBP) in the
absence of a declaration of bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of RMC."
Consequently, the aforesaid decision of the labor arbiter of March 31, 1987 was
annulled and set aside.  Nevertheless,
it was ruled that there is nothing to prevent the respondents in that case who
are petitioners herein, from instituting involuntary insolvency or other
appropriate proceedings against their employer RMC where their claims can be
asserted with respect to their employer's assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing final decision in G.R. No. 78261-62, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>no further legal basis or necessity
to decide the issue of preferential right claimed by petitioners over the
property of Riverside Mills Corporation in NLRC-NCR Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No. </span>7-2577-84.  Furthermore, that very property subject of
their aborted claim of first preference is alleged by DBP as no longer owned by
said judgment debtor corporation at the time the writ of execution issued by
the commission was sought to be enforced, hence said private respondent filed
Civil Case No. 10945 seeking, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u>alia</u>, a declaration of its
ownership thereover.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the Court in G.R. Nos. 78261-62 and hereinbefore
quoted, "DBP obtained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>writ
of possession on June 7, 1985 from the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pasig of
all the properties of RMC after having extra-judicially foreclosed the same at
public auction <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">earlier in 1983</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">." </span>The records of said cases
contain a copy of Transfer Certificate of Title No. (50170) 21602 of the
Registry of Deeds for Metro Manila (Province of Rizal), consisting of 10,776
square meters, located at Barrio Rosario, Pasig, Rizal, in the name of
Riverside Mills Corporation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> The

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If the disputed property
did not belong to the judgment debtor in NLRC Case No. 7-2577-84, it could not
be validly levied upon by the sheriff for the satisfaction of the judgment

aforesaid </span>Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Case No. 10945
and to issue the questioned writs of preliminary injunction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The rule is settled that
even if a writ of execution is issued by a co-equal court, and we place the
National Labor Relations Commission in the same category for purposes of this

later, the writs of preliminary injunction on the basis of DBP's claim of
ownership over the properties levied upon.  We have heretofore ruled that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under Sec. 17 of Rule 39 a third person who claims property
levied upon on execution may vindicate such claim by action.  Obviously, a judgment rendered in his favor,
declaring him to be the owner of the property, would not constitute
interference with the powers or processes of the court which rendered the
judgment to enforce which the execution was levied.  If that be so - and it is so because the property being that of a
stranger is not subject to levy - then an interlocutory order, such as
injunction, upon a claim and prima facie showing of ownership by the claimant,
cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be considered as such
interference either."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that, as a rule, no temporary or permanent injunction

is likewise conceded that the judgment account of Riverside Mills Corporation
arose out of its labor dispute with the herein petitioners who were the
complainants in NLRC Case No. NCR-7-2577-84.  The foregoing notwithstanding, where the writ of execution issued by
said commission is sought to be enforced upon property of a stranger to the
labor dispute, even upon a mere <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing of ownership
of such claimant, a separate action for injunctive relief against such levy may
be maintained in court since said action neither involves nor grows out of a
labor dispute insofar as the third party is concerned.</p>

New Labor Code x x x which prohibits injunctions or restraining orders in any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">case involving or growing out of a 'labor
dispute' is not well-taken.  This has no
application to the case at bar.  Civil
Case No. 2749 is one which neither 'involves' nor ‘grows out’ of a labor
dispute.  What ‘involves’ or 'grows out'
of a labor dispute is the NLRC case between petitioners and the judgment
debtor, Philippine Iron Mines.  The
private respondents are not parties to the said NLRC case.  Civil Case No. 2749 does not put in issue
either the fact or validity of the proceeding in the NLRC case nor the decision
therein rendered, much less the writ of execution rendered thereunder.  It does not seek to enjoin the execution of
the decision against the properties of the judgment debtor.  What is sought to be tried in Civil Case No.
2749, is whether the NLRC's decision and writ of execution, above mentioned,
shall be permitted to be satisfied against properties of private respondents,
and not of the judgment debtor named in the NLRC decision and writ of
execution.  Such a recourse is allowed
