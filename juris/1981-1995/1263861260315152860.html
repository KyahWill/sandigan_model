testament aforesaid, the spouses were beset with marital problems.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in November, 1977, <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>

June 18, 1978, before the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, docketed as Special Proceedings No. 25601.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Five days later, or on <st1:date year="1978" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1978</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>

property, without his wife's consent, in favor of <span class="SpellE">Laureana</span>

<p class="BODY">With <span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span> death, Special

the respondent opposed the allowance of the will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For lack of jurisdiction, no ruling was
however made on her claim, but the probate court decreed the allowance of the
last will and testament and ordered the issuance of Letters of Administration
(should correctly be letters testamentary) in favor of petitioner in a decision

<p class="BODY">Consequently, an action to compel the petitioner to give her
conformity to the deed of sale executed by her husband in favor of the
respondent was instituted by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">latter
in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch
XCVIII, docketed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Q-34527, which court,
making the following disquisition:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>On the confronting issue of whether or not the defendant can be
compelled to signify her conformity in the deed of sale, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">it is </span>the considered opinion of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the court that weighing their respective
evidence and the end line of arguments of the parties in view of the peculiar
circumstances attendant to the case that the refusal of the defendant to give
consent to the sale of what rightly belongs to her husband was
unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the court
believes and so holds that defendant can be compelled to grant the same consistent
with the last provision of Article 166 of the New Civil Code whichever one-half
(1/2) portion of the whole estate she may </span>choose from the survey plan of
the project of partition (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 28, Q-25601) shall be
segregated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As can be gathered from the records, the present case presupposes <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>situation where the husband
disposed of his legitimate share one-half (1/2) of the conjugal property so
that his pressing financial needs for medical and hospitalization expenses
could be met.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant appears to
have been accorded all the formalities required of the marital companionship in
securing her consent but none of the representaÂ­tions were heeded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that letters (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
E, Q-34527; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 28, Q-25601) for a proposed
partition and seeking of conformity for her to stamp approval of the deed of
sale were never denied since this was confirmed by the records of the
proceedings (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>. <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1978</st1:date>, pp. 19-20, Q-25601).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is argued that this has been done
upon the prodding of other interested parties, nowhere has it been shown that
the defendant ever reacted when she acknowledged the subject letters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contents of said letters were signifiÂ­cant
since the proposed partition and/or conveyance of the husband's one-half share
means life and death to the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
the husband's mind, this so far is the only remaining alternative to keep him
alive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a wife </span>who is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">so near
yet so far and while there are relatives who are willing to help, they
themselves are similarly poor and impoverished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of "<span class="SpellE">Baello</span> vs.
Villanueva," 54 Phil. 213, the Court held that "For as conjugal
properties belong equally to husband and wife, any alienation </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the husband without the consent of his wife
prejudices her in so far as it includes a part or whole of the wife's half and
is to that extent invalid." This decision of the court fortifies the
relative </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">significance </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of Article 900 of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Civil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Code providing that if the only survivor is the widow or widower, she
or he shall be entitled to one-half of the hereditary estate of the deceased
spouse, and the testator may freely dispose of the other half.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid decision sustains the belief of
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that the disposition or alienation of the
conjugal property is not valid only to the extent of prejudicing the wife's
one-half share of the realty and with respect to his own one-half share, the
disposition has been done in its right perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present situation, consent to alienate
his one-half (1/2) share of the conjugal property has been sought and this was
manifested in plaintiff's letters (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E, Q-34527
and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 28, Q-25601) and defendant's refusal was
never justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the mind of the
court, the defendant's failure to give the rationale of her refusal to act on a
situation that demands the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">propriety
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of a reply is unreasonable in the
concept of Article 166 and therefore, the court may compel her to grant the
same.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

that no sale of conjugal properties by the husband may be validly made without
the consent of the wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant cited

consent, the court may compel her to grant the </span>same.</p>

<p class="2Q">"This article shall not apply to property acquired by the
conjugal partnership before the effective date of this Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(1413a).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Art. 167.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of
abuse of powers of administration of the conjugal partnership property by the
husband, the courts, on petition of the wife, may provide for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>receivership, or administration by

</span>(n)."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The general rule is, the husband may not validly sell real estates
belonging to the conjugal partnership without the wife's consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this rule accepts exceptions,
wherein the husband may sell the real properties owned by the conjugal
partnership even without the consent of the wife:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) sale of personal properties; 2) real
properties acquired before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New
Civil Code; 3) real properties acquired after <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>

the purpose is to secure the future of their children or finishing a career
(Art. 162); and 6) moderate gift for charity (Art. 174).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The sale by <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> of one-half (1/2) of
each of the conjugal properties to <span class="SpellE">Domondon</span> was
allegedly for the purpose of paying the husband's hospital expenses in order
that he would get well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a decided
case, it was held that while the marriage and the legal conjugal partnership
subsists, the support of the wife, conversely, of the husband, is a charge upon
the partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><b>Sumulong</b></span><b>
v. <span class="SpellE">Cembrano</span></b>, 51 Phil. 719).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The partnership is not relieved of this
obligation by the mere fact that the spouses do not live under the same roof
(Ibid.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amounts advanced by third
persons for the subsistence of the wife (or husband) are chargeable against the
property of the conjugal partnership (<span class="SpellE"><b>Sochayseng</b></span><b>
v. <span class="SpellE">Trijillo</span></b>, 31 Phil. 153; <span class="SpellE"><u>Galang</u></span>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Estela</span> <span class="SpellE">Costuna</span>
never rebutted the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> assertion that the
proceeds of the sale were utilized for the hospitalization and medication of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether her
refusal to support her ailing and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">aging
</span>husband was because of her outright refusal to do so or her financial
incapability to give, does not matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was sufficient that <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> had no other
recourse but to sell his share in the conjugal property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 171 of the New Civil Code provides that "the husband
may dispose of the conjugal partnership property for purposes specified in
Articles 161 and 162".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means
that the husband may alienate the conjugal properties even without the consent
of the wife if the proceeds thereof will be utilized for those provided under
Articles 161 and 162.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the applicable provision is paragraph (1) of
Article 161 which provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"(1) All debts and obligations contracted by the husband for
the benefit of the conjugal partnership, and those contracted by the wife, also
for the same purpose, in the cases where she may legally bind the
partnership;"</p>

<blockquote>The support of either
spouses (sic) is definitely for the benefit of the conjugal partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For if either of them is physically ill, the
conjugal partnership likewise suffers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering the above reasons, We are predisposed to decree that the
sale of one-half of the conjugal properties made by the husband for his
hospitaliza<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tion and medical purposes </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">valid.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lastly, <span class="SpellE">Estela</span> <span class="SpellE">Costuna</span>
alleged that the sale was void because it was merely simulated and in fact the
consideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">thereof was not given.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After a careful and thorough peruÂ­sal of the transcript of
stenographic notes and the evidence presented therein, We find that the
consideration was paid and indeed utilized for the hospitalization and
medication of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Costuna</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's allegation is conjectural.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She failed to prove her assertions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The documentary evidence on record showed
that the consideration was received and utilized for the purpose alleged in the
deed of sale.</blockquote>

of sale, <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> was 81 years old and gravely ill; b)
while the deed of sale was signed by <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>, his
signature was illegible; c) the probability that he was unconscious at the time
that he signed the document and that somebody may have guided his hand is not
remote; d) the absence of the signature of both parties in the acknowledgement

duties to her husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asserts that
her husbandâs relatives held him (husband) in "captivity" making it
impossible for her to give him the care, attention, and love that he most
needed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, she avers that all
efforts were exerted by her, to regain custody of her husband but </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

unfortunately rendered moot and academic by the death of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>
on November 5, 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She claims to have
shouldered the funeral bills and other miscellaneous expenses of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> as the relatives suddenly abandoned him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she theorizes that Art. 161 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

here <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> abandoned her and the conjugal home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The private respondent on
the other hand naturally supports the common ruling of the trial court and the
Court of Appeals that the deed of sale </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">valid,
notwithstanding the absence of consent, because the disposition of the one-half
(1/2) undivided portion of the conjugal </span>partnership properties was
intended to generate funds to cover <span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span> hospital
and medical expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She argues that
the disposition of one half (1/2) of the conjugal estate should be effected by
either one of the spouses without the consent and conformity of the other for
as long as what belongs to the other by such act would not suffer or be
prejudiced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She submits that if consent
is wanting, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>not <span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span> fault <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">can </span>not be denied that the
petitioner's consent, first to the intended partition and later to the sale,
was repeatedly sought by <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>required
by law and out of marital courtesy, but the petitioner tenaciously withheld her
consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asserts that the
petitioner's refusal was not only unreasonable, unjustified, but above all,
cruel, for <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> was asking for his legitimate share
not to squander but to enable him to settle his hospital bills and defray the
cost of his medication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondent theorizes that the petitioner in turning her back and denying her
husband the moral and financial assistance at the time when most needed and her
refusal to stamp her approval on the deed of sale are devoid of cogent reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asserts that no other motive could be
attributed to the petitioner but her selfishness and cupidity thinking that
perhaps she could own all the conjugal partnership properties upon her
husband's death, they having no children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She contends that the Court of Appeals did not err when it applied the
provisions of Art. 161 of the Civil Code because the payment of the hospital
and medical expenses no doubt redounded to the benefit of the conjugal
partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She maintains that there is
here no case of abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That while
it is true that <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> left the conjugal home, the
reason for his leaving was his desire for survival.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no denying that <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> sought the petitioner's consent to the deed of sale
which consent was adamantly withheld by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As may be gleaned from the </span>records,
her refusal stemmed from her belief that the deed of sale was executed in fraud
of her, yet she did not do anything to impugn the said deed notwithstanding
that the right is vested on her by law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
She assailed for the first time the validity of the sale only when Civil Case
No. Q-34527 was instituted by the res<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">p</span>ondent
in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, to compel
her to give her consent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Notably, what was sold by
<span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> without the </span>petitioner's consent was
only an undetermined one-half (1/2) share in the community properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He left intact that other undetermined 1/2
share which should belong to the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the reason for the sale was, as correctly found by the trial court
and Court of Appeals, for <span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span> hospitalization
and medication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>therefore
<span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span> understandable human spirit to live<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">longer
that induced him to execute the deed of sale without the consent of the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We concede that the consent of the petitioner is essential for
the validity of the sale, but, in this case, where consent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>unreasonably
withheld, we are constrained to relax the application of the law and consider
the sale as falling within the recognized exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court can not overlook the vital fact
that <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> executed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a last </span>will and testament designating
the petitioner as his sole heir.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this
connection, we find merit in the respondent's assertion that no other motive
could be attributed to the petitioner but her greed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether or not <span class="SpellE">Amadeo's</span>
hospital and medical expenses are chargeable to the conjugal partnership is
answered in the affirmative and finds firm support in Art. 161 of the Civil
Code, which provides <b>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></b>:</p>

<blockquote>The conjugal partnership shall be liable for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) all debts and obligations contracted by
the husband for the benefit of the conjugal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">partnership, and those contracted by the wife, also for the same
purpose, in the cases where she may legally bind the partnership.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The benefit required by this article need not be quantified into
pesos or square meters of real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is enough that the transaction would result to some <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">discernible advantage or good to the conjugal
partnership, directly or indirectly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the health and well-being of both or either of the spouses would
undeniably redound to the benefit of their conjugal partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The advancement of the interests of the
conjugal partnership depends in great measure on the soundness of the body and
mind of the partners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the foregoing, we hold that the conjugal
partnership property is liable for the hospital and medical expenses of <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is in this case no convincing reason to disturb the
findings of fact of the Court of Appeals which are generally binding on this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the petition is hereby DENIED, and the
