<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Llarena</span> having manifested his intention
to appeal when judgment was promulgated on <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1984</st1:date>, the Trial Court ordered the appeal
elevated to this Court on account of the capital penalty imposed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As is usual in cases of this kind, conviction or acquittal hinged
on the relative credibility of the appellant, on the one hand, and of the
complainant, on the other, as assessed by the Trial Court which in this
instance lodged its credence in the version offered by the prosecution and
resting chiefly on said complainant's testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, the prosecution's version is as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="4">April
 24, 1978</st1:date> <span class="SpellE">Emelyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Jasarena</span>
was picked up by Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Llarena</span> from her place of
work in the fa<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">c</span>tory of
Continental Chua <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, San Pedro, Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Llarena</span>, who drove
for <span class="SpellE">Emelyn's</span> uncle, Atty. Jose Alvarez, was at the
wheel of her uncle's car; and he told her that Atty. Alvarez had sent for her
to talk to her about certain important matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Llarena</span>
drove with <span class="SpellE">Emelyn</span> to the Quad complex in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>, where they had some
refreshments following which he prevailed upon her to watch with him a movie
then showing at one of the Quad cinema houses, telling her that it was still
too early to reach her uncle at his office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the movie, <span class="SpellE">Llarena</span> brought <span class="SpellE">Emelyn</span> to the Monaco Hotel in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and took her to an upstairs room where, overpowering all her attempts to resist
his advances and threatening her with dire consequences if she did not submit
to him, he repeatedly raped her over the next couple of nights and days.</p>

<p class="BODY">After two days, <span class="SpellE">Emelyn's</span> uncle, Atty.
Alvarez, showed up at their hotel room and to him she confided what <span class="SpellE">Llarena</span> had done to her, telling Alvarez that she had been
forced against her will to submit to <span class="SpellE">Llarena</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the hotel, Atty. Alvarez brought her,
first, to the municipal hall of San Pedro, La<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">g</span>una and then to the residence of the town's vice mayor where
they were joined by <span class="SpellE">Emelyn's</span> mother, to whom <span class="SpellE">Emelyn</span> repeated what she had earlier told Atty.
Alvarez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later that same day, because
the San Pedro police authorities claimed that they could not take cognizance of
a possible charge for rape committed in another jurisdiction, she was taken to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where she gave <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>written
statement to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Llorando</span> of the Southern
Police District.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was then brou<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">g</span>ht to the residence of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City Fiscal Ernesto A. <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
to swear to the truth of her statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the following day, she underwent a general physical and genital
examination at the National Bureau of Investigation which reported findings
"compatible with sexual intercourse with man on or about the (sic) alleged
dates of commission."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning what transpired after the appellant and <span class="SpellE">Emelyn</span> were found by her uncle at the Monaco Hotel, <span class="SpellE">Emelyn's</span> testimony is corroborated by other witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is, however, the sole witness to what had
occurred earlier, except to the extent confirmed by the appellant as
hereinafter stated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's version tallies with that of the prosecution in
almost every particular aspect except for those supporting or detailing the
crucial claims of, first, deceit and later, intimidation and force, having been
practiced on the complainant in order to carry out and consummate his lewd
designs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In essence, his<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>defense is that everything that had
transpired had been with the consent and willing cooperation of the
complainant, who had freely yielded herself to him because they were
sweethearts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
He suggests that the charge of rape was filed because the complainant found out
that he was already married and could not therefore wed her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The brief for the appellant<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> assigns four (4) errors to the
appealed decision, all of which take issue with the credibility of one or
another aspect of the story told by the complainant on the stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "Manifestation and Motion"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
submitted in lieu of a brief for the People by the Solicitor General makes
virtually the same negative evaluation and seconds the appellant's plea for a
reversal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And a review of the record
persuasively shows that, indeed, the prosecution's evidence strikes, as it
were, too many false notes to have the ring of truth rendering it plainly
insufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For a girl already 20
at the time and a high school graduate by her own account, the complainant demonstrated
an incredible <span class="SpellE">naivete</span> in taking the appellant's word
that her uncle wanted to talk to her and going with<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>him to <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> for
that purpose, given the fact that she and her uncle lived in the same place
(San Vicente, Laguna) and she could more easily and conveniently have reached
him by simply going home, and that she also professed not knowing whether her
uncle had<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>maintained an office in Makati;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Incredibly, too, her
suspicions about appellant's sincerity and real intentions were not aroused when,
they having arrived in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, he put off taking her
to her uncle on the pretext that it was still too early, and she accepted his
invitation to refreshments and later a movie which they watched for one full showing;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the movie,
instead of insisting that she be taken to her uncle or returned to her home,
she docilely permitted the appellant to drive her to a hotel in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>, and his true intentions finally dawned upon her only
when he dragged her from the car and to an upstairs room where he was to keep
her captive and ravish her at will for the next two days;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During all the time
that she and the appellant were sequestered in the hotel, beyond offering
futile resistance to the latter's sexual assaults, she made no outcry, no
attempt to flee or attract attention to her plight; she claims she could not
escape because the appellant stripped her naked and kept her clothing, but this
could hardly have deterred one bent on fleeing his clutches since she also
stated that she had a blanket to cover herself;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">5. The complainant's testimony suggests that no one disturbed
their seclusion during those two days and nights, hence there was no one whose
attention she could attract or whose help she could enlist; this is, however,
also difficult to believe because she also claimed that while she refused food
and took only water throughout her stay in the hotel, the appellant did in fact
regularly order and partake of food; it, therefore, being presumable that the
two were not left entirely alone but that someone must have been admitted into
the room from time to time, if only to bring in and serve the food and drink
ordered by the appellant;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a><span style="font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">6. The complainant had no reason whatsoever to trust the
appellant as it appeared she did, if it is true as she testified that she
barely knew him and had met him for the first time only on April 14, 1978, only
twelve (12) days before the incident;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">7. It is also significant that for all that the evidence shows,
Atty. Alvarez took quite matter-of-factly his finding of the complainant and
the appellant in a hotel room in a situation indicating that dalliance had
occurred between the two; by the complainant's own account, he acted as if it
was the most ordinary thing in the world for them to be at such a place and in
such circumstances; he evinced no hostility to the appellant, did not threaten
him in any way, and uttered nothing beyond a mild reproof ("<span class="SpellE">hindi</span> ka <span class="SpellE">naman</span> gusto <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">bata</span>"), though she told
him (Alvarez) that she had been brought there and had submitted to the appellant
against her will;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> indeed, the appellant testified
without contradiction that it was he who had called Atty. Alvarez to inform the
latter that he and the complainant were at the Monaco Hotel -- an indication
that he believed himself innocent of any crime;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> moreover, Atty. Alvarez was never
called to testify for the prosecution, an omission suggesting that what he had
to say would not support the story of the complainant, his own niece.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court has time and again ruled, while in view of the
character of the offense of rape and the circumstances usually attending its
commission, it is entirely proper -- also often unavoidable -- to convict on
the sole testimony of the offended party, such testimony must, however, be on
the whole consistent and convincing enough to preclude all reasonable doubts,
because an accusation of rape is easy to make and difficult to disprove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is all-too-evident that that criterion is
not satisfied here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grave
deficiencies just noted in the proofs of the prosecution, give an aura of total
unreality to an already hardly credible story of being held captive for two
days and repeatedly violated by an unarmed man -- there being no suggestion
whatsoever that the appellant carried or used any weapon -- ­without there
having been any opportunity at all to flee or seek <span class="SpellE">succour</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon what the record shows about the state of
the proof, the Court sees no just alternative to an acquittal, even without
giving ear to the appellant's disclaimers and his defense that the accusation had
been trumped up by the complainant to avenge herself for the shame and ignominy
of having loved, not wisely but too well.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is REVERSED and the
appellant is ACQUITTED upon reasonable doubt, with costs <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
