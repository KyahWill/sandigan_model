of Tax Appeals dated May 24, 1969, in C.T.A. Case No. 1629, entitled 
"<em>FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE</em>," 
which reversed the decision of petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue 
holding private respondent Fireman's Fund Insurance Company liable for the 
payment of the amount of P81<span class="GramE">,406.87</span> </span>as 
<span>documentary stamp taxes and compromise penalties for the years 1952 to 
1958.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Private respondent is a resident foreign insurance 
corporation organized under the laws of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>United 
States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>, authorized and duly 
licensed to do business in the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is a member of the American Foreign Insurance Association, through 
which its business is cleared (Brief for Respondents, pp. 
1-2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The antecedent facts of this case are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From January, 1952 to December, 1958, herein private 
respondent Fireman's Fund </span><span>Insurance Company </span><span>entered 
into </span><span>various insurance con;</span><span>tracts involving casualty, 
fire and marine risks, for which the corresponding insurance policies were 
issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>From January, 1952 to 1956, 
</span><span>documentary</span><span> stamps</span><span> </span><span>were 
bought and affixed to the monthly statements of policies issued; and from 1957 
to 1958 documentary stamps were bought and affixed to the corresponding pages of 
the policy register, instead of on the insurance policies issued.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On </span><st1:date month="7" day="3" year="1959"><span>July 3, 
1959</span></st1:date><span>, respon;dent company discovered that its monthly 
statements </span><span>of business and </span><span>policy register were 
lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loss was reported to the Building Admi;nistration of 
Ayala Building and the National Bureau of Investigation on </span><st1:date month="7" day="6" year="1959"><span>July 6, 1959</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Herein petitioner was also informed of such loss by respondent company, 
through the latter's auditors, <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gorres</span> and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>, in a letter 
dated </span><st1:date month="7" day="14" year="1959"><span>July 14, 
1959</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After conducting an inves;tigation 
of said loss, petitioner's examiner ascertained that respond;ent company failed 
to </span><span>affix </span><span>the required documentary stamps to the 
insurance policies issued by it and failed to preserve its accounting records 
within the time prescribed by Section </span><span>337 </span><span>of the 
Revenue Code by using loose </span><span>leaf forms </span><span>as registers of 
documentary stamps without written authority from the Commissioner of Internal 
Revenue as required by Section 4 of Revenue Regulations No. <span class="GramE">V-1.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>As a consequence </span><span>of 
</span><span>these findings, petitioner, in a letter dated December 
</span><span>7, </span><span>1962, assessed and demanded from petitioner the 
payment of documentary stamp taxes </span><span>for the </span><span>years 1952 
to </span><span>1958 </span><span>in the total amount of P</span><span>79,806.87 
</span><span>and plus compromise penalties, a total </span><span>of 
P81,406.87.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Commissioner of Internal </span><span>Revenue.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>The 
assailed decision reads in part:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>''The affixture of documentary stamps to papers <em>other than those 
authorized by law</em> is not tanta;mount to failure to pay the same.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It is true that the mode of affixing the stamps as prescribed by law was 
not followed, but the fact remains that the documentary stamps corresponding to 
the various insurance policies were purchased and paid by petitioner.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There is no legal justification for respondent to require petitioner to 
pay again the documentary stamp tax which it had already paid.<span>&nbsp; </span>To 
sustain respondent's stand would require petitioner to pay the same tax 
twice.<span>&nbsp; </span>If at all, petitioner should be proceeded against for 
failure to comply with the requirement of affixing the documentary stamps to the 
taxable insurance poli;cies and not for failure to pay the tax.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(See Sec. 239 and 332, Rev. Code).<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"It should be observed that the law allows the affixture of 
documentary stamps 'to such other paper as may be indicated by law or 
regulations as the proper recipient of the stamp.' It appears from this 
provision that <span class="GramE">respondent</span> has authority to allow 
documentary stamps to be affixed to papers other than the documents or 
instruments taxed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although the practice adopted by petitioner in 
affixing the documentary stamps to the business statements and policy register 
was without specific permission from respondent but only on the strength of his 
ruling given to Wise &amp; Company (see Peti;tioner's Memorandum, p. 176, CTA 
rec.; p. 24, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.), one of the general agents of 
petitioner, however, considering that petitioner actually purchased the 
documentary stamps, affixed them to the business statements and policy register 
and cancelled the stamps by perforating them, we hold that petitioner cannot be 
held liable to pay again the same tax.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"With respect to the 'compromise penalties' in the total sum of 
P1<span class="GramE">,600.00</span>, suffice it to say that penalties cannot be 
imposed in the absence of a showing that petitioner consented thereto.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>A compromise implies agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the offer is rejected by 
the taxpayer, as in this case, respond;ent cannot enforce it except through a 
criminal action.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <em>Comm. of Int. Rev. vs. 
Abad</em>, L-19627, June 27, 1968.)"</span> (CTA Decision, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 20;-21).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by respondent Court of Tax Appeals, under 
the above-quoted provisions of law, documentary tax is deemed paid by:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(a) the purchase of documentary stamps; (b) affixture of documentary 
stamps to the document or instrument taxed or to such other paper <span>as may 
</span>be indicated by law or regulations; and (c) cancel<span>lation of the 
stamps as required by </span><span>law </span><span>(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 18).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It will be observed however, that the over-riding purpose of these 
provisions of law is the collection of taxes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The three steps 
above-mentioned are but the means to that end.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, the purchase 
of the stamps is the form of payment made; the affixture thereof on the document 
or instrument taxed is to insure that the corresponding tax has been paid for 
such document while the cancellation of the stamps is to obviate the possibility 
that said stamps will be reused for similar documents for similar purposes.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there appears to be no dispute on the fact 
that the documentary stamps corresponding to the various policies were purchased 
and paid for by the respondent Company.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither is there any 
argument that the <span>same </span>were cancelled as required by law.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In fact such were the findings of petitioner's examiner <span class="SpellE">Amando</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Melgar</span> who stated as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote>"Investigation disclosed that the subject insurance company is a 
duly organized corporation doing business in the 
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It keeps the necessary books of accounts and other accounting 
<span>records needed by the business.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further </span>verifica;tion 
revealed <span>that it has, since July, 1959, been using a 'HASLER' franking 
machine, Model F-88, which stamps the documentary stamps on the duplicates of 
the policies issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>Prior to the acqui</span>sition of the said 
machine, <em>the company buy its stamps by allowing the Manager to issue a 
Manager’s check drawn against the National City Bank of 
<st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state> and payable to the City 
Treasurer of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.&nbsp; It was also 
found out that during this period (1952 to 1958), the total purchases of 
documentary stamps amounted to P77,837.67, while the value of the used stamps 
lost amounted to P65.901.11</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Verification with the files 
revealed that most of the monthly statements of business and registers of 
documentary stamps corresponding to insurance policies issued were missing while 
some where the punched documentary stamps affixed were small in amount are still 
intact.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The taxpayer was found to be negligent in the preservation and 
keeping of its records.<span>&nbsp; </span>Al;though the loss was found by the 
company's private investigator (see attached true copies of his reports) was not 
an 'Inside Job,' still the company should be held liable for its negligence, it 
appearing that the said records were placed in a bodega, where almost all 
patrons of the coffee shop nearby could see them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The company also 
viola;ted the provision of Section 221 of the National Internal Revenue Code 
which provides that the documentary stamps should be affixed and cancelled on 
the duplicates of bonds and policies issued.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>In this case, the 
said stamps were affixed on the register of documentary stamps</em>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(pp. 35-36, BIR rec.; Underscoring supplied.)" <span class="GramE">(CTA 
Decision, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
18-19.)</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Such findings were confirmed by the Memorandum of Acting 
Commis<span>sioner of Internal Revenue Jose B. <span class="SpellE">Lingad</span>, 
dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="7" year="1962"><span>November 
</span><span>7, </span><span>1962</span></st1:date><span> </span><span>to the 
Chief, Business </span><span>Tax </span><span>Division, which 
states:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"The records show that the FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY 
allegedly paid P77,837.67 in documentary stamp taxes for the policies of 
insu;rance issued by it for the years 1952 to 1958 but could only present as 
proof of payment P11,936.56 of said taxes as the rest of the amount of 
P65,901.11 were lost due to robbery.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon veri;fication of this 
payment however it was found that the FIREMAN'S FUND INSURANCE COMPANY affixed 
the documentary stamps not on the individual insu<span>rance policies issued by 
it but on a monthly state</span>ment of business and a register of documentary 
stamps, the <span>use </span>of which was not authorized by this Office.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It was claimed that the same procedure was used in the case of the lost 
documentary stamps aforementioned.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>As </span>this practice 
is irregular and the remaining records are not conclusive proofs of the payment 
of the corresponding documentary <span>stamp tax on the policies, the 
</span>FIREMAN'S FUND <span>AND INSURANCE </span><span>COMPANY is still liable 
</span><span>for the payment of the documentary stamp taxes on the policies 
found not affixed with stamps." <span class="GramE">(Original BIR Record, p. 
87).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Later, respondent <span>Court </span>of Tax Appeals correctly 
observed that the purchase of documentary stamps and their being affixed to the 
monthly statements of business and policy registers were also admitted by 
counsel for the Government as could clearly be gleaned from his Memorandum 
submitted to the respondent Court.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Decision, 
CTA <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp<span>. 
4-5).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, all investigations made by the petitioner show the same 
factual findings that respondent company purchased documentary stamps for 
<span>the </span>various policies it has issued <span>for the </span>period in 
<span>question </span>although it <span>has </span>attached the same on 
documents not authorized by law.</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no argument to petitioner's contention that the insurance 
policies with the corresponding documentary stamps affixed are the <span>best 
</span><span>evidence </span>to prove payment of said documentary stamp 
tax.<span>&nbsp; </span>This rule however does not preclude the admissibility of 
other proofs <span>which </span>are <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> and 
of considerable weight, such as:<span>&nbsp; </span>copies of the applications for 
manager's checks, copies of the manager's check vouchers of the bank showing the 
purchases of documentary stamps cor;responding to the various insurance policies 
issued during the years 1952-1958 duly and properly identified <span>by 
</span>the witnesses for respondent company during the hearing and admitted by 
the <span>respondent Court of Tax Appeals (Brief for </span><span>Respondent, 
</span><span>p. 15).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is a general rule in the interpretation of statutes 
levying taxes or duties, that in case of doubt, such statutes are to be 
construed most strongly against the government and in favor of the subjects or 
citizens, because burdens are not to be imposed, nor presumed to be imposed 
beyond what statutes expressly and clearly import (<em>Manila Railroad Co. v. 
Collector of Customs</em>, 52 Phil. 950 [1929]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">There appears to be no question that the purpose of imposing 
documentary stamp taxes is to raise revenue and the corresponding amount has 
already been paid <span>by </span>respondent and has actually become part of the 
revenue of the government.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, it is evi;dent that 
the affixture of the stamps on documents not authorized by law is not attended 
by bad faith as the <span>practice was </span>adopted from the authority granted 
to <span>Wise &amp; Company, </span>one of respondent's general agents (CTA 
Decision, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 20).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Indeed, petitioner argued that such authority was not given to respondent 
company specifically, but under the general principle of agency, where the acts 
of the agents bind the principal, the conclusion is inescapable that the 
justifica;tion for the acts of the agents may also be <span>claimed </span>for 
the acts of the principal itself (Brief for the Respondents, pp. 12-13).</p>
<p class="BODY">Be that <span>as </span>it <span>may, </span>there is no 
justification for the government which has already <span>realized </span>the 
revenue which is the object of the imposition of subject stamp tax, to require 
the payment of the same tax for the same documents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Enshrined in 
our basic legal principles is the time honored doctrine that no person shall 
unjustly enrich himself <span>at </span>the expense of another.<span>&nbsp; </span>It 
goes without saying that the government is not exempted from the application of 
this doctrine <span>(<em>Ramie </em></span><em>Textiles, Inc. v. Mathay 
Sr.</em>, 89 SCRA 587 [1979]).</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Under the circumstances, this court RESOLVED to DISMISS this 
</span>petition <span>and to AFFIRM the assailed decision of the Court of Tax 
Ap;peals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
