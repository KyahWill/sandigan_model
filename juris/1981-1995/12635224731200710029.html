In Civil Case No. 604-B, entitled "Margarita D. Vda. de Imperio, et al. 
vs. Municipal Government of San Miguel, Bulacan, et al.", the then Court
 of First Instance of Bulacan, on April 28, 1978, rendered judgment 
holding herein petitioner municipality liable to private respondents, as
 follows:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in 
favor of the plaintiffs and against the defendant Municipal Government 
of San Miguel, Bulacan, represented by Mayor Mar Marcelo G. Aure and its
 Municipal Treasurer: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "1.  ordering the partial revocation of the Deed of Donation 
signed by the deceased Carlos Imperio in favor of the Municipality of 
San Miguel, Bulacan, dated October 27, 1947 insofar as Lots Nos. 1, 2, 
3, 4 and 5, Block 11 of Subdivision Plan Psd-20831 are concerned, with 
an aggregate total area of 4,646 square meters, which lots are among 
those covered and described under TCT No. T-1831 of the Register of 
Deeds of Bulacan in the name of the Municipal Government of San Miguel, 
Bulacan; </p>
    <p> "2.  ordering the defendant to execute the corresponding Deed of
 Reconveyance over the aforementioned five lots in favor of the 
plaintiffs in the proportion of the undivided one-half (1/2) share in 
the name of plaintiffs Margarita D. Vda. de Imperio, Adoracion, Rodolfo,
 Conrado, Ernesto, Alfredo, Carlos, Jr. and Juan, all surnamed Imperio, 
and the remaining undivided one-half (1/2) share in favor of 
plaintiff-spouses Marcelo E. Pineda and Lucila Pongco; </p>
    <p> "3.  ordering the defendant municipality to pay to the 
plaintiffs in the proportion mentioned in the immediately preceding 
paragraph the sum of P64,440.00 corresponding to the rentals it has 
collected from the occupants for their use and occupation of the 
premises from 1970 up to and including 1975, plus interest thereon at 
the legal rate from January 1970 until fully paid; </p>
    <p> "4.  ordering the restoration of ownership and possession over 
the five lots in question in favor of the plaintiffs in the same 
proportion aformentioned; </p>
    <p> "5.  ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiffs the sum of P3,000.00 for attorney's fees; and to pay the cost of suit. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> "The counterclaim of the defendant is hereby ordered dismissed for lack of evidence presented to substantiate the same. </p>
  <p> "SO ORDERED." (pp. 11-12, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing judgment became final when herein petitioner's appeal was 
dismissed due to its failure to file the record on appeal on time. The 
dismissal was affirmed by the then Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 
SP-12118 and by this Court in G.R. No. 59938. Thereafter, herein private
 respondents moved for issuance of a writ of execution for the 
satisfaction of the judgment. Respondent judge, on July 27, 1982, issued
 an order, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Considering that an entry of judgment had already been made on June 14, 1982 in G.R. No. L-59938 and; </p>
  <p> "Considering further that there is no opposition to plaintiffs' motion for execution dated July 23, 1982, </p>
  <p> "Let a writ of execution be so issued, as prayed for in the aforestated motion." (p. 10, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner, on July 30, 1982, filed a Motion to Quash the writ of 
execution on the ground that the municipality's property or funds are 
all public funds exempt from execution. The said motion to quash was, 
however, denied by the respondent judge in an order dated August 23, 
1982 and the alias writ of execution stands in full force and effect.
</p><p>
On September 13, 1982, respondent judge issued an order which in part, states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is clear and evident from the foregoing that defendant has 
more than enough funds to meet its judgment obligation. Municipal 
Treasurer Miguel C. Roura of San Miguel, Bulacan and Provincial 
Treasurer of Bulacan Agustin O. Talavera are therefor hereby ordered to 
comply with the money judgment rendered by Judge Agustin C. Bagasao 
against said municipality. In like manner, the municipal authorities of 
San Miguel, Bulacan are like­wise ordered to desist from plaintiffs' 
legal possession of the property already returned to plaintiffs by 
virtue of the alias writ of execution. </p>
  <p> "Finally, defendants are hereby given an inextendible period of 
ten (10) days from receipt of a copy of this order by the Office of the 
Provincial Fiscal of Bulacan within which to submit their written 
compliance." (p. 24, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the treasurers (provincial and municipal) failed to comply with the
 order of September 13, 1982, respondent judge issued an order for their
 arrest and that they will be released only upon compliance thereof.
</p><p>
Hence, the present petition on the issue whether the funds of the 
Municipality of San Miguel, Bulacan, in the hands of the provincial and 
municipal treasurers of Bulacan and San Miguel, respectively, are public
 funds which are exempt from execution for the satisfaction of the money
 judgment in Civil Case No. 604-B.
</p><p>
Well settled is the rule that public funds are not subject to levy and 
execution. The reason for this was explained in the case of Municipality
 of Paoay vs. Manaois, 86. Phil. 629 "that they are held in trust for 
the people, intended and used for the accomplishment of the purposes for
 which municipal corporations are created, and that to subject said 
properties and public funds to execution would materially impede, even 
defeat and in some instances destroy said purpose." And, in Tantoco vs. 
Municipal Council of Iloilo, 49 Phil. 52, it was held that "it is the 
settled doctrine of the law that not only the public property but also 
the taxes and public revenues of such corporations cannot be seized 
under execution against them, either in the treasury or when in transit 
to it. Judgments rendered for taxes, and the proceeds of such judgments 
in the hands of officers of the law, are not subject to execution unless
 so declared by statute." Thus, it is clear that all the funds of 
petitioner municipality in the possession of the Municipal Treasurer of 
San Miguel, as well as those in the possession of the Provincial 
Treasurer of Bulacan, are also public funds and as such they are exempt 
from execution.
</p><p>
Besides, Presidential Decree No. 477, known as "The Decree on Local Fiscal Administration", Section 2 (a), provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 2. <em>Fundamental Principles</em>. - Local government 
financial affairs, transactions, and operations shall be governed by the
 fundamental principles set forth hereunder: </p>
  <p> "(a) No money shall be paid out of the treasury except in 
pursuance of a lawful appropriation or other specific statutory 
authority. </p>
  <p align="center"> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Otherwise stated, there must be a corresponding appropriation in the
 form of an ordinance duly passed by the Sangguniang Bayan before any 
money of the municipality may be paid out. In the case at bar, it has 
not been shown that the Sangguniang Bayan has passed an ordinance to 
this effect.
  </p>
<p>
Furthermore, Section 15, Rule 39 of the New Rules of Court, outlines the procedure for the enforcement of money judgment:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(a)  By levying on all the property of the debtor, whether real 
or personal, not otherwise exempt from execution, or only on such part 
of the property as is sufficient to satisfy the judgment and accruing 
cost, if he has more than sufficient property for the purpose; </p>
  <p> "(b)  By selling the property levied upon; </p>
  <p> "(c)  By paying the judgment-creditor so much of the proceeds as will satisfy the judgment and accruing costs; and </p>
  <p> "(d)  By delivering to the judgment-debtor the excess, if any, unless otherwise directed by judgment or order of the court."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The foregoing has not been followed in the case at bar.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the petition is granted and the order of respondent judge, 
dated July 27, 1982, granting issuance of a writ of execution; the alias
 writ of execution, dated July 27, 1982; and the order of respondent 
judge, dated September 13, 1982, directing the Provincial Treasurer of 
Bulacan and the Municipal Treasurer of San Miguel, Bulacan to comply 
with the money judgments, are SET ASIDE; and respondents are hereby 
enjoined from implementing the writ of execution.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
