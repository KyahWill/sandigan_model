<p class="2Q">"Meanwhile, after the conclusion of the original operating
contract between ABC and Operators Inc., it appears that Operators Inc.
commenced with its operations in the manufacture of plaintiff's <span class="SpellE">chiclet</span> and bubble gum products, utili<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">zing for this purpose the plaintiff's site
and establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In December, 1954, <span class="SpellE">Eu</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Leh</span> became the general manager

improving the quality of the chewing gum which it was manufacturing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, Operators Inc. took over

<p class="2Q">"In March 1955-i.e., some eight (8) months after the
conclusion of the Tripartite Agreement-it appears that differences had arisen
between the two defendants on the utilization of plaintiff's establishment and

plaintiff's premises in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Paranaque</span></st1:place></st1:city>,

divide the factory building into two portions, the northern-portion having been
assigned to Operators Inc. and the southern portion to Associated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties also divided the ABC's
facilities, equipment and furniture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Chevrolet truck was assigned to Operators and the <st1:city><st1:place>Fargo</st1:place></st1:city>

machinery, however, which was only for the manufacture of chewing gum, was
assigned to defendant Operators.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
arrangement was approved by the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Associated Biscuit was allowed the use of the sugar <span class="SpellE">pulverizer</span>,
the water pump and the <span class="SpellE">airconditioning</span> facilities, on
condition that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">would pay </span>the
expenses of maintenance, before the arrival of its own machinery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the foregoing division of factory
premises, equipment and furniture, the parties took possession of their
respective shares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Operators
continued with its manufacture of <span class="SpellE">chiclet</span> and chewing
gum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Associated commenced its
manufacture of biscuits with the machinery it had imported from <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>, awaiting meanwhile the arrival of the machinery

<p class="2Q">"Meanwhile also, since the two defendants-Operators and
Associated-had both undertaken to pay ABC's obligation, owing to its various
creditors-accounts which had been outstanding before the entry into the
agreements-and which, in fact, were the motivating factors for the entry of the
plaintiff into the operating agreements-arrangements were made between the
parties with the China Banking Corporation whereby the defendants would share
fifty-fifty in the payment by monthly installments of the P110,000.00 unpaid
balance of the loan by the bank to plaintiff (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">3-A-Operators).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
arrangement was religiously complied with by Operators Inc. which paid P1<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> monthly, making a total payment of more than
P100,000.00 including interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

failed to make good its commitments to pay its share of P55<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

that there was a breach of the aforesaid agreements owing to the failure of
Associated Biscuit to pay its share in American Biscuit's indebtedness to its
(American Biscuit's) creditors, and the failure of Associated Biscuit to pay
its share in the monthly overhead expenses of American Biscuit, in addition to
the removal by Associated Biscuit of machineries used in the business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>American Biscuit maintained that the payment

Biscuit had deprived it of its contractual share in the latter's dollar

submitted a counterclaim on the contention that it was American Biscuit that
breached the Tripartite Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
filed a cross-claim against Operators for the latter's alleged failure to
comply with their agreement affording Associated Biscuit the right to half of
American Biscuit's buildings, furniture, fixtures, and rolling equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Associated Biscuit likewise alleged that Operators

Associated and Operators as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors are

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The fundamental question
is whether or not Associated Biscuit violated the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Contract and the Tripartite Agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On this question, both the trial and appellate courts were agreed that
Associated Biscuit failed to comply with its dual contractual commitments of
settling the financial obligations of American Biscuits and of paying its
monthly overhead expenses. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It is a
finding that finds ample support in the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals pointed out that (1) on
June 23, 1955, American Biscuit had asked Associated Biscuit and Operators,
under </span>pain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of rescission of the
contract, to satisfy the claims of its creditors, but in spite of assurances by
Associated Biscuit, nothing tangible came about, leading to the tripartite
conference of August 13, 1955.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, the parties arrived at an arrangement that obliged Associated and
Operators to </span>make <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a promissory
note payable on March 13, 1957.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
again, this was not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">aid; and (2) in both the letter of June 23,
1955 and the tripartite conference of August 23, 1955, American Biscuit
demanded from Associated Biscuit the payment of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
monthly overhead expenses but Associated made payments good only up to
February, </span>1955, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and the payment
itself was made only in October, 1955.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These </span>are factual findings that bind this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">is</span> violated only
upon an actual execution of any judgment against American Biscuit and a
physical takeover of the company's properties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Such a stand is not only
patently against the clear wordings of the Operating Contract, it is
absurd.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be observed that
Associated Biscuit itself outlined in its brief that American Biscuit had
entered into the Operating Contract at </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">time when its creditors
had already commenced foreclosure proceedings upon its properties and at a time

public auction.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> That was why Operators and Associated

<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by and
through the payment and satisfaction of the [creditors'] claims." The
"execution of judgments" and the "consequent closure of the
candy department" were precisely the consequences American Biscuit had
feared and foreseen, for which Operators and Associated Biscuit were made to
assume the liabilities they now deny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, when there is insufficient payment, as factually shown in the
cases at bar, there is a violation of the Operating Contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">For one of the essential
ingredients of payment as a mode of extinguishing obligations is integrity,
that </span>is, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the payment must be

claim that its share in the dollar quota of American Biscuit is a contractual
right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that, as found by the
appellate court, American Biscuit did not refuse to share the quota with
Associated Biscuit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, in its
very brief, Associated Biscuit avers:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Honoring the adjustments, American Biscuit Company, Inc. allowed
petitioner to use half of its dollar quota as petitioner prepared to operate
the biscuit department in 1955; and petitioner had enjoyed the quota equally
with the Operators Incorporated until June 1957, when the quota was suspended
by the Central Bank for failure of American Biscuit Company, Inc. to file the
required production report.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

contractual undertaking and its efforts were wanting in that regard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, even as Associated Biscuit was
actually sharing in the quota allocations until June, 1957, it, as late as
March, 1957, had continuously failed to satisfy the claims of American Biscuit's
creditors and to pay the overhead expenses of the biscuit company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These are hard facts Associated Biscuit
