				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, Jx:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Punla</span>
seeks to disbar lawyer <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
on the grounds of mental dishonesty, moral delinquency and lack of integrity.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was the private prosecutor in
Criminal Case No. 49-74 of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>
and Criminal Case No. 366 of the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>,
both in <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, which were cases for oral
defamation filed by <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> A. Flores against <span class="SpellE">Punla</span> who was represented by lawyer <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Gaddi</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal judges of <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span> both inhibited themselves from trying those cases.
Accordingly, the District Judge designated Municipal Judge Salvador T. <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> to hear those
cases in <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the termination of the preliminary investigation, Judge <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> got sick. On <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1976</st1:date>, he requested the Executive Judge that the preliminary
investigation of the oral defamation cases be held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>. The parties agreed that the
proceedings be conducted in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the preliminary investigation and after he had issued a
warrant for the arrest of <span class="SpellE">Punla</span>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Calma</span> assigned Special Counsel Andres F. <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> to prosecute the cases. <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
was to act as private prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial on the merits and after he had testified, <st1:place>Flores</st1:place>,
the offended party, died. The defense counsel moved for the striking out of his
testimony. In his opposition to that motion, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
signed for and in behalf of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the defense moved for the nullification of the
proceedings in the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> on the
grounds of improper venue and lack of authority from either the Court of First
Instance or this Court to conduct the preliminary investigation and trial in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the suggestion of the trial fiscal, the cases were heard in <span class="SpellE">Masantol</span> and <span class="SpellE">Macabebe</span>,
respectively, pending the resolution in this Court of Judge <span class="SpellE">Calma's</span>
request for "temporary change of venue".</p>

<p class="BODY">When Criminal Case No. 49-74 was called for trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">Masantol</span>,
the defense counsel orally moved for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">nullification
of the proceedings in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>. <u>In the presence of
the trial fiscal</u>, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> opposed that motion. The
municipal judge then ordered the parties to submit their arguments in writing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Soriano</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> filed separate oppositions in Criminal Cases
Nos. 49-74 and 366. He signed his oppositions in this manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Respectfully,</blockquote>

<blockquote>ANDRES F. PANGILINAN</blockquote>

<blockquote>CLEMENTE M. SORIANO"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, this Court issued a resolution on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1977</st1:date> declaring as void all the proceedings
already had in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span> (Administrative Matter No.
1982-MC). However, on <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1977</st1:date>
this Court, acting on <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> motion, reconsidered
that reso­lution and approved the agreement of the parties that the oral
defamation cases be tried and decided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Calma</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>. This Court considered as valid all the
proceedings conducted therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Because </span>he signed
the two oppositions for the prosecution, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was
charged with falsification of public documents in the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (Criminal Cases Nos. 73-389-M and
73-390-M). The two <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, both dated May 23,
1978, alleged that <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> made it appear that the
trial fiscal participated in the preparation and filing of the aforesaid
oppositions where in fact he did not authorize their preparation and filing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="11">November
 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">28, </span>1978</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Punla</span>, through <span class="SpellE">Gaddi</span>, filed the instant complaint for disbarment, charging
<span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> with "<span class="SpellE">wilfull</span>
falsi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">fication, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">chicanery and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">lack </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of integrity in his
dealings with the parties and the court". Attached to the complaint is a
copy of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Special Counsel </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Pangilinan's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> letter of April 21, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">1977 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">addressed to the provincial fiscal stating that the said opposition(s)
to motion was prepared by <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> without <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan's</span> consent and intervention and that "the
same is the sole responsibility" of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
affirmed that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he </span>had acted
within the scope of his authority as private prosecutor when he prepared,
signed and filed the oppositions concerned. We referred the case to the
Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">While </span>that investigation
was being conducted or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">December
 15, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> acquitted <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> of falsification. It found that the preparation and
filing of the pleadings con­cerned were "not only </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">known </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">the trial fiscal </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">but were even authorized by him".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the instant disbarment case is based on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>same facts for which <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> was acquitted of falsification of public documents,
we agree with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Solicitor </span>General
that this case should likewise be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the questioned pleadings might have been prepared by <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Soriano</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> alone, thus prompting </span><span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> to label them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">as </span><span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> "sole
responsibility"; <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> was not really
ignorant of <span class="SpellE">Soriano's</span> inten<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">tion to file those pleadings. He was in court when <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>
orally opposed the defense counsel's motions. <span class="GramE">(See People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Beriales</span>,
L-39962, March 3, 1977, 76 SCRA 42.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">"The power to disbar attorneys ought always to be exercised
with great caution, and only in clear cases of misconduct which seriously
affects the standing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>character
of the lawyer as an officer of the court and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

any form of disciplinary action.</p>
