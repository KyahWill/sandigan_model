<p class="BODY">On March 21, 1953, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>
obtained a Torrens title in his name from the <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
Registry of Property, numbered T-1346.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He died on April 20, 1973, at the age of 81 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>,
predeceased him, dying at age 70 on July 16, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had no children.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it appears that Modesto was survived by two (2) illegitimate
children named Dorothea <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> Ado and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two borrowed P18,000.00 from Jesus <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As security <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> they mortgaged to <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>
their father's property, Lot 13-C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the "Loan Agreement with Real Estate Mortgage" executed between them
and <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> on October 30, 1975, they described
themselves as the absolute co-owners of Lot 13-C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A relative, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>, signed the agreement as a witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dorothea and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> failed to pay
their loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result, <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> caused the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage
over Lot 13-C on June 29, 1977 and acquired the land at the auction sale as the
highest bidder.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After the foreclosure sale, Dorothea and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
executed a deed of Extrajudicial Partition dated June 21, 1978, in which they
adjudicated the same Lot 13-C unto themselves in equal shares <i><span style="">pro</span></i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><i>indiviso</i></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 25, 1978 <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> consolidated
his ownership over Lot 13-C, the mortgagors having failed to redeem the same
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, and had the latter's
title (No. T-1346 in the name of Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>)
cancelled and another issued in his name, TCT No. T-15121.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">About a month later, or on November 24, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>
-- who, as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, was an instrumental witness
in the deed of mortgage executed by Dorothea and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> on October 30, 1975 -- filed a complaint with
the Regional Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City against Jesus <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> and his spouse, <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
docketed as Civil Case No. V-4188, and assigned to Branch 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint, the plaintiffs prayed
that the latter's title over Lot 13-C, TCT No. T-15121, be cancelled and they
be declared co-owners of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
grounded their cause of action upon their alleged discovery on or about
November 20, 1978 of two (2) wills, one executed on February 11, 1958 by
Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>, and the other, executed on October
29, 1957 by his wife, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro's</span>
will allegedly bequeathed to <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>, and to Dorothea and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>, in equal shares pro <span class="SpellE">indiviso</span>,
all of said Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro's</span> "interests,
rights and properties, real and personal ** as her net share from (the)
conjugal partnership property with her husband, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>
**." Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>' will, on the other hand,
bequeathed to Dorothea and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> (his illegitimate children) all his interests in his
conjugal partnership with Victoria "as well as his own capital property
brought by him to (his) marriage with his said wife.''<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial, the parties stipulated on certain facts,
including the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) that the property in question was registered before the
mortgage in the name of the late Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>,
married to Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>, (covered by) TCT No.
1346, issued on March 21, 1953;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) that the wills above described were probated only after the
filing of the case (No. V-4188);</p>

<p class="BODY">3) that <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Villanueva and <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> are not children
of either Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> or Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>;</p>

<p class="BODY">4) that the lot in question is not expressly mentioned in the
will; and</p>

<p class="BODY">5) that TCT No. 15121 exists, and was issued in favor of
defendant-spouses Jesus <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court,
where they succeeded only in having the award of actual and moral damages
deleted, the judgment of the Regional Trial Court having been otherwise
affirmed <i><span style="">in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment of the Appellate Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Villanueva appealed to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her co-plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>, did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question is, what right was acquired by <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Villanueva over Lot 13-C and the improvements
thereon standing by virtue of Victoria <span class="SpellE">Camorro's</span> last
will and testament giving to her all of said Victoria's <span style="">"<i>interests, rights and properties, real and personal ** as her
net share from (the) conjugal partnership property with her husband, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> **.</i>" </span>She is, admittedly, not named
an heiress in Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>' will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certain it is that the land itself, Lot 13-C, was not
"conjugal partnership property" of Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>
and her husband, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was the latter's exclusive, private
property, which he had inherited from his parents -- <span class="SpellE">Graciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nicolasa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bunsa</span>, the original owners of the property -- registered
solely in his name, under TCT T-1346.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether Modesto succeeded to the property prior or subsequent to his
marriage to Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span> -- the record being
unfortunately none too clear on the point -- is inconsequential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The property should be regarded as his own
exclusively, as a matter of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
what Article 148 of the Civil Code clearly decrees:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that to be considered as "the exclusive
property of each spouse" is <i><span style="">inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style="">,
"</span>that which is brought to the marriage as his or her own," or
"that which each acquires, during the marriage, by lucrative title."
Thus, even if it be assumed that Modesto's acquisition by succession of Lot
13-C took place during his marriage to Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>,
the lot would nonetheless be his "exclusive property" because
acquired by him, "during the marriage, by lucrative title."</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span> died on July
16, 1971, about two (2) years ahead of her husband, Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>,
exclusive owner of Lot 13-C, who passed away on April 20, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Victoria never therefore inherited any part
of Lot 13-C and hence, had nothing of Lot 13-C to bequeath by will or otherwise
to <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Villanueva or anybody else.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem, however, that there are improvements standing on
Lot 13-C, and it is to these improvements that <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Villanueva's claims are directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question then is, whether or not the improvements are conjugal property, so
that Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span> may be said to have acquired a
right over them by succession, as voluntary heir of Victoria <span class="SpellE">Comorro</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Code says that improvements, "whether for utility
or adornment, made on the separate property of the spouses through advancements
from the partnership or through the industry of either the husband or the wife,
belong to the conjugal partnership," and buildings "constructed, at
the expense of the partnership, during the marriage on land belonging to one of
the spouses, also pertain to the partnership, but the value of the land shall
be reimbursed to the spouse who owns the same."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Proof, therefore, is needful of the time of the making or construction of the improvements
and the source of the funds used <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, in order
to determine the character of the improvements as belonging to the conjugal
partnership or to one spouse separately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No such proof was presented or <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> Villanueva or any one else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is certain is that the land on which the
improvements stand was the exclusive property of Modesto <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>
and that where, as here, property is registered in the name of one spouse only
and there is no showing of when precisely the property was acquired, the
presumption is that it belongs exclusively to said spouse.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not therefore possible to declare the improvements to be conjugal in
character.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet another consideration precludes relief to <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Villanueva and that is, that when Lot 13-C was mortgaged to Jesus <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>, the title was free of any lien, encumbrance or
adverse claim presented by or for <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span>
Villanueva or anybody else, and that when <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>
subsequently consolidated his ownership over Lot 13-C and obtained title in his
name, the Registry of Deeds contained no record of any lien, encumbrance or
adverse claim affecting the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Bernas</span>' mode of acquisition of
ownership over the property, i.e., by a mortgage sale, appears in all respects
to be regular, untainted by any defect whatsoever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bernas</span> must
therefore be deemed to have acquired indefeasible and clear title to Lot 13-C
which cannot be defeated or negated by claims subsequently arising and of which
he had no knowledge or means of knowing prior to their assertion and
ventilation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it bears stressing that the conclusion of the
Intermediate Appellate Court that the evidence establishes that the property in
question was the exclusive property of one spouse, not conjugal, is a factual
one which, absent any satisfactory showing of palpable error or grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the Appellate Court in reaching it, is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Intermediate Appellate
Court subject of this appeal, being in accord with the evidence and applicable
law and jurisprudence, is AFFIRMED, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
