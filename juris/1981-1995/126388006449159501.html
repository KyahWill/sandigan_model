Mikael Malmstedt (hereinafter referred to as the accused) </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">charged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of La Trinidad, Benguet,
Branch 10, in Criminal Case No. 89-CR-0663, for violation of Section 4, Art. II
of Republic Act 6425, as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of
1972, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The factual background
of the case is</span> as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused Mikael Malmstedt,
a Swedish national, entered the Philippines for the third time in December 1988
as a tourist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had visited the country
sometime in 1982 and 1985.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the evening of 7 May
1989, accused left for Baguio City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
his arrival thereat in the, morning of the following day, he took a bus to
Sagada and stayed in that place for two (2) days.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At around 7:00 o'clock in
the morning of 11 May 1989, accused went to the Nangonogan bus stop Sagada to
catch the first available trip to Baguio City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From Baguio City, accused planned to take a late afternoon trip to
Angeles City, then proceed to Manila to catch his flight out of the country,
scheduled on 13 May 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From Sagada,
accused took a Skyline bus with body number 8005 and Plate number AVC 902.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about 8:00 o'clock in
the morning of that </span><span style="">same </span><span style="">day (11 May
1989).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Captain Alen Vasco, the
Commanding Officer of the First Regional Command (NARCOM) stationed at Camp
Dangwa, ordered his men to set up a temporary checkpoint at</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Kilometer 14, Acop, Tublay, Mountain
Province, for the purpose of checking all vehicles coming from the Cordillera
Region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order to establish a checkp</span><span style="">oint</span><span style=""> in the said area was prompted by persistent reports that vehicles
coming from Sagada were transporting marijuana and other prohibited drugs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, information was received by the
Commanding Officer of NARCOM, that same morning, that a Caucasian coming from
Sagada had in his possession prohibited drugs.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The group composed of
seven (7) NARCOM officers, in coordination with Tublay Police Station, set up a
checkpoint at the designated area at about 10:00 o'clock in the morning and
inspected all vehicles coming from the Cordillera Region.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At about 1:30 o'clock in
the afternoon, the bus where accused </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">riding was
stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Fider and </span>CIC <span style="">Galutan boarded the bus and announced that
they were members of the </span><span style="">NARCOM </span><span style="">and that they would conduct an
inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) NARCOM officers
started their inspection from the front going towards the rear of the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused who was the sole </span><span style="">foreigner </span><span style="">riding the bus was seated at the rear thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the inspection,
CIC Galutan noticed </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">bulge on accused's waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suspecting the bulge on accused's waist to be
a gun, the officer </span>asked for accused's passport <span style="">and other identification papers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>When accused failed to comply, the officer required him <span style="">to bring out whatever </span>it was that was <span style="">bulging on his waist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bulging object turned out to be a pouch
bag and when accused opened the same bag, as </span>ordered, <span style="">the officer noticed four (4)
suspicious-looking objects wrapped in brown packing </span>tape, <span style="">prompting the officer to open one of the
wrapped objects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The wrapped objects
turned </span>out <span style="">to contain hashish, a
</span>derivative of marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, accused was
invited outside the bus for questioning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But before he alighted from the bus, accused stopped to get two (2)
travelling bags from the luggage </span><span style="">carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon stepping out of the
bus, the officers got the bags and opened them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A teddy bear </span>was <span style="">found in
each bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feeling the teddy bears, the
officer noticed that there were </span>bulges inside the same which did not
feel like foam <span style="">stuffing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after the officers had opened the
</span><span style="">bags </span><span style="">that accused finally presented his passport.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accused was then brought
to the headquarters of the NARCOM at Camp Dangwa, La Trinidad, Benguet for
further investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
investigation room, the officers opened the teddy bears and they were found to
also contain, </span>hashish.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Representative samples were taken from the hashish found among the
personal effects of accused and the same were brought to the PC Crime
Laboratory <span style="">for </span>chemical
analysis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the chemistry report,
it was established that the objects examined were hashish, a prohibited drug
which is a derivative of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, an information was filed against accused for violation of the
Dangerous Drugs Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During the arraignment,
accused entered a </span><span style="">plea </span><span style="">of "not guilty." For his defense,
he raised the </span><span style="">issue </span><span style="">of illegal search of his personal
effects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed that the
hashish was planted by the NARCOM officers in his pouch bag </span>and that the
two (2) travelling bags were not owned by him, but were merely entrusted to him
<span style="">by</span> an Australian couple whom he
met in Sagada.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further claimed that
the Australian couple intended to take the same bus with him but because there
were no more seats available <span style="">in </span>said
bus, they decided to take the next ride <span style="">and
as</span><span style="">k</span><span style="">ed </span>accused to take charge of the bags,
and that they would meet each other at the Dangwa Station.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, accused alleged that when the NARCOM officers demanded
for his passport and other identification papers, he handed to one of the
officers his pouch bag which was hanging on his neck containing, among others,
his passport, return ticket to Sweden and other papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officer in turn handed it to <span style="">his </span>companion who brought the bag
outside the bus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When said officer came
back, he charged the accused that there was hashish in the bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was told to get off the bus and his
picture was <span style="">taken </span>with the pouch
bag placed around his neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court <span style="">did not </span>give credence to
accused's defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the accused that the hashish was planted by the NARCOM
officers, was belied by his failure to raise such defense at the earliest
opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When accused <span style="">was, </span>investigated at the Provincial
Fiscal's Office, he did not inform the Fiscal or <span style="">his </span>lawyer that <span style="">the </span>hashish
was planted by the NARCOM officers in his bag.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was<span style=""> only </span>two (2) months
after said investigation when be told his lawyer about said claim, denying
ownership of the two (2) travelling bags as well as having hashish <span style="">in </span>his pouch bag.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span style="">a </span>decision dated 12 October 1989, the
trial court found accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation, of the
Dangerous Drugs Act, specifically Section 4. Art. II of RA 6425, as amended.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The dispositive portion of the decision

life imprisonment and to pay <span style="">a fine </span>of
Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) with subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Seeking the <span style="">reversal of
the decision of the trial court finding him guilty of the crime charged,
accused argues that the search of his personal effects was illegal because it
was made without a search warrant and, therefore, the p</span>rohibited <span style="">drugs which were discovered during the
illegal search are not admissible as evidence against him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the NARCOM officers were not armed with a
search warrant when the search was made over the personal effects of accused,
however, under the circumstances of the case, there was sufficient probable
cause for said officers to believe that accused was then and there committing a
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Probable cause has been defined as such facts and circumstances
which could lead a reasonable, discreet and prudent man to believe that an
offense has been committed, and that the objects sought in connection with the
offense are in the place sought to be searched.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Warrantless search of the personal effects of an accused has been
declared by this Court as valid, because of existence of probable cause, where
the smell of marijuana emanated from a plastic bag owned by the accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
or where the accused was acting suspiciously,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Aside from the persistent
reports received by the NARCOM that vehicles coming from Sagada were
transporting marijuana and other prohibited drugs, their Commanding Officer
also received information that a Caucasian coming from Sagada on that
particular day had prohibited drugs in his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said information was received by the
Commanding Officer of NARCOM the very same morning that accused came down by
bus from Sagada on his way to Baguio City.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When NARCOM received the
information, a few hours before the apprehension of herein accused, that a
Caucasian travelling from Sagada to Baguio City was carrying with him
prohibited drugs, there was no time to obtain a search warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <u>Tangliben</u> <u>case</u>,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the police authorities conducted a
surveillance at the Victory Liner Terminal located at </span>Bgy. <span style="">San Nicolas, San Fernando Pampanga, against
persons engaged in the traffic of dangerous drugs, based on information
supplied by some informers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused
Tangliben who was acting suspiciously and pointed out by an informer was
apprehended and searched by the police authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held that when faced with on-the-spot
information, the police officers had to act quickly and there was no time to
secure a search warrant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It must be observed that,
at first, the NARCOM officers merely conducted a routine check of the bus
(where accused was riding) and the passengers therein, and no extensive search
was initially made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only when one
of the officers noticed a bulge on the waist of accused, during the course of
the inspection, that accused was required to present </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">passport.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of accused
to present his identification papers, when ordered to do so, only managed to
arouse the suspicion of the officer that accused was trying to hide his
identity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For is it not a regular norm
for an innocent man, who has nothing to hide from the authorities, to readily
present his identification papers when required to do so?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The receipt of
information by NARCOM that a Caucasian coming from Sagada had prohibited drugs
in his possession, </span><span style="">plus </span><span style="">the suspicious failure of the accused to
produce his passport, taken together as a whole, led the NARCOM officers to
reasonably believe that the accused was trying to hide something illegal from
the authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From these
circumstances arose a <u>probable</u> <u>cause</u> which justified the
warrantless search that was made on the personal effects of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the acts of the NARCOM officers
in requiring the accused to open his pouch bag and in opening one of the
wrapped objects found inside said bag (which was discovered to contain hashish)
as well as the two (2) travelling bags containing two (2) teddy bears with
hashish stuffed inside them were prompted by accused's own attempt to hide his
identity by refusing to present his passport, and by the information received
by the NARCOM that a Caucasian coming from Sagada had prohibited drugs in his
possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deprive the NARCOM agents
of the ability and facility to act accordingly, including, to search even </span>without
warrant, in the light of such circumstances, would be to sanction impotence and
ineffectiveness in law enforcement, to the detriment of society.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J.</i>: </p>

<p class="BODY">I join Mr. Justice Andres R. Narvasa in his dissent, which I
believe represents the correct application to the facts of this case of the
provisions of the Bill of Rights and the Rules of Court on searches and
seizures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is consistent with my <u>ponencia</u>
in People v. Amminudin, 163 SCRA 402, and also with Alih v. Castro, 151 SCRA
279, the latter being <span style="">a </span>unanimous decision of the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, and <span style="">my </span>dissents in Umil v. Ramos (on
warrantless arrests), 187 SCRA 311, Valmonte v. De Villa (on checkpoints), 178
SCRA 211, 185 SCRA 665, and Guazon v. De Villa (on "zonas"), 181 SCRA
623.</p>

<p class="BODY">I write this separate opinion merely to remark on an observation
made during the deliberation on this case that some members of the Court seem
to be coddling criminals instead of extending its protection to society, which
deserves our higher concern.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inference is that because of our wrong priorities, criminals are being
imprudently let free, to violate our laws again; and it is all our fault.</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing myself to be among those alluded to, I will say without
apology that I do not consider a person a criminal until he is convicted by
final judgment after a fair trial by <span style="">a </span>competent and impartial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Until then, the Constitution bids us to presume
him innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He may seem boorish or
speak crudely or sport tattoos or dress weirdly or otherwise fall short of our
own standards of propriety and decorum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>None of these makes him <span style="">a </span>criminal
although he may <u>look</u> like <span style="">a </span>criminal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is so easy to condemn a person on the <span style="">basis </span>of his appearance but it is
also so <span style="">wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the question before us, it seems to be the inclination of some
judges to wink at an illegal search and seizure <span style="">as </span>long as the suspect has been
actually found in possession of a prohibited article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That fact will retroactively validate the
violation of the Bill of Rights for after all, as they would rationalize, the
suspect <u>is</u> <span style="">a criminal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>What matters
to them is the fact of illegal possession, not the fact of illegal search and
seizure.</p>

<p class="BODY">This kind of thinking takes us back to the intolerant days of
Moncado v. People's Court, 80 Phil. 1, which was discredited in Stonehill v.
Diokno, 20 SCRA 383, even before it was definitely rejected by an express
provision in the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
provision, which has been retained in the present Constitution, again
explicitly declares that any evidence illegally obtained "shall be
inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding."</p>

<p class="BODY">The fruit of the forbidden tree should not be allowed to poison
our system of criminal justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, the search was made at a checkpoint established for the
preposterous reason that the route was being used by marijuana dealers and on
an individual who had something bulging at his waist that excited the soldier's
suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was that probable cause?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>ponencia</u> notes that the military
had advance information that a Caucasian <span style="">was </span>coming from the Sagada with prohibited
drugs in his possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what
the military says now, <u>after</u> the fact, to justify the warrantless
search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so easy to make such <span style="">a </span>claim, and
I <span style="">am </span>surprised
that the majority should readily accept it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion that there was probable cause may have been
influenced by the subsequent discovery that the accused was carrying a prohibited
drug.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is supposed to justify the
soldier's suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it
was the fact of illegal possession that <u>retroactively</u> established the
probable cause that validated the illegal search and <span style="">seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was the fruit
of the forbidden tree that washed clean the tree itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Olmstead v. U.S., 277 U.S. 438, Justice Holmes <span style="">said </span>sixty-four years ago:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x x x </span>It is
desirable that criminals should be detected, and to that end that all available
evidence should be used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
desirable that the government should not itself foster and pay for other
crimes, when they are the means by which the evidence is to be obtained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it pays its officers for having got
evidence by crime, I do not see why it may not as well pay them for getting it
in the same way, and I can attach no importance to protestations of disapproval
if it knowingly accepts and pays and announces that in the future it will pay
for the fruits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have to choose, and
for my part I think it a less evil that some criminals should escape than that
the government should p<span style="">la</span>y<span style=""> </span>an ignoble part.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If by deterring the
government from playing "an ignoble part," I am "coddling
criminals," I welcome the accusation and take pride in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would rather err in favor of the accused
who is impaled with outlawed evidence than exalt order at the price of liberty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined

complainant and the witnesses he may produce, and particularly describing the
place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">It

<p class="BODY">If, on the other hand, a person is <i style=""><span style="">searched without a warrant, or
under circumstances other than those justifying an arrest without warrant in
accordance with law, supra</span></i><span style="">, </span>merely on suspicion that he is engaged in
some felonious enterprise, and in order to discover if he has indeed committed a

<p class="BODY">There is unanimity among the members of the Court upon the
continuing validity of these established principles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the Court is divided as regards the
ultimate conclusions which may properly be derived from the proven facts and
consequently, the manner <span style="">in </span>which
the principles just cited should apply thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proofs of the prosecution and those of the defense are
diametrically at odds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is certain,
however, is that the soldiers had no warrant of arrest when they conducted a
search of Malmstedt's person and the things in his possession at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the Court <i style=""><span style="">a</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>acknowledged
that the soldiers could "not be expected to be armed with a warrant or
arrest nor a search warrant everytime they establish a temporary checkpoint **
(and) no judge would issue them one considering that searching questions have
to be asked before a warrant could be issued." Equally plain is that prior
to the search, a warrantless arrest of Malmstedt could not validly have been
made in accordance with the norms of the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For Malmstedt had not committed, nor was he actually committing or
attempting to commit a crime, in the soldiers' presence, nor did said soldiers
have personal and competent knowledge that Malmstedt had in fact just committed
a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All they had was a suspicion
that Malmstedt might have some prohibited drug on him or in his bags; all they
had was, in the words of the Trial Court, "the hope of intercepting any
dangerous drug being transported," or, as the Office of the Solicitor
General asserts, "information that most of the buses coming ** (from the
Cordillera) were transporting marijuana and other prohibited drugs."</p>

<p class="BODY">This case, is remarkably similar to <i style=""><span style="">Peo. v. Aminnudin,</span></i><span style=""> </span>decided on
July 6, 1988 also by the First Division.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
There, Aminnudin was arrested without a warrant by PC officers as he was
disembarking from an inter­-island vessel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The officers were waiting for him because he was, according to an
informer's report, then transporting marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The search of Aminnudin's bag confirmed the informer's report: the bag
indeed contained marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court nevertheless
held that since the PC officers had failed to procure a search warrant although
they had sufficient time (two days) to do so and therefore, the case presented
no such urgency as to justify a warrantless search, the search of Aminnudin's
person and bag, the seizure of the marijuana and his subsequent arrest were
illegal; and the marijuana was inadmissible in evidence in the criminal action
subsequently instituted against Aminnudin for violating the Dangerous Drugs
Act.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>There are, on the other
hand, other cases adjudicated by this Court in which apparently different
conclusions were reached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is needful
to devote a few words to them so that the relevant constitutional and legal
propositions are not misunderstood.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i style=""><span style="">People</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">v</span></i><span style="">. </span><i style=""><span style="">Claudio</span></i><span style=""> </span>(decision promulgated on April 15, 1988),<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the accused boarded a "Victory Liner" passenger bus going to Olongapo
from Baguio City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She placed the plastic
bag she was carrying at the back of the seat then occupied by Obiña, an INP
member "on Detached Service with the Anti-Narcotics Unit." This
avowedly aroused Obiña's suspicion, and at the first opportunity, and without
Claudio's knowledge, he surreptitiously looked into the plastic bag and noted
that it contained camote tops as well as a package, and that there emanated
from the package the smell of marijuana with which he had become familiar on
account of his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when the bus
stopped at Sta. Rita, and Claudio alighted, Obiña accosted her, showed her his
ID, identified himself as a policeman, and announced his intention to search
her bag which he said contained marijuana because of the distinctive odor
detected by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ignoring her plea --
"Please go with me, let us settle this at home" -- he brought her to
the police headquarters, where examination of the package in Claudio's bag
confirmed his suspicion that it indeed contained marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court held the warrantless arrest under
the circumstances to be lawful, the search justified, and the evidence thus
discovered admissible in evidence against the accused.</p>

two police officers and a <i style=""><span style="">barangay</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">tanod</span></i><span style=""> </span>were conducting a "surveillance

drugs based on information supplied by informers; * * they noticed a person
carrying a red traveling bag; ** who was acting suspiciously;" they asked
him to open the bag; the person did so only after they identified themselves as
peace officers; found in the bag were marijuana leaves wrapped in plastic
weighing one kilogram, more or less; the person was then taken to the police
headquarters at San Fernando, Pampanga, where he was investigated; and an
information was thereafter filed against that person, Tangliben, charging him
with a violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 (RA 6425), as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon these facts it was ruled, citing <i style=""><span style="">Claudio</span></i><span style="">, </span><i>supra</i>,
that there was a valid warrantless arrest and a proper warrantless search
incident thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts in <i style=""><span style="">Tangliben</span></i><span style=""> </span>were pronounced to be different from
those <i>in </i><i><span style="">People v. Aminnudin,

during on-the-spot apprehensions of drug pushers, illegal possessors of
firearms, jueteng collectors, smugglers of contraband goods, robbers, etc.

which these persons are associated."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In <i style=""><span style="">Tangliben</span></i><span style="">, </span>therefore, there was in the Court's

<p class="BODY">Two other decisions presented substantially similar
circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i style=""><span style="">Posadas</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">v</span></i><span style="">. </span><i style=""><span style="">C.A.,

<p class="BODY">In the first case, Posadas was seen to be acting suspiciously by
two members of the INP, Davao Metrodiscom, and when he was accosted by the two,
who identified themselves as police officers, he suddenly fled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was pursued, overtaken and,
notwithstanding his resistance, placed in custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <i style=""><span style="">buri</span></i><span style=""> </span>bag Posadas was then carrying was
found to contain a revolver, for which he could produce no license or authority
to possess, four rounds of live ammunition, and a tear gas grenade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was prosecuted for illegal possession of
firearms and ammunition and convicted after trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court affirmed Posadas' conviction,
holding that there was, in the premises, probable cause for a search without
warrant, i.e., the appellant was acting suspiciously and attempted to flee with
the <i style=""><span style="">buri</span></i><span style=""> </span>bag he had
with him at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court cited
with approval the ruling of the U.S. Federal Supreme Court in <i style=""><span style="">John </span>W.
</i><i style=""><span style="">Terry
v. State of Ohio</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>a 1968 case, which the Solicitor
General had invoked to justify the search.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i style=""><span style="">Maspil, et al</span></i><span style="">., </span>a
checkpoint was set up by elements of the First Narcotics Regional Unit of the
Narcotics Command at Sayangan, Atok, Benguet, to monitor, inspect and
scrutinize vehicles on the highway going towards Baguio City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was done because of a confidential
report by informers that Maspil and another person, Bagking, would be
transporting a large quantity of marijuana to Baguio City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the informers were with the
policemen manning the checkpoint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
expected, at about 2 o'clock in the early morning of November 1, 1986, a
jeepney approached the checkpoint, driven by Maspil, with Bagking as
passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The officers stopped the
vehicle and saw that on it were loaded 2 plastic sacks, a jute sack, and 3 big
round tin cans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When opened, the sacks
and cans were seen to contain what appeared to be marijuana leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen thereupon placed Maspil and
Bagking under arrest, and confiscated the leaves which, upon scientific
examination, were verified to be marijuana leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court upheld the validity of the search
thus conducted, as being incidental to a lawful warrantless arrest,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and declared that, as in <i style=""><span style="">Tangliben</span></i><span style="">, </span><i style=""><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">, </span>Maspil and Bagking had been caught <i style=""><span style="">in</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">flagrante</span></i><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">delicto</span></i><span style=""> </span>transporting
prohibited drugs at the time of their arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the Court took occasion to distinguish the case from <i style=""><span style="">Aminnudin</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>in which,
as aforestated, it appeared that the police officers were aware of Aminnudin's
identity, his projected criminal enterprise and the vessel on which he would be
arriving, and, equally as importantly, had sufficient time and opportunity to
obtain <span style="">a </span>search
warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Maspil and
Bagking, the Court found that the officers concerned had no exact description
of the vehicle the former would be using to transport marijuana, and no inkling
of the definite time of the suspects' arrival, and pointed out that a jeepney
on the road is not the same as a passenger boat on the high seas whose route
and time of arrival are more or less certain, and which ordinarily cannot
deviate from or otherwise alter its course, or select another destination.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The most recent decision treating of warrantless search and
seizure appears to be <i style=""><span style="">People v. Lo Ho Wing, etc., et al</span></i><span style="">, </span>G.R. No.
88017, decided on January 21, 1991 (per Gancayco, <i>J</i>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, an undercover or "deep
penetration" agent, Tia, managed somehow to gain acceptance into a group
of suspected drug smugglers, which included Peter Lo and Lim Ching Huat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tia accompanied Peter Lo, to Guangzhou,
China, where he saw him and other persons empty the contents of six (6) tins of
tea and replace them with white powder.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On their return to Manila with the cans of substituted "tea,"
they were met at the airport by Lim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
they were leaving the airport in separate vehicles, they were intercepted by
officers and operatives of the Narcotics Command (NARCOM), who had earlier been
tipped off by Tia, and placed under arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A search of the luggage brought in by Tia and Peter Lo, loaded on the
group's vehicles, quickly disclosed the six (6) tin cans containing fifty-six
(56) bags of white crystalline powder which, upon analysis, was identified as
metamphetamine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tia, Lo and Lim were
indicted for violation of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tia was discharged as state witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lo and Lim were subsequently convicted and
sentenced to life imprisonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of
the questions raised by them in this Court on appeal was whether the
warrantless search of their vehicles and personal effects was legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, citing <i><span style="">Manipon, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan</span></i><span style="">, </span>143 SCRA 267 (1986),<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
held legal the search of the appellants' moving vehicles and the seizure
therefrom of the dangerous drug, considering that there was intelligence
information, including clandestine reports by a planted spy actually
participating in the activity, that the appellants were bringing prohibited
drugs into the country; that the requirement of obtaining a search warrant
"borders on the impossible in the case of smuggling effected by the use of
a moving vehicle that can transport contraband from one place to another with
impunity," and "it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the
vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the
warrant must be sought."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In all five cases, <i style=""><span style="">Claudio, Tangliben, Posadas, Maspil, </span></i><span style="">and</span><i style=""> </i><i style=""><span style="">Lo Ho Wing</span></i><span style="">, facts </span>existed which were found by the Court as justifying
warantless arrests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <i style=""><span style="">Claudio</span></i><span style="">, </span>the
arresting officer had secretly ascertained that the woman he was arresting was
in fact in possession of marijuana:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
had personally seen that her bag contained not only vegetables but also a
package emitting the odor of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <i style=""><span style="">Tangliben</span></i><span style="">, </span>the person arrested and searched was acting suspiciously, and
had been positively pointed to as carrying marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in both cases, the accused were about to
board passenger buses, making it urgent for the police officers concerned to
take quick and decisive action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <i style=""><span style="">Posadas</span></i><span style="">, </span>the person
arrested and searched was acting suspiciously, too, and when accosted had
attempted to flee from the police officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in <i style=""><span style="">Maspil</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i>Lo </i><i><span style="">Ho Wing</span></i><span style="">, </span>there was
definite information of the precise identity of the persons engaged in
transporting prohibited drugs at a particular time and place.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Now,
as </span>regards the precise issue at hand, whether or not the <span style="">facts in </span>the
case at bar make out a <span style="">legitimate </span>instance of a warrantless search and seizure, there,
is, as earlier pointed out, a regrettable divergence of views among the members
of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the conclusion reached by the majority, I believe
that the appellant should be absolved on reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was in this case no confidential report
from, or positive identification by an informer; no attempt to flee; no bag or
package emitting tell- tale odors; no other reasonably persuasive indications
that Malmstedt was at the time in process of perpetrating the offense for which
he was subsequently prosecuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
when the soldiers searched Malmstedt's pouch and the bags in his possession,
they were simply "fishing" for evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It matters not that the search disclosed that
the bags contained prohibited substances, confirming their initial information
and suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The search was not made
by virtue of a warrant or as an incident of a lawful warrantless arrest, i.e.,
under circumstances sufficient to engender a reasonable belief that some crime
was being or about to be committed, or had just been committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no intelligent and intentional
waiver of the right against unreasonable searches and seizure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The search was therefore illegal, since the
law requires that there first be a lawful arrest of an individual before a
search of his body and his belongings may licitly be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The process cannot be reversed, i.e., a
search be first undertaken, and then an arrest <span style="">effected, </span>on the strength of the
evidence yielded by the search.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An
arrest made in that case would be unlawful, and the search undertaken as an
incident of such an unlawful arrest, also unlawful.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that when investigated at the headquarters of the
Narcotics Command at Camp Dangwa, La Trinidad, Malmstedt had, it is said,
willingly admitted that there were was hashish inside the "teddy
bears" in the luggage found in his possession -- an admission subsequently
confirmed by laboratory examination -- does not help the cause of the
prosecution one bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the
record even remotely suggests that Malmstedt was accorded the rights guaranteed
by the Constitution to all persons under custodial investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
He was not informed, prior to being interrogated, that he had the "right
to remain silent and to have competent and independent counsel preferably of
his own choice," and that if he could not afford the services of counsel,
he would be provided with one; not does it appear at all that he waived those
rights "in writing and in the presence of counsel." The soldiers and
the police officers simply went ahead with the investigation of Malmsted,
without counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admissions elicited
from Malmstedt under these circumstances, as the Constitution clearly states,
are "inadmissible in evidence against him."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prohibited drugs supposedly discovered in Malmstedt's bags,
having been taken in violation of the constitutional right against unreasonable
searches and seizures, are inadmissible against him "for any purpose in
any proceeding." Also pronounced as incompetent evidence against him are
the admissions supposedly made by him without his first being accorded the
constitutional rights of persons under custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such object evidence and admissions,
nothing remains of the case against Malmstedt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be conceded that, as the Trial Court points out, the
evidence presented by Malmstedt in his defense is feeble, unworthy of
credence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is beside the point; for
conformably to the familiar axiom, the State must rely on the strength of its
evidence and not on the weakness of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfortunate fact is that although the
existence of the hashish is an objective physical reality that cannot but be
conceded, there is in law no evidence to demonstrate with any degree of
persuasion, much less beyond reasonable doubt, that Malmstedt was engaged in a
criminal activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the paradox
created by the disregard of the applicable constitutional safeguards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tangible benefit is that the hashish in
question has been correctly confiscated and thus effectively withdrawn from
private use.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is here said should not by any means be taken as a
disapproval or a disparagement of the efforts of the police and military
authorities to deter and detect offenses, whether they be possession of and
traffic in prohibited drugs, or some other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those efforts obviously merit the support and commendation of the Courts
and indeed of every responsible citizen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But those efforts must take account of the basic rights granted by the
Constitution and the law to persons who may fall under suspicion of engaging in
criminal acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disregard of those rights
may not be justified by the objective of <span style="">ferreting
</span>out and punishing crime, no matter how eminently desirable attainment of
that objective might be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disregard of
those rights, <span style="">as
</span>this Court has earlier stressed, may result in the escape of the guilty,
and all because the "constable has blundered," rendering the evidence
inadmissible even if truthful or otherwise credible.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I therefore vote to reverse the Trial Court's judgment of October

As pointed out in Cruz, <i style="">op. cit.,</i><span style=""> </span>p. 142, in the U.S., "searches
without warrant may also be made of automobiles for the purpose of preventing
violations of smuggling or immigration laws, provided such searches are made at
borders or 'constructive borders' like checkpoints near the boundary lines of
the State," but "the mere mobility of these vehicles does not justify
their indiscriminate searches without warrants if made within the interior of
the territory and in the absence of probable cause (Almeida-Sanchez <i>v</i>.
U.S., 37 L. ed. 2d 596; Carroll <i>v</i>. U.S. 267 U.S. 132)."</p>

12 Phil. 439, to the effect that, "An officer making an arrest may take
from the person arrested any money or property found upon his persons which was

76 Phil. 637 to the effect that, "The most important exception to the
necessity for a search warrant is the right of search and seizure as an
incident to a lawful arrest. A lawful arrest may be made either while a crime
is being committed or after its commission. The right to search includes in
both instances that of searching the person of him who is arrested, in order to
find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by
which it was committed (Agnello <i>vs</i>. United States, 269 U.S., 20)."</p>

search warrant issued by a competent court before police authorities can effect
the seizure. But the Code requires it in the search of a dwelling house."</p>

Attention may be drawn, in this connection, to the Resolution of May 24, 1990
in G.R. No. 83988 (Valmonte <i>v</i>. de Villa, [Sept. 29, 1989], 178 SCRA 211)
where the Court cited with approval a ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court that
"Automobiles, because of their mobility, may be searched without a warrant
upon facts not justifying a warrantless search of a residence or office.
Brinegar <i>v</i>. United States, 338 US 160, 93 L Ed 1879, 69 S Ct 1302
(1949); Carroll <i>v</i>. United States, 267 US 132, 69 L Ed 543, 45 S Ct 280,
39 ALR 790 (1925). The cases so holding have, however, always insisted that the
officers conducting the search have 'reasonable or probable cause' to believe
that they will find the instrumentality of a crime or evidence pertaining to a
crime before they begin their warrantless search. ** (Dyke <i>v</i>. Taylor,
391 US 216, 20 L Ed 538, 88 S Ct 1472)."</p>
