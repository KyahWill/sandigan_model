<blockquote></blockquote>(Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 
pp. 12-23)</li></ol>
<p class="BODY">In compliance with the resolution of the Second Division of this 
Court of October 12, 1981 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 79-A) 
private respondent filed his comment on <st1:date month="11" day="13" year="1981">November 13, 1981</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 84-87).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then 
filed a reply thereto in compliance with the resolution of December 7, 1981 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 39) after which the petition was 
given due course in the resolution of February 8, 1982 and the parties were 
required to file their respective memoranda (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 43).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed his 
memorandum on <st1:date month="3" day="19" year="1982">March 19, 1982</st1:date> 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 45-59) while private respondent 
filed his memorandum on <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1982">April 15, 
1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 60-64).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thereafter, in the resolution of <st1:date month="4" day="30" year="1982">April 30, 1982</st1:date>, the case was submitted for 
decision.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 65).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">There is no dispute as to the facts of this case, as shown by the 
admission of private respondent to the extent of making an <span>agreement with 
petitioner to shoulder the expenses of the repair </span>of the damaged truck of 
the latter and the findings of the Court of Appeals that petitioner's evidence 
fully supports the findings of facts of the trial court as well as its judgment 
under appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">Neither does private respondent deny receipt of the summons in 
question.<span>&nbsp; </span>The bone of contention appears to be in the manner of 
service of said summons on the wife of private respondent at their dwelling 
instead of on private respondent himself personally.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends in favor of validity of such service while 
private respondent maintains the opposite view which was sustained by respondent 
Court of Appeals to the effect that the Sheriff resorted to substituted service 
under Section 8, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, without first complying with the 
mode of personal service required under Section 7 of the same Rule.</p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, the principal issue which arises in this case which involves 
an inquiry into procedural due <span class="GramE">process,</span> is whether or 
not the question of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant can be raised 
for the first time on appeal.</p>
<p class="BODY">The question has been answered in the negative by the Supreme 
Court in a long line of decisions.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, one of the 
circumstances considered by the Court as indicative of waiver by the 
defendant-appellant of any alleged defect of jurisdiction over his person 
arising from defective or even want of process, is his failure to raise the 
question of jurisdiction in the Court of First Instance and at the first 
opportunity.<span>&nbsp; </span>It has been held that upon general principles, 
defects in jurisdiction arising from irregularities in the commencement of the 
proceedings, defective process or even absence of process may be waived by a 
failure to make seasonable objections.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>Castro v. Cebu 
Portland Cement Co.</em>, 71 Phil. 481 [1941] citing <span class="SpellE"><em>Machan</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> v. De la 
Trinidad</span><span>, 3 Phil. 684; <span class="SpellE"><em>Vergara</em></span><em> v. Laciapag</em>, 28 Phil. 439; 
<em>U.S. v. Inductivo</em>, 40 Phil. 84; <span class="SpellE"><em>Soriano</em></span><em> v. Ramirez</em>, 44 Phil. 519).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>More recently, in reiteration of the same principle, the Court ruled in 
<span class="SpellE">Dalman</span> v, City Court of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City, Branch II, that as to the dismissal of the 
criminal case, the question </span>of <span>jurisdiction which was never raised 
in said case before the trial court cannot be done at this stage and level (134 
SCRA </span><span>244 [1985]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Coming </span><span>to the case at bar, it has been pointed 
out that during the stages of the proceedings in the court below, 
defendant-appellant could have questioned the jurisdiction of the lower court 
but he did not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It can of course be argued that the failure to question the lower 
court's jurisdiction cannot be accounted against <span class="SpellE">Chu</span> 
for his having been declared in default gave him no chance to participate in the 
court deliberations and therefore no chance to raise the jurisdictional issue, 
but then, he could have done so, in the subsequent pleadings he filed.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Besides, even assuming that such failure cannot be taken against him, the 
fact is he had VOLUNTARILY submitted himself to the court's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="BODY">On the contrary, private respondent voluntarily appeared thru 
counsel in the trial court.<span>&nbsp; </span>He filed a Notice of Appeal, Appeal 
Bond, <span class="GramE">Motion</span> for Extension of Time to File Record on 
Appeal, Record on Appeal, Motion for Withdrawal of Appearance, Notice of 
Appearance and Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Appeal and for 
Issuance of a Writ of Execution.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not only did he submit pleadings 
and motions, but he likewise appeared in person, thru counsel in the hearing 
held on <st1:date month="5" day="14" year="1979">May 14, 1979</st1:date> at 
<st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30 a.m.</st1:time> and orally argued in open 
court on the pending incident.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 53-54).</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Under Section 23, Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, the 
defendant's voluntary appearance in the action shall be equivalent to 
service.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, under this principle, it has been consistently held 
</span>by the Supreme Court that the defect of summons is cured by the 
<span>voluntary </span>appearance of the defendant.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Infante</em></span><em> v. Toledo</em> and 
<span class="SpellE">Lanting</span>; <span>44 Phil. 834 [<span>1918]; <span class="SpellE"><em>Aguilos</em></span><em> v. </em></span></span><span class="SpellE"><em>Sepulvede</em></span>, 53 <span>SCRA 274 [1973]; <em>J. 
M.</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Tuazon</em></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">&amp; Co. v. Estabillo</span><span><span>, 62 SCRA 1; 
</span></span><em>Castro v. Cebu Portland Cement Co.,</em> 
<em>supra</em><span>).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The Court <span>of Appeals </span>is however of the view that from 
all the actions <span>and </span>steps taken by the appellant no presumption can 
arise that he voluntarily <span>submitted </span>himself to the jurisdiction of 
the Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact according to said Court, all of these actions 
taken by the appellant are geared and mustered towards contesting the court's 
jurisdiction over his person, or of attacking the validity of the judgment 
<span>on </span>jurisdictional grounds.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Decision, CA, G.R. No. 65287-R; <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 31).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">It will be noted however, that the Notice of Appeal (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 38) unmistakably indicates the reason for 
the appeal, which reads:</p>
<blockquote><span>"2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That, </span>the herein defendant is not 
contented with the aforesaid Decision <span>for </span>it is contrary to the 
evidence and the law and the award<span> of damages </span>is so 
<span>excessively </span>unsupported by any evidence to warrant the <span>same; 
</span>hence, he is appealing said Decision <span>to </span>the Hon. Court of 
<span>Appeals, </span>Manila, both <span>on questions </span>of facts and 
law."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">As <span>clearly shown in </span>the foregoing, the above-stated 
conclusion of the Court of Appeals has evidently no basis.</p>
<p class="BODY">Of equal importance is the question:<span>&nbsp; </span>if the 
defendant in the Regional <span>Trial Court </span>(RTC) <span>has </span>been 
declared in default, may he appeal the default judgment that may subsequently be 
<span>rendered even if </span>he has <em>not</em> asked the RTC to set aside the 
declaration of default?<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer is in the 
<em>affirmative</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>However a distinction must be made as to the 
effects of such appeal:</p>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>(a) </span></span>If an 
appeal is made <em>without</em> first asking <span>the </span>RTC to set aside 
the declaration of default, and the appellate court sets aside <span>on 
</span>said declaration, all he can get is a review of the <span class="SpellE">RTC's</span> default judgment <em>without</em> the opportunity of 
having the higher court consider defense evidence (for the simple reason that no 
evidence was even adduced by him in the RTC) (See Rule 41, sec. 2, par. 3, Rules 
of Court).</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span>(b) </span></span>If upon the other hand, the 
defendant first asks the RTC to set aside the declaration of default (See Rule 
18, <span class="SpellE">secs</span>. 2 and 3, Rules of Court), and he is able to 
prevail, the declaration will be set aside, and he will now have the opportunity 
to present his evidence in the RTC.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, even if he finally loses 
in the <span class="SpellE">RTC's</span> subsequent decision, his defense can be 
considered, when appeal is made to the appellate tribunal.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of 
course, even if the default declaration is <em>not </em>set aside despite his 
motion for the setting aside, he will be entitled to all notices in the court 
proceedings, and can file any pleading he may wish to file, including the notice 
of appeal.<span>&nbsp; </span>(See Rule 13, sec. 9, Rules of Court).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the afore-mentioned rules apply to default 
declarations in the Metropolitan Trial Courts, the Municipal Trial Courts, and 
the Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, for under Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE"><span>Bilang</span></span><span> 
</span><span>129, the said inferior courts will follow the rules in the 
RTC.<span>&nbsp; </span>Note however that in summary proceedings, there can be no 
default declarations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no question that summons was timely 
issued and received by private respondent.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, he <span>never 
</span>denied actual receipt of such summons but confined himself to the 
argument that the Sheriff should prove that personal service was first made 
before resorting to substituted service.</p>
<p class="BODY">This brings to the fore the question of procedural due 
process.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE"><em>Montalban</em></span><em> v. Maximo</em> (22 SCRA 1077 [1968] 
the Court ruled that "The constitutional requirement of due process exacts that 
the service be such as may be reasonably expected to give the notice 
desired.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Once the service provided by the rules reasonably 
accomplishes that end, the requirement of justice is answered; the traditional 
notions of fair play are satisfied; due process is served."</p>
<p class="BODY">Indeed, such construction is but fair, and in accord with 
substantial justice.<span>&nbsp; </span>The burden on a plaintiff is not to be 
enlarged with a restrictive construction desired by the defendant.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">(<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 1078).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Finally in a last ditch effort, private respondent insists that 
<span>there </span>was no valid service of summons because private respondent is 
a partner and general manager in San Pedro Sawmill.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently 
the wife of private respondent to whom summons and complaint were allegedly 
served not being partnership, cannot receive the same under Section 13 of Rule 
14 of the Rules of Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">It has however been settled that actions must be brought by the 
real parties in interest and against the persons who are bound by the judgment 
obtained therein.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Salmon and Pacific 
Commercial Company v. Tan Cueco</em>, 36 Phil. 557-558 [1917]).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The title of the case both in the trial court, in the Court of 
Appeals and <span>in </span>this Court shows that the partnership is not a 
party.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, as previously stated private respondent 
himself assumed the responsibility of the accident and is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to disclaim the liabilities pertaining thereto.</p>
<p class="BODY">From what has been discussed the following conclusions are hereby 
made:<span>&nbsp; </span>jurisdiction was properly acquired by the trial court 
<span>over the person of respondent thru both service of summons and voluntary 
appearance in court; he was therefore properly declared in default for not 
having filed any answer; despite respondent's failure to file a motion to set 
aside the declaration of default, he has the right to appeal the default 
judgment but in the appeal only the evidence of the petitioner may be 
considered, respondent not having adduced any defense evidence; We agree with 
the findings of fact by the trial court, the same being <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed decision and resolution of the 
Court of Appeals are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the decision of the then Court
