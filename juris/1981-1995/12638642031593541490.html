<span class="SpellE">Somera</span> was charged with Murder in Criminal Case No.
572-K before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Branch XXIV, in <span class="GramE">an information</span> which reads:</p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 12th day of November, 1979, in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, Philippines and within
the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>, with treachery and evident premeditation and with
intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously assault, attack and strike with a knife (<span class="SpellE">Balisong</span>) one Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
alias <span class="SpellE">Orling</span>, thereby inflicting upon the latter,
wounds at his head and back, which wound (sic) necessarily produced the death
of said Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Orling</span>
shortly thereafter.</blockquote>

recidivism, the accused having been previously convicted of the crime of
homicide in Criminal Case No. 191-K on July 24, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 3.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When arraigned on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="3">March
 13, 1980</st1:date>, the accused pleaded "not guilty".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the lower court found the
accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentenced him
to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads as follows:</p>

reasonable doubt of the crime of murder, as defined in, and penalized by, Art.</span>
248 of the Revised Penal Code, and with the qualifying and generic aggravating
circumstances heretofore mentioned, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the
penalty of DEATH in the manner provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The real issue of the case at bar is whether or not the guilt of
the accused had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence consisted of the autopsy report, the <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat belonging to the deceased, the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
knife used by the assailant and the oral testimonies of the following
witnesses:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Somera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, and Dr. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented the accused himself, as
well as his wife Leonora and his brother Pedro <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the testimonies of its witnesses, the prosecution presents
the following version of the facts:</p>

<blockquote>In the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1979</st1:date>, between the hours of <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time>

<span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> were seated on bamboo benches on the western side
of the store of one Virgie <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span> at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ilocos</span></span>

</span>The house where the deceased Villegas laid (sic) in state, which was
about 8 meters away from the store, was lighted with two <span class="SpellE">optimus</span>
lamps, one inside the house and the other outside north of the house . . . (pp.
2-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., September 26, 1980; pp. 2-4, 6-8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., July 24, 1981).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The four persons were then conversing relative to the planting of
garlic when accused Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> suddenly appeared
from behind <span class="SpellE">Orling</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
who was wearing a <span class="SpellE">buri</span> hat, and stabbed the latter
with a <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> knife at the upper portion of his
back and on the right side of his forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After being hit in the forehead, deceased <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
turned around, stood up, walked towards the west direction and fell down face
downward, about five (5) meters away from the place where he was stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>
hurriedly left the place (pp. 4-5, 8-11, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1980</st1:date>;

house where the dead person was lying in state.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, brother of deceased Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, called for <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, wife of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Felicitas</span> saw
her husband sprawled on the ground, she cradled him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she was trying to talk with her
husband, the latter removed the knife on the left side of his face causing the
constant flow of blood.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Erning</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> was loaded in a
tricycle and was brought to the clinic of a certain Dr. <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>
where <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> expired three hours thereafter (pp.
3-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., September 26, 1980; pp. 10-13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., July 2, 1981).</blockquote>

Dr. Jaime <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>, Rural Health Physician of <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of victim Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According
to autopsy report (Exhibit "A"), Dr. <span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span>
found the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wound No. 1 - Puncture
wound of the left side of the head at the parietal region one inch above the
left ear, one-half inch long down to underlying bone and the brain.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wound No. 2 - Puncture
wound at the back along the left side of the vertebral column at the level of
the nipple, three and one-half inches deep hitting the lung and its blood
vessel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Brief for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>,
pp. 3-6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 82-85.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the accused Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>,
interposed the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
defense sought to establish that Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> was
visiting his sick brother in Carmen, Rosales, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pangasinan</span></span> at the time the murder took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The witnesses for the defense claimed that
the accused left for <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> on November 10, 1979
and returned to <span class="SpellE">Sabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> only on November
14, 1979 [TSN, July 1, 1982, p. 5; July 1, 1983, p. 3; August 19, 1983, p. 4.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant raises as error the reliance by the trial court on the
testimonies of the prosecution's two eyewitnesses, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Somera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span>, who positively identified appellant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> as the assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is appellant's contention that it was impossible for <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> to have identified
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> as the assailant of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> since the assailant came from behind the victim who
was then seated beside <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter had his back to the assailant and
did not notice anything until the victim was hit and fell, but by that time the
assailant had fled and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>
could not have identified him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the murder, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> was seated beside
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> [TSN, <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1980</st1:date>, p. 5.] Although he did not actually see how
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> inflicted the wounds, he heard a
cracking sound [TSN, <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1980</st1:date>,
p. 8] and saw Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> standing just a foot
behind Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then saw Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
stand up, walk for about five meters and suddenly fall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then that <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Somera</span> noticed the wounds sustained by the victim
(TSN, <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1980</st1:date>, p. 4.]
The witness had no difficulty in identifying Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>
because of his proximity to the victim and because the place where they were
seated had sufficient illumination coming from the lighted "<span class="SpellE">coleman</span>" or kerosene lamp hanging south of the store
and from the two <span class="SpellE">optimus</span> lamps from the house where a
dead person was lying in state [TSN, July 24, 1980, p. 6.] Also, <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> had known Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> since childhood, the latter being his brother's son
[TSN, <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1980</st1:date>, p. 6.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, witness <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> corroborated the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Somera</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the
time the killing took place, <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> was seated
beside a certain Pedro <span class="SpellE">Balois</span> and they were facing
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Somera</span> [TSN, <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1981</st1:date>, p. 6.] He saw how the accused suddenly appeared from
behind Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> and stabbed him twice [TSN, <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1981</st1:date>, p. 6.] He even
identified the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> knife used by the accused in
stabbing the victim [TSN, <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1981</st1:date>,
p.13.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In his attempt to destroy the credibility of the prosecution's
eyewitnesses, appellant claims that the bamboo wall east of the benches where
the witnesses and the victim were then seated blocked the illumination coming
from the kerosene lamp and the two <span class="SpellE">optimus</span> lamps and
therefore, because of the darkness, it was not possible for the witnesses to
identify the assailant [Appellant's Brief, p. 10.] However, while it is true
that there was a six (6) feet bamboo wall east of the benches where the group
of <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> was seated [TSN, July 25, 1980, p. 5.],
the said bamboo wall had holes through which the light could pass through [TSN,
July 25, 1980, pp. 5-6.] Both witnesses <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> testified that they were able to identify Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> because there was enough light coming through the
holes of the bamboo wall [TSN, <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="7">July
 24, 1980</st1:date>, p. 6; TSN, <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July
 2, 1981</st1:date>, pp. 8-9.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also claims that there are inconsistencies in the
statements of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> which,
when taken together, engenders such doubt that merits his acquittal
[Appellant's Brief, p. 6.] Thus, appellant points out that while <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> testified that
they were seating north of the store of Virgie <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> claimed that they were west of the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two eye witnesses were also not in
agreement as to whether the store was opened or closed at the time of the
murder [Appellant's Brief, p. 5.] Appellant claims that these inconsistencies
are significant because they relate to the positions of the witnesses and the
lighting condition of the scene of the crime which, in turn, can affect the
ability of the witnesses to make a positive identification of the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the record of the testimonies of the two eyewitnesses
shows that the inconsistencies in their statements are not fatal, as claimed by
the appellant, but refer only to minor details.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such minor discrepancies are to be expected from <span class="SpellE">uncoached</span>
witnesses [People v. <span class="SpellE">Arbois</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-36936, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 5, 1985</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 138 SCRA 24.]</span>
They do not affect the witnesses' positive identification of appellant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> as the assailant of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As repeatedly held by this Court,
discrepancies and inconsistencies in the testimonies of prosecution witnesses
which refer to minor details do not impair the probative value of their
testimonies [People v. <span class="SpellE">Agudo</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-43796, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 15, 1985</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 137 SCRA 516;

<p class="BODY">It is also worthy of note that in the instant case, no improper
motive was proven by the defense as to why the two eyewitnesses would falsely
testify against the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
Court has held that where there is no evidence to show that the witnesses for the
prosecution were actuated by improper motive, their identification of the
accused as the assailant should be given full faith and credit [People v. <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, G.R. No. 70639, June 30, 1987, 151 SCRA 592.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The well established rule on the issue of credibility of
witnesses is that the findings of the trial court which had the opportunity to
observe and gauge the demeanor and conduct of the witnesses while testifying
are accorded great weight and are not to be disturbed, unless the court
overlooked undisputed facts of substance and value which, if properly
considered, would affect the result of the case [People v. <span class="SpellE">Sinaon</span>,
G.R. No. L-15631, <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1966</st1:date>,
17 SCRA 266; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gabay</span>, G.R. No. 78269, <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1989</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the Court finds no cogent reason to depart from the
general rule. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The Court agrees with the
trial court's finding that witnesses <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Saquiton</span> were unwavering in their clear and positive
identification of the accused as the assailant of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
[RTC Decision, p. 16; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 50.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also faults the prosecution for its failure to present
Virgie <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span>, the owner of the store, as one of its
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claims that <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span> could have testified on the lighting condition of
the scene where the crime took place [Appellant's Brief, p. 11.]</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as correctly pointed out by the Solicitor General, there
was no need for the prosecution to present Virgie <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span>
as a witness [Brief for the <span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, p. 12; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 91.] The evidence on record does not show that <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span> was present when the killing took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even assuming that <span class="SpellE">Ballete</span>
was then present, no unfavorable inference can be drawn from the failure of the
prosecution to produce her as a witness because her testimony would only be
corroborative in nature [People v. Extra, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-29205, </span><st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 30, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 72 SCRA 199.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the defense of alibi put up by the appellant
to disprove that he was the assailant of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
does not merit serious consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Alibi is, at best, a weak defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To be believed, it must be supported by the most convincing evidence
[People v. Extra, <u>supra</u>; People v. <span class="SpellE">Batac</span>, G.R.
No. 54500, January 29, 1988, 119 SCRA 608.] In this case, the only evidence
presented by the defense to prove that the appellant was in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
when the crime took place are the testimonies of the accused himself and those
of his wife and brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
statements of the appellant's wife and brother are undeniably tainted with bias
for they spring from their natural desire to exculpate the accused from
criminal liability [People v. Romero, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-38786, 119
SCRA 234, </span><st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="12"><span class="GramE">December
 15, 1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; People v. <span class="SpellE">Orongan</span>,
G.R. No.</span> L-32751, <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="12">December 21,
 1988</st1:date>.] It has been held by this Court that alibi is weak where it
is established mainly by the accused himself and his immediate relatives, and
not by credible persons [People v. <span class="SpellE">Cabanit</span>, G.R. Nos.
62030-31, October 4, 1985, 139 SCRA 94.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not enough to
prove that the accused was somewhere when the crime was committed but he must
likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him to have been at
the scene of the crime [U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Oxiles</span>, 29 Phil. 587
(1915); People v. Coronado, G.R. No. 68932, October 28, 1986, 145 SCRA 250;
People v. Pineda, G.R. No. 72400, January 15, 1988, 157 SCRA 71.] In the
present case, the accused allegedly left <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, for Carmen, Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, on the morning of <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1979</st1:date> [TSN, <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1983</st1:date>, p. 15.] According to the defense witness,
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>, the travel time between Carmen,
Rosales, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> is at most five
(5) hours only by taking the Philippine Rabbit Bus [TSN, <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1983</st1:date>, pp. 6 &amp; 13.] The trial court
correctly held that it was not physically impossible for the accused to have
been at the scene of the crime on <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="11">November
 12, 1979</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">nine o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, even granting that he went to Carmen, Rosales, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pangasinan</span></span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, the alibi of the accused cannot prevail over
the clear and positive identification of the accused by the prosecution
witnesses [People v. <span class="SpellE">Riveral</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-14077, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 31, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 10 SCRA 55;

alibi should be rejected when the identity of the accused has been sufficiently
and positively established by eyewitnesses to the crime [People v. <span class="SpellE">Pelagio</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-16177, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 24, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 20 SCRA 153; People v. <span class="SpellE">Jamero</span>, G.R.

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the trial court's finding that the crime
committed is murder, qualified by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is treachery when the attack was so sudden and unexpected that the
victim was unable to defend himself, thus insuring the execution of the crime
without risk to the assailant [People v. <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
G.R. No. 66046, <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1985</st1:date>,
139 SCRA 339; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gutierez</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-39383, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="14" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 14, 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 158 SCRA 614.]</span>
The two eyewitnesses in this case were one in saying that the accused attacked
the unarmed and unsuspecting victim from behind and without any warning [TSN,
July 24, 1980, p. 8; July 2, 1981, p. 6.]</p>

<p class="BODY">While the information also alleged evident premeditation as a
qualifying circumstance, the trial court correctly found that it has not been
established by the evidence of the prosecution [RTC Decision, pp. 19-20; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 53-54.]</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the generic aggravating circumstance of recidivism, the
trial court took judicial notice of Criminal Case No. 191-K, entitled
"People of the Philippines v. Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> and
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>", wherein appellant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> and his brother Pedro were convicted by final
judgment of the crime of homicide for the killing of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, the brother of the victim in the instant case [RTC
Decision, p. 20; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 54.] The decision in the
above mentioned case was rendered by the same trial court which convicted the
appellant in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
contrary to the appellant's claim, the failure of the prosecution to formally
offer the original judgment of conviction in Criminal Case No. 191-K does not
preclude the trial court from properly appreciating recidivism against the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the case

the finality of judgment in a case that was previously pending and thereafter
decided by it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, recidivism has
been duly alleged in the information which made reference to the docket number
of the previous case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prosecution
witness <span class="SpellE">Avelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Somera</span> also
