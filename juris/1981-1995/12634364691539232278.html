				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">As between the buyer of a vessel at a prior extrajudicial foreclosure and the buyer at a subsequent auction sale, both buyers failing to register their transactions, who has a better right of dominion over the vessel?<br><br>On 9 May 1978, Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc. (SCLC), obtained a loan of P18,514,357.56 from private respondent Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). As security for the loan, SCLC mortgaged some of its properties, among which was a vessel, <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i>. Upon SCLC's failure to pay the loan, the mortgage was foreclosed. On 18 August 1982, the Clerk of Court and Provincial Sheriff Ex-Officio of Sultan Kudarat, Aurelio M. Rendon, conducted an auction sale and sold the vessel to DBP for P3,600,000.00. He thereafter issued a certificate of sale dated 18 August 1982 in favor of DBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> However, DBP did not register with the Philippine Coast Guard the mortgage; neither the foreclosure nor the auction sale.<br><br>In December 1983, DBP and Sta. Clara Housing Industries, Inc. (SCHI), entered into a Lease/Purchase Agreement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> which provided that DBP should lease some of the former properties of SCLC, including <i><i>MV Sta. Clara I</i></i>, to the latter and transfer actual ownership over these properties upon completion by the lessee of the stipulated lease/purchase payment.<br><br>On 10 July 1986, petitioner caused the levy and attachment of the same vessel, <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i>, in order to satisfy a judgment rendered by the Regional Trial Court, Br. XII, Davao City, in Civil Case No. 15970, "Tay Chun Suy v. Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc." At the time of the levy, the coastwise license of the vessel was in the name of Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc.<br><br>On the scheduled date of the execution sale, Atty. Necitas Kintanar, counsel for SCHI, verbally informed Deputy Sheriff Manases M. Reyes, Jr., who was to conduct the sale, that <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i> was no longer owned by SCLC but by DBP pursuant to a prior extrajudicial foreclosure sale. Despite such information, Sheriff Reyes, Jr., proceeded with the sale and awarded the vessel to petitioner for P317,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Meanwhile, on 23 July 1986, <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i> was again levied upon and attached by Deputy Sheriff Alfonso M. Zamora by virtue of a writ of attachment issued by the Regional Trial Court, Br. XI, Cebu City, in Civil Case No. CEB-5162, "Philippine Trigon Shipyard Shipping Corp. v. Sta. Clara Housing Industries, Inc., et al."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> On 24 July 1986, the same court issued an order appointing Philippine Trigon Shipyard Shipping Corporation as depositary of the attached vessel with authority to operate the vessel temporarily. <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i> was then taken from the port of Davao City to Cebu City.<br><br>Upon being informed of the execution sale to petitioner, DBP filed a complaint before the Regional Trial Court, Br. XVII, Davao City, for annulment of the execution sale, recovery of possession, damages and attorney's fees with prayer for restraining order and preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Petitioner moved to dismiss the complaint for alleged lack of jurisdiction, cause of action and/or legal personality to sue on the part of DBP.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 28 October 1986, the court denied the motion to dismiss but granted DBP's prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the denial but on 19 November 1986, the motion was likewise denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Forthwith, petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari and mandamus with prohibition assailing the Orders of 28 October and 19 November 1986 of the trial court. On 11 March 1987, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Petitioner appealed to this Court by way of a petition for review on certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 78383, "Tay Chun Suy vs. Development Bank of the Philippines, et al." In the resolution of 28 September 1987 (not 30 September 1987), the Third Division of this Court denied the petition for lack of merit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>On 4 December 1987, the trial court issued a decision which, among other matters, declared that DBP was the lawful owner of <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i> and that the public auction sale conducted by Deputy Sheriff Manases Reyes, Jr., on 16 July 1986 and the resultant certificate of sale were null and void.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>On 16 December 1987, petitioner sought recourse to the Court of Appeals. On 28 February 1990, the appellate court dismissed his appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On 23 May 1990, the motion to reconsider the dismissal was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Hence, this petition for review on certiorari. Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals erred (1) in finding that the sheriff's auction sale of the vessel did not enjoy the presumption of regularity; and (2) in affirming the decision of the trial court declaring DBP as the true and exclusive owner of <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>Well-entrenched is the rule that factual findings of the trial court, as well as those of the Court of Appeals, are entitled to great weight and respect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> This rule once more finds application in the case at bar.<br><br>The records show that SCHI, lessee of the vessel, is an entity separate from SCLC, and was not a party to the case filed by petitioner against the latter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Yet, SCHI was furnished, on a Saturday, copy of the notice of auction sale of <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i>. Sta. Clara Lumber Co., Inc., which was the proper party, does not appear to have been notified. Upon being informed of the auction sale, counsel for SCHI immediately went to the auction site and requested that the sale be reset that day on the ground that SCLC was no longer the owner of the vessel. To support this claim, the Manager of SCHI hurriedly left for her office to secure a copy of the certificate of sale in favor of DBP as this was demanded by the sheriff.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Given the circumstances obtaining in this case, a delay of a few hours could not have prejudiced petitioner. A sheriff's ministerial duty to conduct an auction sale is not without any limitation. In the performance of this duty, he is deemed to know what is inherently right and inherently wrong. Nonetheless, Sheriff Reyes, Jr., upon the persistent proddings of petitioner, proceeded with the auction sale. His poor judgment alone would not have caused any suspicion of bias. However, his precipitate action taken together with the anomalous proceedings that ensued, and the haste with which he delivered the certificate of sale to petitioner in the afternoon of the day of the auction sale lead to the inevitable conclusion that the whole operation was contrived to benefit petitioner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The handwritten Minutes (Exh. "D") of the auction sale clearly indicate the haste with which they were prepared, a telltale evidence of the anomalous conduct of the proceedings. On its face, one cannot determine the name of the successful bidder of the vessel.

The unexplained inconsistencies in the minutes and the certificate of sale are so material as to affect the integrity of the whole proceedings. Noteworthy, too, is the fact that the Minutes (Exh. "D") do not mention the request of counsel for SCHI for deferment of the auction sale. While the request was made prior to the auction sale, the trial court was correct in its observation that the same should have been entered in the minutes because of its importance and relevance to the sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Under these circumstances, the ruling of the appellate court sustaining the trial court on the nullity of the auction sale cannot be faulted.<br><br>Petitioner vigorously maintains that the failure of DBP to register its title to <i>MV Sta. Clara I</i> with the Philippine Coast Guard is fatal to its claim of ownership. Likewise, he raises doubts as to whether the trial court has jurisdiction to issue the writ of preliminary injunction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup><br><br>In G.R. No. 78383, we rejected these arguments in our resolution of 28 September 1987 -<br><blockquote>The respondent appellate court correctly held that the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 17, had jurisdiction over the action brought in Civil Case No. 18188 concerning the vessel herein involved which was allegedly purchased by petitioner in an execution sale, and which execution sale was the result of the judgment rendered by Branch 12 of the same Regional Trial Court in Civil Case No. 15970 Branch 17, Regional Trial Court of Davao City, did <u>not</u> undertake to annul the <u>judgment</u> of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch 12, jurisdiction to annul belonging to the Court of Appeals. Respondent appellate court also correctly held that a certificate of registration of ownership of a vessel is only presumptive evidence that the registered owner has legal title to the vessel, and that DBP's failure to register with the Philippine Coast Guard its prior acquisition of the vessel is not fatal to its ownership of said vessel, <i>vis-a-vis</i> petitioner herein, who similarly failed to register the alleged subsequent sale of the vessel to itself (sic) in an execution sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br></blockquote>This resolution is now final and executory. The question of whether the non-registration by DBP is fatal to its claim to the vessel or whether the trial court has jurisdiction over the action should no longer be raised anew. Once a case has been decided one way, then another case involving exactly the same point at issue should be decided in the same manner.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> At any rate, our ruling in Santos v. Bayhon<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> should put to rest petitioner's doubt as to the jurisdiction of the trial court -<br><blockquote>The general rule that no court has the power to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of another court with concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction possessing equal power to grant injunctive relief, <u>applies only when no third-party claimant is involved</u> (<i>Traders Royal Bank v. Intermediate Appellate Court</i>, 133 SCRA 142). <u>When a third-party, or a stranger to the action, asserts a claim over the property levied upon, the claimant may vindicate his claim by an independent action in the proper civil court which may stop the execution of the judgment on property not belonging to the judgment debtor</u> (underscoring supplied).<br></blockquote>Further, petitioner contends that he is a <u>bona fide</u> purchaser for value at the auction sale and that he came to know about the acquisition by DBP only upon its filing of the complaint for annulment of the execution sale.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>The evidence on record belies such contention.

Under the caveat emptor rule, he assumed the risk of losing the vessel because his right to it cannot be considered superior to that of DBP. As we held in one case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> an execution creditor generally acquires no higher or better right than what the execution debtor has in the property levied upon. It follows then that if the judgment debtor had no interest in the property, the execution creditor acquires no interest therein.<br><br>Moreover, petitioner is now estopped from denying knowledge of the prior claim of DBP to the vessel in the light of his judicial admission. Thus, the trial court ruled -<br><blockquote>By way of factual background, defendant Tay Chun Suy through counsel, admitted all prior proceedings pertinent to the testimony of plaintiff witness, Aurelio Rendon, in order to dispense with his testimony, Exh. "A" to "F" and submarkings for plaintiff, were admitted referring to the foreclosure sale of the subject vessel by the sheriff of Sultan Kudarat province; the certificate of sale and/or corresponding notices required by law, all matters were contained in the Order of this Court dated August 6, 1986.<br><br>In effect, defendant Tay Chun Suy, admitted the ownership of plaintiff over said vessel way back on August 18, 1982.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br></blockquote>Petitioner takes exception to the aforequoted ruling. He asserts that he never admitted that he knew of DBP's prior acquisition at the time of the execution sale on 16 July 1986.<br><br>Petitioner never challenged this particular ruling in his appeal to the Court of Appeals. Hence, he cannot be allowed to ventilate it now in this proceeding.
