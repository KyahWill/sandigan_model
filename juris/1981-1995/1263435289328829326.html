U. Alberto and Rosita U. Alberto, mother and daughter respectively, under
paragraph 5 of the aforesaid Third Amended Deed of First Mortgage substituted
Associated Construction and Surveys Corporation, Philippine Model Homes
Development Corporation, Mariano Z. Velarde and Eusebio T. Ramos, as solidary
obligors;</p>

<p class="2Q">"5.  On July 23, 1974,
after considering additional releases in the amount of P2,659,700.00, made to
defendant Moonwalk, defendant Moonwalk delivered to the plaintiff a promissory
note for TWELVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED PESOS
(P12,254,700.00) Annex 'E', signed by Eusebio T. Ramos, and the said Rosita U.

trial court issued an order dismissing the complaint on the ground that the
obligation was already extinguished by the payment by Moonwalk of its

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hence, this Petition
wherein SSS raises the following grounds for review:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>First</u>, in concluding that the penalties due from
Moonwalk are "deemed waived and/or barred," the appellate court
disregarded the basic tenet that waiver of a right must be express, made in a
clear and unequivocal manner.  There is
no evidence in the case at bar to show that SSS made a clear, positive waiver
of the penalties, made with full knowledge of the circumstances.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Second</u>, it misconstrued the ruling that SSS funds are trust
funds, and SSS, being a mere trustee, cannot perform acts affecting the same,
including condonation of penalties, that would diminish property rights of the
owners and beneficiaries thereof.  (United Christian Missionary Society v. Social Security Commission, 30
SCRA 982, 988 [1969])<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Third</u>, it ignored the fact that penalty at the rate of 12%
p.a. is not inequitable.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Fourth</u>, it ignored the principle that equity will cancel a
release on the ground of mistake of fact."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The same problem which
confronted the respondent court is presented before Us:  Is the penalty demandable even after the
extinguishment of the principal obligation?</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The former Intermediate
Appellate Court, through Justice Eduardo P. Caguioa, held in the negative.  It reasoned, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2.  As we have
explained under No. 1, contrary to what the plaintiff-appellant states in its
Brief, what is sought to be recovered in this case is not the 12% interest on
the loan but the 12% penalty for failure to pay on time the amortization.  What is sought to be enforced therefore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>the penal clause of the contract
entered into between the parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, what is a penal clause.  A penal clause has been defined as</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">"an accessory obligation which the
parties attach to a principal obligation for the purpose of insuring the
performance thereof by imposing on the debtor a special prestation (generally
consisting in the payment of a sum of money) in case the obligation is not
fulfilled or is irregularly or inadequately fulfilled" (3 Castan 8th Ed.
p. 118)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Now an accessory obligation has been
defined as that attached to a principal obligation in order to complete the
same or take its place in the case of breach (4 Puig Peña Part 1 p. 76).  Note therefore that an accessory obligation
is dependent for its existence on the existence of a principal obligation.  A principal obligation may exist without an
accessory obligation but an accessory obligation cannot exist without a
principal obligation.  For example, the
contract of mortgage is an accessory obligation to enforce the performance of
the main obligation of indebtedness.  An
indebtedness can exist without the mortgage but a mortgage cannot exist without
the indebtedness, which is the principal obligation.  In the present case, the principal obligation is the loan between
the parties.  The accessory obligation
of a penal clause is to enforce the main obligation of payment of the
loan.  If therefore the principal
obligation does not exist the penalty being accessory cannot exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now then when is the penalty demandable?  A penalty is demandable in case of non performance or late
performance of the main obligation.  In
other words in order that the penalty may arise there must be a breach of the
obligation either by total or partial non fulfillment or there is non
fulfillment in point of time which is called mora or delay.  The debtor therefore violates the obligation
in point of time if there is mora or delay.  Now, there is no mora or delay unless there is a demand.  It is noteworthy that in the present case
during all the period when the principal obligation was still subsisting,
although there were late amortizations there was no demand made by the
creditor, plaintiff-appellant for the payment of the penalty.  Therefore up to the time of the letter of
plaintiff-appellant there was no demand for the payment of the penalty, hence
the debtor was not in mora in the payment of the penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, on October 1, 1979, plaintiff?appellant issued its
statement of account (Exhibit F) showing the total obligation of Moonwalk as
P15,004,905.74, and forthwith demanded payment from defendant-appellee.  Because of the demand for payment, Moonwalk made
several payments on September 29, October 9 and 19, 1979 respectively, all in
all totalling P15,004,905.74 which was a complete payment of its obligation as
stated in Exhibit F.  Because of this
payment the obligation of Moonwalk was considered extinguished, and pursuant to
said extinguishment, the real estate mortgages given by Moonwalk were released
on October 9, 1979 and October 10, 1979 (Exhibits G and H).  For all purposes therefore the principal
obligation of defendant-appellee was deemed extinguished as well as the
accessory obligation of real estate mortgage; and that is the reason for the
release of all the Real Estate Mortgages on October 9 and 10, 1979
respectively.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, besides the Real Estate Mortgages, the penal clause which is
also an accessory obligation, must also be deemed extinguished considering that
the principal obligation was considered extinguished, and the penal clause
being an accessory obligation cannot exist without a principal obligation.  That being the case, the demand for payment
of the penal clause made by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">plaintiff-appellant
</span>in its demand letter dated November 28, 1979 and its follow up letter
dated December 17, 1979 (which parenthetically are the only demands for payment
of the penalties) are therefore ineffective as there was nothing to
demand.  It would be otherwise, if the
demand for the payment of the penalty was made prior to the extinguishment of
the obligation because then the obligation of Moonwalk <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">would </span>consist of:  1) the
principal obligation 2) the interest of 12% on the principal obligation and 3)
the penalty of 12% for late payment for after demand, Moonwalk would be in mora
and therefore liable for the penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let it be emphasized that at the time of the demand made in the
letters of November 28, 1979 and December 17, 1979 as far as the penalty is
concerned, the defendant-appellee was not in default since there was no mora
prior to the demand.  That being the
case, therefore, the demand made after the extinguishment of the principal obligation
which carried with it the extinguishment of the penal clause being merely an
accessory obligation, was an exercise in futility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  At the time of the
payment made of the full obligation on October 10, 1979 together with the 12%
interest by defendant-appellee Moonwalk; its obligation was extinguished.  It being extinguished, there was no more
need for the penal clause.  Now, it is
to be noted that penalty at anytime can be modified by the Court.  Even substantial performance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">u</span>nder Art. 1234 authorizes the Court
to consider it as complete performance minus damages.  Now, Art. 1229 Civil Code of the Philippines provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"ART. 1229.  The judge
shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obligation has been
partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor.  Even if there has been no performance, the penalty may also be
reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable.”</p>

<blockquote>If the penalty can be reduced after the principal obligation has
been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor, which is nonetheless a
breach of the obligation, with more reason the penal clause is not demandable
when full obligation has been complied with since in that case there is no
breach of the obligation.  In the
present case, there has been as yet no demand for payment of the penalty at the
time of the extinguishment of the obligation, hence there was likewise an
extinguishment of the penalty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let Us emphasize that the obligation of defendant-appellee was
fully complied with by the debtor, that is, the amount loaned together with the
12% interest has been fully paid by the appellee.  That being so, there is no basis for demanding the penal clause
since he obligation has been extinguished.  Here there has been a waiver of the penal clause as it was not demanded
before the full obligation was fully paid and extinguished.  Again, emphasis must be made on the fact
that plaintiff-appellant has not lost anything under the contract since it got
back in full the amount loan (sic) as well as the interest thereof.  The same thing would have happened if the
obligation was paid on time, for then the penal clause, under the terms of the
contract would not apply.  Payment of
the penalty does not mean gain or loss of plaintiff-appellant since it is
merely for the purpose of enforcing the performance of the main
obligation.  Since the obligation has
been fully complied with and extinguished, the penal clause has lost its raison
d' entre."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

</span>executed by Moonwalk in favor of SSS.  But this foreclosure did not push through upon Moonwalk's requests and
promises to pay in full.  The next
demand for payment happened on October 1, 1979 when SSS issued a Statement of
Account to Moonwalk.  And in accordance
with said statement, Moonwalk <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">paid its
loan in full.  What is clear, therefore,
is that </span>Moonwalk was never in default because SSS never compelled
performance.  Though it tried to
foreclose the mortgages, SSS itself desisted from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">doing </span>so upon the entreaties of Moonwalk.  If the Statement of Account could properly
be considered as demand for payment, the demand was complied with on time.  Hence, no delay occurred and there was,
therefore, no occasion when the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">p</span>e<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">nalty </span>became demandable and
enforceable.  Since there was no default
in the performance of the main obligation -- payment of the loan -- SSS was
never entitled to recover any penalty, not at the time it made the Statement of
Account and certainly, not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">after the
extinguishment of the principal obligation because then, all the more that SSS
had no reason to ask for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">penalties.  Thus, there could never be any occasion for waiver or even mistake in
the application for payment because there was nothing for SSS to waive as its
right to enforce the penalty did not arise.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">SSS, however, in buttressing
its claim that it never waived the penalties, argued that the funds it held
were trust funds and as trustee, the petitioner could not perform acts
affecting the funds that would diminish property rights of the owners and
beneficiaries thereof.  To support its
claim, SSS cited the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of <u>United Christian Missionary Society v.
Social Security Commission</u>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We looked into the case
and found out that it is not applicable to the present case as it dealt not
with the right of the SSS to collect penalties which were provided for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">contracts which it entered into but with its right to collect premiums
and its duty to collect the penalty for delayed payment or non-payment of
premiums.  The Supreme Court, in that
case, stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"No discretion or alternative is granted respondent Commission
in the enforcement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the law's
mandate that the employer who fails to comply with his legal obligation to
remit the premiums to the System within the prescribed period shall pay a penalty
of three (3%) per month.  The prescribed
penalty is evidently of a punitive character, provided by the legislature to
assure that employers do not take lightly the State's exercise of the police
power in the implementation of the Republic's declared policy "to develop,
establish gradually and perfect a social security system which shall be
suitable to the needs of the people throughout the Philippines and (to) provide
protection to employers against the hazards of disability, sickness, old age and
death.  x x x.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thus, We agree with the
decision of the respondent Court on the matter which We quote, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Note that the above case refers to the condonation of the
penalty for the non remittance of the premium which is provided for by Section
22(a) of the Social Security Act x x x.  In other words, what was sought to be condoned was the penalty provided
for by law for non remittance of premium for coverage under the Social Security
Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The case at bar does not refer to any penalty provided for by law
nor does it refer to the non remittance of premium.  The case at bar refers to a contract of loan entered into between
plaintiff and defendant Moonwalk Development and Housing Corporation.  Note, therefore, that no provision of law is
involved in this case, nor is there any penalty imposed by law nor a case about
non?remittance of premium required by law.  The present case refers to a contract of loan payable in
installments not provided for by law but by agreement of the parties.  Therefore, the ratio decidendi of the case
of United Christian Missionary Society vs. Social Security Commission which
plaintiff-appellant relies is not applicable in this case; clearly, the Social
Security Commission, which is a creature of the Social Security Act cannot
condone a mandatory provision of law providing for the payment of premiums and
for penalties for non remittance.  The
life of the Social Security Act is in the premiums because these are the funds
from which the Social Security Act gets the money for its purposes and the non-­remittance
of the premiums is penalized not by the Social Security Commission but by law.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is admitted that when a government created corporation enters
into a contract with private party concerning a loan, it descends to the level
of a private person.  Hence, the rules
on contract applicable to private parties are applicable to it.  The argument therefore that the Social
Security Commission cannot waive or condone the penalties which was applied in
the United Christian Missionary Society cannot apply this case.  First, because what was not paid were
installments on a loan but premiums required by law to be paid by the parties
covered by the Social Security Act.  Secondly, what is sought to be condoned or waived are penalties <u>not
imposed by law</u> for failure to remit premiums <u>required by law</u>, but a
penalty for non payment provided for by the agreement of the parties in the
contract between them.  x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
