</p><p>
COME NOW the parties, assisted by their respective counsel, and to this 
Honorable Court respectfully submit the following Compromise Agreement 
for its approval:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.      Petitioner hereby agrees to dismiss the present petition 
and to desist from filing any unfair labor practice cage or any other 
labor, administrative, civil or criminal case of any kind whatsoever 
against Respondents, arising out of her employment with Respondent 
Philippine Airlines, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "PAL"), in 
consideration of Respondents' agreement to make certain payments and 
grant certain benefits, as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        (a)      Respondent shall pay to Petitioner within 10 days from 
approval of this compromise agreement, separation pay equivalent to one 
(1) month's pay for each year of Petitioner's 17.5 years of service with
 Respondent PAL.  Petitioner shall thereafter be deemed retired 
effective December 31, 1983 by reason of redundancy of her position as 
Director-Industry Affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
        (b)      In addition, Petitioner shall be paid the cash 
equivalent of unused vacation leave, which the parties agree totals 22 
days;
    </p>
    <p>
        (c)      Petitioner and her husband shall each be granted FIVE 
(5) trip passes for international trips and FIVE (5) trip passes for 
domestic <em>or</em> regional trips, while her two sons shall each be 
entitled to TWO (2) sets of trip passes, each for international and 
domestic or regional.  Such trip passes must be ticketed and all trips 
actually undertaken within a period of 10 years commencing January 1, 
1984.  In addition, petitioner and her aforementioned family members 
shall also each be allowed respectively to travel under the reduced 
rates of 50% under a PSQ F/Business Class/Y 6-2 category within a period
 of ten (10) years from January 1, 1984 and under the reduced rates of 
25% under the same category within a period of fifteen (15) years 
thereafter.  All passes obtained by Petitioner, her husband and two sons
 in accordance herewith shall carry PSQ F/Y category and shall be 
entitled to all privileges, but subject to such limitations, appurtenant
 to such category under applicable company rules and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
        (d)      Petitioner shall also be entitled to such medical and 
dental benefits normally available to an incumbent employee of 
Petitioner's rank for a period of one year from January 1, 1984.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    2.      Petitioner hereby agrees to accept the foregoing payments 
and benefits in full and final settlement of all claims against 
Respondent PAL for amounts due or benefits and privileges arising from 
or in any way connected with Petitioner's employment with Respondent 
PAL.  In consideration thereof, Petitioner irrevocably consents to be 
deemed retired from Respondent PAL effective December 31, 1983.  As an 
integral part of this compromise agreement, Petitioner warrants and 
covenants that no unfair labor practice or any other labor, 
administrative, civil or criminal suit arising out of or in any way 
predicated upon Petitioner's employment with Respondent PAL shall be 
filed by her or in her behalf or by anyone asserting any right derived 
from Petitioner.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.      The parties agree to mutually waive, as they hereby waive in
 favor of each other and in favor of Respondent PAL's directors, 
officers or employees any and all rights of action accruing to and 
against each other on account of Petitioner's employment with Respondent
 PAL.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.      This Compromise Agreement shall be without prejudice to the 
future re-employment of Petitioner by Respondent PAL under mutually 
acceptable terms and conditions.  It is understood that in any future 
re-employment, Petitioner shall be considered a new employee, subject to
 all pertinent company regulations applicable to new employees, such as 
but not limited to entrance requirements and new employees' benefits.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that the foregoing Compromise 
Agreement not being contrary to law, morals and public (sic) be approved
 and that judgment be rendered in accordance therewith.
