<p class="BODY">On November 28, 1966, petitioners-spouses <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>

Angeles-Fernandez and the latter's husband <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
Fernandez purchased in common a <span style="">parcel

Subdivision, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parcel of land was purchased for P15<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Spouses <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> Fernandez
advanced the <span class="SpellE">downpayment</span> of P5<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1967</st1:date>, the<span style=""> </span>vendors Torres executed a Deed of

that the Absolute Deed of Sale did not include their names as vendees they

Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1967</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> Fernandez executed an affidavit

and <span class="SpellE">Vivencia</span> Fernandez of a portion of the <span style="">subject parcel of land consisting of 110
square meters and </span><span style="">the receipt </span><span style="">of the consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
in the </span>amount of P5<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When private respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Angeles-Fernandez planned to build a house on the lot, she was informed by t<span style="">h</span>e City Engineer <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City that the area in <span class="SpellE">Pag-asa</span> is classified under the
zoning ordinance as RÂ­-2 or residential 2, wherein the minimum requirement for
a family house is 240 square meters and <span style="">t</span>herefore,
no <span style="">two </span>(2) separate and
independent family houses can be built on the 310 square meter lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also found out <span style="">that the </span><span style="">Register of </span><span style="">Deeds will not issue a separate </span>title
for only 110 square meters (p. 4, C.A. Decision; p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, <span style="">a </span>duplex

<p class="BODY">After trial, a decision (pp. 43-45, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">) </span>was <span style="">rendered on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="7"><span style="">July 23,

should be taken against her for as ruled by the higher court; âa man's acts,

presume that they correspond with the truth, and it is his fault if they do
not.â (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> vs.

the total amount of P15,500.00 mentioned in the Deed of Conditional Sale dated
November 28, 1966 (Exhibit 'B' &amp; Exhibit '2'), was merely <span style="">a </span>loan, and that she and her husband <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> E. Fernandez have already paid the same almost
three-fold to plaintiffs, cannot be considered there being no concrete proof on
record to substantiate the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court noted, however, that no further amount, aside from the P5<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> were paid by the plaintiffs for the purchase of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
13, Block N-19 of <span class="SpellE">Pagasa</span> Subdivision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By mathematical computations, said amount was

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the trial court's decision and the order

</span>In a decision (pp. 33-40, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">)</span><span style=""> </span>promulgated on <st1:date year="1988" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1988</st1:date>, respondent appellate court made
a different conclusion and modified the decision of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"The main basis of the trial court in concluding that the plaintiffs
are entitled to 1/2 and later to 1/3 portion of the lot and house in <span class="SpellE">Pag-asa</span> are the deed of conditional sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B and <span style="">2) </span>and
the affidavit executed by <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> Fernandez (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It appears, however, that the <span class="GramE">effect of
said documents have</span> been modified by later events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first is the absolute deed of sale of the
house and lot in question and the subsequent issuance of the title thereof only
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> Fernandez and his wife (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C and 3 and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">A and 1).</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Transfer Certificate of Title No. 149347 in the name of the
spouses <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> E. Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> A. Fernandez was issued <span style="">by </span>the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City

</span>If</span>, indeed, the herein plaintiffs were entitled to 1/2 of the
said property, they should have taken steps to include their names in the said
title or at least had it annotated on said title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Certificate of Title issued a party
accumulates all the ultimate facts with respect to a particular piece of
registered land in one single document, making out a precise and correct
statement to the exact status of the fee simple title which the owner has in
fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once issued, the certificate is
the evidence of the title which the owner has (<span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Saleeby</span>, 31 Phil. 590).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">torrens</span></span> title concludes all
controversy over ownership of land covered by final decree of registration, and
title by adverse possession cannot be acquired against the registered owner
(Sec. 46, Act 496; J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span> and Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Vibat</span>, L-28884, May 29, 1963, 8 SCRA 54; <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, CA 51612-R,
Feb. 14, 1979).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What militates more against the claim of ownership of a
portion of the property in question by the plaintiffs is the fact that as a
result of marriage settlement between <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
Fernandez and his wife <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, the whole property
was adjudicated to <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The settlement was approved by the Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein
plaintiffs were supposed to know about said marriage settlement of property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here is a situation where <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
was in fact abandoned by her husband <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>, who
is a nephew of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs should have intervened in said
case by filing their claims on the property that was to be granted to <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> alone in the marriage settlement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would be less than fair for the
herein plaintiffs to demand their alleged share against <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
alone after their nephew agreed to grant said property to his wife whom he
abandoned.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, the cause of action of the plaintiffs had already
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already stated, the
Transfer Certificate of Title was issued in the name of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez
in 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From said date, <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and his <span style="">w</span>ife
exercised acts of absolute ownership by mortgaging the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant action to claim ownership of the
portion of the land was filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With these findings, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no
merit in the contention of plaintiffs-appellants that they are entitled to
damages and attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED by
declaring the defendant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez as the sole
owner of the property in question covered by Transfer <span style="">Certificate </span>of Title No. 14934, Registry <span style="">of </span>Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In fairness <span style="">to </span>the
plaintiffs, however, defendant <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez is

<p class="BODY">While, as a rule, this Court is bound by the findings of the
Court of Appeals in matters of fact, that rule is subject to well-settled
exceptions, amongst them:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) <span style="">when </span>the same are grounded entirely <span style="">on speculation, surmise, and conjecture; (2)
the inference made is manifestly mistaken; (3) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; (4) its judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;

v. Court of Appeals,<span style=""> L-31471, November
12, 1987).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, there is a disparity in the factual findings
and conclusions of the respondent appellate court and the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the evidence presented and in
view of the accepted rule <span style="">that
"the judge who tries a case in the court below, has vastly superior
advantage for the ascertainment of truth and the detection of falsehood over an
appellate court of review (<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Buan</span>, L-22459, October 31, 1967, 21 SCRA 642), the findings
of the trial court must be upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with petitioners' contention that respondent court erred
in not declaring them as <span style="">part </span>owners
of the subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
sufficient evidence o<span style="">n </span>record to
prove that petitioners and spouses <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez purchased <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">common</span></u> the lot subject of this case
and that it was the partiesâ intention to become owners of specific portions
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purchase of the property by the two Fernandez couples was
evidenced by a Deed of Conditional Sale (Exhibit "B" and Exhibit
"2") executed by the previous owners Spouses Santos and <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span> de Torres in favor of the petitioners and the
Spouses <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent appellate court
concluded that the effect of the Deed of Conditional Sale was modified by later
events specifically, the execution of a <span style="">deed
</span>of Absolute Sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
Fernandez and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez <span style="">only.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, respondent appellate court lost sight of the fact that upon
petitioners' knowledge that the Deed </span>of Absolute Sale was executed in
favor of <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
Fernandez only, the petitioners confronted the latter spouses which led to the
execution by the latter on April 24, 1967 of an affidavit (Exhibit 'D') a<span style="">cknowledging petitioners' purchase of 110
square meters of the subject lot and the receipt of the consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> for P5<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The due execution and authenticity of both
the Deed of Conditional Sale and Affidavit were never denied by private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having recognized the sale
and the receipt of the consideration in the affidavit, private respondent is
now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from going against such declaration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is noted that subsequent to the execution of the affidavit, a duplex
house was constructed on the lot where one unit was occupied by private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and her husband <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and the other unit by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The expenses for the construction of the
duplex were advanced by the spouses <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>, but they demanded reimbursement of the expenses
they advanced for the portion belonging to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "I" and Exhibit
"J" reveal that on <span style="">November
10, 1969, <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> demanded from the petitioners
payment </span>of <span style="">their share of the
materials used in the construction of their portion of the duplex house
amounting to P2,607.70 (p. 44, </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">) </span><span style="">and the taxes due from them for the house and lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On</span> <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="3"><span style="">March 8, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioners paid for their share of the
realty taxes for the year 1974, 1975, 1976 and 1977 in the total amount of
P894.36 to private respondent </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> (Exhibit
"H").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the expenses in the <span style="">construction of the portion of the duplex
possessed by petitioners, they gave P1<span class="GramE">,258.10</span> to <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> who </span>issued a receipt <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
(Exhibit âKâ and "K-1").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners promised to liquidate the balance in <span style="">installment at the rate of P300.00 a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court concluded that the amount of
P1<span class="GramE">,258.10</span> advanced by petitioners was not sufficient
to construct their portion of the duplex house and that no evidence was
presented to prove that petitioners paid for the balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <span class="GramE">this findings</span>,
it erroneously concluded that the entire duplex house belongs to private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Angeles-Fernandez.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
Fernandez admitted in Exhibits "I" and "J" petitioner's
ownership of the portion of the duplex house now occupied by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be that the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,258.10</span> paid by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
Fernandez to <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> Fernandez was not sufficient
to construct their portion of the duplex house but such insufficiency cannot be
made the basis for divesting them of their ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court's conclusion that petitioners were not part
owners of subject land relied much on the existence of Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 149347 issued in the name of Spouses <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further concluded that if, indeed,
petitioners were entitled to 1/2 of the property, <span class="GramE">they</span>
should have taken steps to include their names in the title.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 50 of Act No. 496 (now Sec. 51 of P.D. 1529), provides
that the registration of the deed is the operative act to bind or affect the
land insofar as third persons are concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But where the party has knowledge of a prior existing interest which is
u<span style="">nregistered at the time he acquired a
right to the same land, his knowledge of that prior unregistered interest has
the effect of registration as to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="">torrens</span></span></span><span style=""> system cannot be </span><span style="">used </span><span style="">as a shield for the commission of fraud (<span class="SpellE">Gustillo</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Maravilla</span>, 48 Phil. 442).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As far as private respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Angeles and her husband <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span>
are concerned, the non-registration of the affidavit admitting their sale of a
portion of 110 square meters of the subject land to petitioners cannot be
invoked as </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">defense because (K)<span class="SpellE">nowledge</span>
of an unregistered sale is equivalent to registration (<span class="SpellE">Winkleman</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Veluz</span>, 43 Phil. 604).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent appellate court also erred in ruling that the
cause of action of petitioners had already prescribed in view of the issuance <span style="">in </span>1970 of a certificate of title in
the name of the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As already stated, <span style="">the issuance
of a certificate of title </span><span style="">in</span><span style=""> the name appearing therein does not preclude
petitioners from asserting their right of ownership over the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and again it has been ruled that the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">torrens</span></span> system should not be used
as a shield to protect fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
prescription cannot be considered against petitioners who had been in
possession of subject premises from the time it was purchased from the de
Torres spouses in 1967 and continue to possess the same under claim of
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no sufficient basis
for the respondent court to conclude that spouses <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Justiniano</span> <span class="GramE">were possessing</span>
the entire property adversely against petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, the first time that respondent <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> Fernandez claimed adverse possession of the entire
premises was when she demanded from petitioners the possession of the unit
possessed by them in a letter dated October </span>22, 1<span style="">977 (Exhibit "F"), emboldened by a decision of the Juvenile
and Domestic Relations Court awarding the premises to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of private respondent to </span><span style="">claim </span><span style="">total ownership of the premises was in fact, pursued only
half-heartedly by her because the second time that she demanded possession of
the premises was four (4) years after or on June 21, 1981, after an action to
quiet title was filed by petitioners on June 9, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Almanza</span> v.
Arguelles, L-49250 </span><st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="12"><span style="">December </span>21, <span style="">1987</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="GramE">We</span> held that, "prescription cannot be invoked in an action
