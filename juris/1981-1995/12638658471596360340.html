<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE STATEMENT</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">I agree with the
conclusion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the Court that there is no need to go into
the issue of whether or not certain "statistically improbable"
results should be nullified if any such nullification will not materially
affect the overall election results.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
would be engaging in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">academic exercise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">However, I would like to
go on record that I found it difficult to concur in this case because there are
indeed glaring anomalies in the conduct of the regional </span>elections for
the autonomous government of Muslim Mindanao.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Inspite of the 24 year old doctrine in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Lagumbay</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>v.</u> <u>COMELEC</u>
(16 SCRA 175 [1966]), there is exactly the same massive defiance </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">law which initially </span>led to the statistical improbability
ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">election anomalies are committed in such a crude and flaunting manner
as to insult the intelligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is disturbing when case after case comes to this Court
presenting unbelievable election returns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this petition, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">instance, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nine (9) towns of
Sulu, candidates Candao and Loong received exactly the same number of votes in
each of 197 precints for a total of 65,402 votes each while candidates Dimaporo
and Ututalum each received </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">zero</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">votes
in all 197 precincts of those nine (9) municipalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Lagumbay</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">if the watchers of
Dimaporo and Ututalum betrayed their party, the voting and counting of ballots
in each precinct was a sham and a mockery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is reported that in some precincts, the Board of Inspectors never
reported for work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">How </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">could the elections be conducted and the returns prepared if there were
no boards of inspectors?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In some cases,
more than the number of registered voters cast their ballots or only one person
prepared all the ballots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the
returns appear genuine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC suggests an expansion of the parameters of
statistical improbability to avoid obviously <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">manufactured, spurious, unnatural, and unbelievable returns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem is, as stated in </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Pacis</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">COMELEC</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(25 SCRA 377 [1968]), electoral frauds are
diverse and beyond anticipation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
COMELEC decisions invariably come up to us, we would be treading into the
quicksand of thousands o</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">f </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conceivable situations, something which we, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">obviously, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">should </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">undertake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">I </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">believe that the remedy is in a better
supervision of the handling of the elections </span>at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the precinct level.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The problem
cannot be solved once the returns have been submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems that when our brothers and sisters
in </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mindanao</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> complain </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">indifference to their plight and neglect of their needs, they are not
referring to the infrastructure and economy alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Equally important is the development of
democratic and political processes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Implied in the allegations of massive fraud is that government officials
either participated in or were indifferent to the cheating.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither the COMELEC nor this Court can do
much if certain officials who should guard the polls with zeal take advantage
of the situation or condone the perpetration of anomalies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In suggesting that
Congress should strike a new and different equilibrium in the balancing of the
public interests at stake, we may not be going into the heart of the
problem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Statistically improbable
results may flatter the ego of incumbent officials but they insult the
intelligence and reflect a failure to help the voters express their free and
genuine will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is needed is a system
which makes public officers and political leaders lead the way towards </span>political
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">maturity.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
