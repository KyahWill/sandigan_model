				G.R. No. 64250, September 30, 1983</h4>
				<H3>SUPERLINES TRANSPORTATION CO., INC. AND ERLITO LORCA, PETITIONERS,
VS. HON. LUIS L. VICTOR, JUDGE PRESIDING OVER BRANCH XVI OF THE REGIONAL
TRIAL COURT OF CAVITE; TIMOTEA T. MORALDE, CAYETANO T. MORALDE, JR., ALEXANDER
T. MORALDE, RAMON T. MORALDE, EMMANUEL T. MORALDE, AND JOCELYN MORALDE
ABELLANA, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>ESCOLIN, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A petition for <i>certiorari</i> to set aside the decision of the
Intermediate Appellate Court CA-G.R. No. SP-00708 entitled "Superlines
Transportation Co., Inc., et al. versus Hon. Luis L. Victor, et al.,"
which affirmed the orders dated March 28 and April 27, 1983 of herein
respondent Judge Luis L. Victor in Civil Case No. N-4338 of the Regional Trial
Court of Cavite, entitled "Timotea T. Moralde, et al. versus Pantranco
South Express, Inc., et al."</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 19, 1982, Bus No. 3008 of the Pantranco South
Express, Inc., Pantranco for short, driven by Rogelio Dillomas, collided with
Bus No. 331 of the Superlines Transportation Co., Inc., Superlines for short,
then driven by Erlito Lorca along the highway at Lumilang, Calauag, Quezon,
resulting in the instantaneous death of Cayetano P. Moralde, passenger in the
Pantranco bus.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 4, 1983, Superlines instituted an action for damages
before the then Court of First Instance of Quezon, Gumaca Branch, against
Pantranco and Rogelio Dillomas, driver of said Pantranco Bus No. 3008.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its complaint, docketed as Civil Case No.
1671-G, Superlines alleged that the recklessness and negligence of the
Pantranco bus driver was the proximate cause of the accident and that there was
want of diligence on the part of Pantranco in the selection and supervision of
its driver.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 11, 1983, private respondents Timotea T. Moralde,
widow of the deceased Cayetano P. Moralde, Sr., and her children, Cayetano,
Jr., Alexander, Ramon, Emmanuel, all surnamed Moralde, and Jocelyn M. Abellana,
filed a complaint for damages, docketed as Civil Case No. N-4338 of the
Regional Trial Court of Cavite City, against Superlines and its driver, Erlito
Lorca, as well as Pantranco and its driver, Rogelio Dillomas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action pleaded against Superlines
was based on quasi-delict, while that against Pantranco, on culpa-contractual.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 28, 1983, herein petitioners Superlines and its
driver Erlito Lorca filed a motion to dismiss in Civil Case No. N-4338 on the
ground of pendency of another action, obviously referring to Civil Case No. 1671-G
pending before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon, Gumaca Branch.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding that the two cases (Civil Cases No. 1671-G and No.
N-4338) involved different parties as well as different causes of action,
respondent Judge Luis Victor denied the motion to dismiss in the challenged
order of March 28, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Superlines
moved for a reconsideration, but the same was denied on April 27, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied, Superlines filed with the Intermediate Appellate
Court a petition for <i>cer­tiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary
injunction, which petition, however, was denied due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this present recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is suggested by petitioners that private respondents Moraldes
should pursue their claim for damages by intervening in the Gumaca action, pur­suant
to Sec. 2, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court and in the light of Municipality of
Hagonoy v. Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources [73 SCRA 507] and
Orellano v. Alvestir [76 SCRA 536].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is contended that since the right of private respond­ents to claim damages is
founded on the same facts involved in the Gumaca action, any judgment rendered
therein will amount to <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> in the Cavite case, for
whatever adjudication is made in the former case between Pantranco and
Superlines as regards either of the parties' culpability would set said issue
at rest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, such intervention
would prevent multiplicity of suits and avoid confusion that may arise should
the trial courts render conflicting decisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' stand is consistent with our ruling in the case of
Marapao v. Mendoza, 119 SCRA 97, where We held that:</p>

<blockquote>"While respondent Castillo has not been impleaded in the Bohol
case, she has similar interests as Hotel de Mercedes, the defendant therein
which is her employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and
private respondent both claim damages based on the same incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A decision, whether in favor of petitioner or
private respondent in the Bohol case would amount to <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
in the Cebu case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Damages in favor of
one party would preclude damages in favor of the other.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is an additional reason for dismissal, and that is, to
avoid multipli­city of suits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ago
Timber Co. v. Hon. Ruiz, et al., 21 SCRA 138 (1967); Erlanger v. Villamor, 98
Phil. 1003 (1956); Teodoro, Jr. v. Mirasol, 99 Phil. 150 (1956).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To protect the interests of respondent employee, she may
inter­vene as a party in the Bohol case and file a counterclaim for damages
against petitioner."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, a more pragmatic solution to the controversy
at bar; and that is to consolidate the Gumaca case with the Cavite case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considerations of judicial economy and
administration, as well as the convenience of the parties for which the rules
on procedure and venue were formulated, dictate that it is the Cavite court,
rather than the Gumaca court, which serves as the more suitable forum for the
deter­mination of the rights and obligations of the parties concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">As observed by both the trial and appellate courts, to require
private respondents who are all residents of Kawit, Cavite, to litigate their claims
in the Quezon Court would unnecessarily expose them to considerable
expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, no like
prejudice would befall the defendants transportation companies if they were
required to plead their causes in Cavite, for such change of venue would not
expose them to expenses which they are not already liable to incur in
connection with the Gumaca case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
objec­tion interposed by Superlines that it has its offices in Atimonan,
Quezon, should not detract from the over­all convenience affored by the
consolidation of cases in the Cavite Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For apart from the fact that petitioner and its driver are represented
by the same counsel with offices located in Manila, defendants transportation
companies can readily avail of their facilities for conveying their witnesses
to the place of trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ordered consolidation of cases, to our mind, crystallizes
into reality the thinking of our predecessors that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The whole purpose and object of procedure is to make
the powers of the court fully and completely available for justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most perfect procedure that can be de­vised
is that which gives opportunity for the most complete and perfect exercise of
the powers of the court within the limitations set by natural justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is that one which, in other words, gives
the most perfect opportunity for the powers of the court to transmute
themselves into concrete acts of justice between the parties before it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of such a procedure is not to
restrict the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter, but to give it
effective facility in righteous action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It may be said in passing that the most salient objection which can be
urged against proce­dure today is that it so restricts the exercise of the
court's powers by technicalities that that part of its authority effective for
justice between the parties is many times an inconsiderable portion of the
whole.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of procedure is not
to thwart justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its proper aim is to
facilitate the application of justice to the rival claims of contending
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was created not to hinder
and delay but to facilitate and promote the administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not cons­titute the thing itself
which courts are always striving to secure to litigants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is designed as the means best adapted to
ob­tain that thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, it
is a means to an end.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the means by
which the powers of the court are made effective in just judgments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When it loses the character of the one and
takes on that of the other the administration of justice becomes incomplete and
unsatisfactory and lays itself open to grave criticism." (Manila Railroad
Co. vs. Attorney-General, 20 Phil. 523)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is hereby denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Civil Case No. 1671-G of the Regional Trial
Court of Quezon is hereby ordered consolidated with Civil Case No. N-4338
pending before the Regional Trial Court of Cavite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Regional Trial Court of Quezon, Gumaca
Branch, is directed to transfer, without unnecessary delay, the records of
Civil Case No. 1671-G to the Re­gional Court of Cavite, Branch XVI.</p>
