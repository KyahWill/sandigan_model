This is a Petition for Review on <em>Certiorari </em>of the Decision of 
the then Court of Appeals, promulgated on December 24, 1980, in CA-G.R. 
No. 55959-R, entitled "National Power Corporation, Plaintiff-Appellant, 
versus B. E. San Diego, Inc., Defendant-Appellant."
<p>
In 1961, petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC, for short), 
commenced negotiations with the spouses Esteban Sadang and Maria 
Lachica, then the registered owners, for the purchase of a portion of 
8,746 sq. ms. of the latter's parcel of land of 62,285 sq. ms., situated
 in Barrio San Mateo, Norzagaray, Bulacan, for the purpose of 
constructing an access road to its Angat River Hydroelectric Project. 
Although the negotiations were not yet concluded, NPC never­theless 
obtained permission from said spouses to begin construction of the 
access road, which it did in November 1961.
</p><p>
On December 7, 1962, B. E. San Diego, Inc. a realty firm and private 
respondent herein (SAN DIEGO, for short), acquired the parcel of land at
 a public auction sale and was issued a title.
</p><p>
On February 14, 1963, NPC instituted proceedings for eminent domain 
against the spouses Sadang in the Court of First Instance of Bulacan 
(Civil Case No. 2725), later amended on June 20, 1963, with leave of 
Court, to implead SAN DIEGO. The Motion to Amend was only granted on 
June 21, 1968. On March 19, 1969, the Trial Court appointed three 
Commissioners, one for each of the parties and another for the Court, to
 receive the evidence and determine the just compensation to be paid for
 the property sought to be expropriated. After the Commissioners had 
submitted their individual Reports and after evaluating the evidence 
adduced, the Trial Court rendered a Decision on March 28, 1973, the 
dispositive portion of which reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
        a)      Declaring to plaintiff the full and legal right to 
acquire by eminent domain the absolute ownership over the portion of the
 land referred to in Paragraphs 4 and 9 of the Amended Complaint, 
consisting of 8,746 square meters, access road of the plaintiff to its 
Angat River Hydroelectric Project;
    </p>
    <p>
        b)      Authorizing the payment by plaintiff to defendant of the
 amount of P31,922.00 as full indemnity for the property at the rate of 
P3.75 per square meter, with interest at 12% per annum from March 11, 
1963 until fully paid;
    </p>
    <p>
        c)      A final Order of Condemnation over the property and 
improvements therein is entered, for the purpose set forth, free from 
all liens and encumbrances;
    </p>
    <p> d)      Ordering the registration of this Act of Expro­priation,
 at plaintiff's expense, with the Register of Deeds of Bulacan at the 
back of defendant's title to the whole property. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> SO ORDERED."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Both parties appealed to the then Court of Appeals, which rendered a Decision on December 24, 1980, decreeing:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Considering the peculiar facts and circumstances obtaining in the
 present case, it is our considered view that the just and reasonable 
compensation for the property in question is P7.00 per square meter. </p>
  <p>
    ACCORDINGLY, the judgment appealed from is hereby modified as indicated above. No costs.
  </p>
  <p> SO ORDERED."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Reconsideration having been denied, NPC availed of the present recourse,
 to which due course was given. SAN DIEGO did not appeal from the 
Appellate Court judgment although it filed a Brief.
</p><p>
The issues presented are whether or not respondent Court erred (1) in 
fixing the amount of P7.00 per square meter as just compensation for the
 portion of land sought to be expropriated based on its planned 
convertibility into a residential subdivision; and (2) in not reducing 
the rate of interest payable by NPC from twelve (12%) per cent to six 
(6%) per cent per annum.
</p><p>
The Trial Court and respondent Court assessed the conflicting evidence 
in different lights. Reproduced below are partial findings of the Trial 
Court:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The plaintiff's commissioner, to begin with, recommended a price 
of P0.50 per square meter; defendant's commissioner indicated P20.00 per
 square meter, while the commissioner of the Court pegged the value at 
P4.00 per square meter. The total road area consists of 8,746 square 
meters (Exhibits 4-4-c, inclusive). Against the sketch (Exhibit D-1) 
presented by plaintiff, the former should prevail. </p>
  <p>
  There is competent testimony, too, that the land was cogonales at the 
time of the occupancy. During rainy season, according to Celedonio 
Juarez, Instrumentman of Survey Team of the plaintiff, the proposed road
 could only be passable by animal drawn sledges; that in contrast, the 
accessway under its present condition is fully paved. Shaped to a curve,
 the thoroughfare should provide a marked improvement to the flourishing
 housing subdivision managed by the defendant.
  </p>
  <p>
  Also, the prevailing market price of residential lots in the area, 
according to the reputable C. M. Montano Realty, is P20.00 per square 
meter. Even taking the face value of the appraisal made, it would be 
unfair to compel plaintiff to pay the same price after constructing a 
30-meter wide road through the property a decade ago which enhanced its 
commercial value, not to mention the aesthetic gain. Safe to say, 
therefore, except for the cost of the land area encompassed by the road,
 there is negligible, if any, consequential damage to speak of.
  </p>
  <p>
  Defendant's contention, on the other hand, that the location of the 
road is burdensome appears to be more idealistic than meritorious. <em>The
 right of way as now built is more beneficial to the adjoining 
subdivision owner (defendant) in the sense that the residential lot on 
both flanks of the road could command a higher price. This may not hold 
true if the access road were to be built on the east side boundary as 
proposed by the defendant because only one side of the road may be 
devoted to the housing area</em>. x x x Related is evidence from 
defendant that the plaintiff had once negotiated to purchase the 
property at P5.00 per square meter. At first glance, this would appear 
significant and in keeping with the fair market value. But noticeably, 
the offer was made some nine (9) years after actual taking. It is 
pertinent to point out, the spouses Sadang when first contacted by the 
plaintiff in 1961, offered to part with the piece of property at P4.00 
per square meter. The difference in the price could be reasonably traced
 to the fact that the couple then may not have any concrete plan to 
develop the area into a subdivision until the defendant came into the 
picture. But the Sadangs were the registered owners at the time of 
actual occupancy, defendant's mortgage lien notwithstanding. Being so, 
they were clothed with legal personality to enter into any transaction 
with the plaintiff. <em>The property was agricultural, in use as well as for taxation purposes</em>. (Exhibits A and B). Privy to this fact, the spouses were presumably aware of the reasonableness of their offer to sell.
  </p>
  <p> "Thus, 'the fair market value of the land sought to be 
expropriated', according to the Supreme Court, 'should be determined 
either at the time of actual taking or at the time of the filing of the 
complaint, whichever is earlier. The future convertibility of the 
property into some other classification does not affect the nature of 
property.' (Alfonso <em>vs</em>. Pasay City, G.R. No. L-12754, January 30, 1960). </p>
  <p align="center">
    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>xx<span style="">x</span></p>
  <p> "ALL CONSIDERED, P3.75 a square meter is and represents the fair market value" (Italics ours). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, respondent Court reasoned thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It has been amply shown that the defendant purchased the land for
 the purpose of converting the same into a first class residential 
subdivision. The court's commissioner and the trial court itself took 
cognizance of such project of the defendant (pp. 130-131, 163, Record on
 Appeal). It is worthwhile to note that, before the access road was 
cons­tructed on the property, plaintiff had already known of the 
defendant's plan of converting the land into a subdivision, since 
plaintiff had in his custody a copy of defendant's subdivision plan, 
Exhibit 7. In point of fact, Exhibit 7 was produced in court by the 
plaintiff from its own record (p. 97, Record on Appeal). Evidence has 
also been adduced to show that, as appraised by C.M. Montano Realty, the
 prevailing market price of residential lots in the vicinity of 
defendant's land was P20.00 per square meter (p. 163, <em>Ibid</em>). </p>
  <p> "Defendant further maintains that because the access road was not 
constructed in a straight line, the property was unnecessarily divided 
into three separate and irregular segments (Exhibit 4). According to the
 court's commissioner, <em>the road, as actually laid out, had rendered the owner's plan of converting the land into a subdivision 'futile</em>'. </p>
  <p align="center">
    x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></p>
  <p> "Needless to state, plaintiff should have given heed to the above 
legal prescription (Art. 650, Civil Code) by having constructed the road
 in a straight line in order to cover the shortest distance, and thus 
cause the least prejudice to the defendant. Plaintiff failed to observe 
this rule, and no explanation has been offered for such neglect. <em>These
 facts contradict the conclusion of the lower court that 'except for the
 cost of the land encompassed by the road, there is neglible, if any, 
consequential damage to speak of</em>.' (p. 164, Record on Appeal). </p>
  <p> "It is noted that the only basis of the court a quo in assessing 
the just compensation of the property at the price of P3.75 per square 
meter is that at the time of act­ual occupancy by the plaintiff, 'the 
property was agricultural in use as well as for taxation purposes 
(Exhibits A and D (p. 165 Record on Appeal).' But such posture is hardly
 in accord with the settled rule that 'in determining the value of the 
land appropriated for public purposes, the same considerations are to be
 regarded as in a sale of property between private parties. The inquiry,
 in such cases, must always be not what the property is worth in the 
market, viewed not merely as to the uses to which it is at the time 
applied, but with reference to the uses to which it is plainly adopted; 
that is to say, what is its worth from its availability for valuable 
uses?' (City of Manila <em>vs</em>. Corrales, 32 Phil. 85, 98). It has 
also been held 'that the owner has a right to its value for the use for 
which it would bring the most in the market' (City of Manila <em>vs</em>. Corrales, supra; Republic <em>vs</em>. Venturanza, et al. 17 SCRA 322, 327). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, we cannot lightly brush aside the evidence showing that 
plaintiff's failure to observe the rule for laying out the right of way 
easement in a straight line had prevented the defendant from carrying 
out its plan of converting the property into a housing subdivision. This
 consequential damage must be taken into account in the assessment of 
the just compensation of the property" (Italics supplied).
</p><p>
After a review of the records, we are of the considered opinion that the
 findings of the Trial Court merit our approval for several reasons:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> (1)            Both documentary and oral evidence indicate that 
the land in question, at the time of taking by NPC in 1961, was 
agricultural in use as well as for taxation purposes. In fact, it was 
described as "cogonales". </p>
  <p> (2)            SAN DIEGO's contention that the location and 
di­rection of the access road is burdensome is not borne out by the 
evidence. The Report of the Commissioner of the Court revealed that NPC 
merely improved a pre-existing mining road on the premises, which was 
only accessible by carabao-drawn sledge during the rainy season.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  As concluded by the Trial Court, which had the benefit of autoptic observation:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Defendant's contention, on the other hand, that the location of
 the road is burdensome appears to be more idealistic than meritorious. 
The right of way as now built is more beneficial to the adjoining 
subdivision owner (defendant) in the sense that the residential lot on 
both flanks of the road could command a higher price. This may not hold 
true if the access road were to be built on the east side boundary as 
proposed by the defendant because only one side of the road may be 
devoted to the housing area."
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> (3)            The finding of the Trial Court that "there is 
neg­ligible, if any, consequential damage to speak of" thus be­comes 
readily tenable. SAN DIEGO was not, as was the belief of respondent 
Court, "prevented from carrying out the plan of converting the property 
into a housing subdivision." On the contrary, the Trial Court observed 
that "the thoroughfare should provide a marked improvement to the <em>flourishing housing subdivision </em>managed by defendant (private respondent."
  </p>
  <p> (4)            The appraisal by a realty firm of P20.00 per square
 meter, the price that SAN DIEGO stresses the property should command, 
is not, to our minds, a fair market value. The former owners, the Sadang
 spouses, offered to part with the property at P4.00 per square meter. 
SAN DIEGO had purchased the entire property of 62,285 square meters at 
public auction for P10,000.00, or at P0.16 per square meter. Previous to
 that, or in 1957, the property was mortgaged to the Develop­ment Bank 
of the Philippines for P20,000.00 and subsequently in 1958 to SAN DIEGO,
 by way of second mortgage, for P30,000.00. The observation of the Trial
 Court, on this point, is decidedly apropos: </p>
  <p align="center">
  x x x
  </p>
  <p> "A very important point: On the basis of a recog­nized policy of 
lending institutions to grant a maximum mortgage loan corresponding to 
60% of the appraised value of the real estate collaterals, the twenty 
thousand mortgage loan extended by the Development Bank of the 
Philippines to the spouses Sadang would roughly place the approximate 
value of the property at P33,330 or roughly P0.51 per square meter. And 
at this ratio, by granting a second mortgage of P30,000, the defendant 
impliedly placed the recoverable value of the property within P83,333.33
 for the area of 62,285 square meters or about P1.33 per square meter. 
That was in 1958, the year of the second mortgage (Exhibit 12), or an 
annual increase in price at the rate of P0.81 per square meter. From 
1958 to 1961 (date of actual taking) represents three years, or an 
aggregate increase of P2.43 per square meter. Add P1.32 to this thus 
making a total of P3.75 per square meter."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The price of P12.00 to P15.00, which respondent Court observed as the 
just compensation awarded in two civil suits for lands condemned in the 
immediate vicinity, cannot be a fair gauge since said Court neither 
adopted the same, and specially considering that the property was 
"cogonal" at the time NPC constructed its access road in 1961. Moreover,
 NPC also presented contrary evidence indicating prices of P.05 and P.06
 per square meter at around the time it had entered the property. In 
fact, in respect of sales within the locality, the Trial Court had this 
to say:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "While sales of properties within the locality in the same year or
 thereabout may serve as a guiding factor in ascertaining a fair market 
value yet there appears want of proof to show that the alluded sales 
(Exhibits I-1, J, K, and L) referred to properties of similar nature nor
 was proximity to the land in question properly shown."
  </p>
  <p>
    (5)  And most importantly, on the issue of just compensation, it is 
now settled doctrine, following the leading case of Alfonso <em>vs</em>. Pasay<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
 , that to determine due compensation for lands appropriated by the 
Government, the basis should be the price or value at the time it was 
taken from the owner and appropriated by the Government.
  </p>
  <p> "The owner of property expropriated by the State is entitled to 
how much it was worth at the time of the taking. This has been clarified
 in Republic <em>vs</em>. PNB (1 SCRA 957) thus: 'It is apparent from 
the foregoing that, when plaintiff takes possession before the 
institution of the condemnation proceedings, the value should be fixed 
as of the time of the taking of said possession, not of filing of the 
complaint, and that the latter should be the basis for the determination
 of the value, when the taking of the property involved coincides with 
or is subsequent to, the commencement of the proceedings. Indeed, 
otherwise, the provision of Rule 69, section 3, directing that 
compensation 'be determined as of the date of the filing of the 
com­plaint' would never be operative."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar, the taking by NPC occurred in November 1961, when it
 constructed the access road on, the expropriated property at time when 
it was still "cogonal" and owned by the spouses Sadang. The Complaint 
was filed only in 1963.
</p><p>
The convertibility of the property into a subdivision, the criterion 
relied upon by respondent Court, is not controlling. The case of Manila 
Electric Co. <em>vs</em>. Tuason, 60 Phil. 663, 668, cited in Municipal Govt. of Sagay <em>vs</em>. Jison<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> , has categorically ruled that it is the time of taking and not as "potential building" site that is the determining factor,
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x if the property to be expropriated was agricultural, the 
adaptability thereof for conversion in the future into a residential 
site does not affect its nature when plaintiff assumed possession of the
 property, although it is a circumstance that should be considered in 
determi­ning its value at that time, as an 'agricultural' land."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The doctrines in the cases of City <em>vs</em>. Corrales, 32 Phil. 85 (1915) and Republic <em>vs</em>. Venturanza, 17 SCRA 322 (1966) relied upon by respondent Court must be deemed to have been superseded not only by the <em>Alfonso, Carlota, </em>and<em> Sagay</em> cases but also by Republic <em>vs</em>. Narciso, 99 Phil. 1031 (1956); Republic <em>vs</em>. Philippine National Bank, 1 SCRA 957 (1961); and Republic <em>vs</em>.
 Juan, 92 SCRA 26 (1979), all of which held that the nature of the land 
at the time of taking by the Government is the principal criterion for 
awarding compensation to the landowner. The subdivision was not in 
existence when NPC entered the land.
</p><p>
Since SAN DIEGO bought the land in question in the interim and was 
issued a title only on December 7, 1962, the "taking" as to it should 
commence only from said date.
</p><p>
On the issue of legal interest in expropriation proceedings, we held in Amigable <em>vs</em>. Cuenca, 43 SCRA 360 (1972), that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As regards the claim for damages, the plaintiff is entitled 
thereto in the form of legal interest on the price of the land from the 
time it was taken up to the time that payment is made by the government.
 In addition, the government should pay for attorneys fees, the amount 
of which should be fixed by the trial court after hearing."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar, legal interest should accrue from December 7, 1962, 
the time of taking as far as SAN DIEGO is concerned, at six per cent 
(6%) per annum, up to the time that payment is made by NPC.
</p><p>
Not having appealed from the Decision of respondent Court, SAN DIEGO 
cannot ask for its modification by way of increasing the amount of 
compensation and including an award for attorney's fees.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of respondent Appellate Court, dated December 
24, 1980, is hereby set aside, and the Decision of the then Court of 
First Instance of Bulacan, Branch I, in Civil Case No. 2725, authorizing
 payment of P31,922.00 as full indemnity for the property at the rate of
 P3.75 per square meter is reinstated. Petitioner is directed to pay 
interest at six per cent (6%) per annum on the amount ad­judged from 
December 7, 1962, until fully paid. No costs.
