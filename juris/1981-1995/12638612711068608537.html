<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner contends
that in refusing to consider the objections raised by him to 26 election
returns (later reduced to 24) before the board of canvassers because the
rulings thereon were not in writing, the COMELEC has effectively and illegally
denied him the right to appeal through no fault of his.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The basis of such refusal
is Section 245 of the Omnibus Election Code providing in part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sec. 245.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><u>Contested election returns</u>. - <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Within twenty-four hours from and after the presentation of a
verbal objection, the same shall be submitted in written form to the board of
canvassers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the board of
canvassers shall take up each contested return, consider the written objections
thereto and summarily rule thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
ruling shall be made oral initially and then reduced to writing by the board within
twenty-four hours from the time the oral ruling is made.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any party adversely affected by an oral ruling on its/his objection
shall immediately state orally whether it/he intends to appeal said
ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said intent to appeal shall
be stated in the minutes of the canvassing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If a party manifests its intent to appeal, the board of canvassers shall
set aside the return and proceed to rule on the other contested returns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When all the contested returns have been
ruled upon by it, the board of canvassers shall suspend the canvass and shall
make an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appropriate report to the
Commission, copy furnished the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from this provision that the board of canvassers is
under the obligation to make <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>written
ruling on the formal objections made by any of the parties, who may then appeal
the same to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COMELEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is equally clear that the failure
or refusal of the board of canvassers to discharge this obligation should not
in any way prejudice the objecting party's right to elevate the matter to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COMELEC </span>for proper review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, all that a board of canvassers
partial to one of the candidates has to do to favor him would be to refuse to
make a written ruling on his opponent's objections and thereby prevent their
review by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COMELEC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however, there does not appear to be any such
prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue is the refusal of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">COMELEC </span>to consider
objections to 24 election returns on which the board of canvassers had not made
a written ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it would seem
that, strictly speaking, no ruling was necessary, or even proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the petitioners' own contention "in
all those 24 returns, the Christian name, nickname or maternal surname of
private respondent's husband was used with her Christian name or nickname
which, as we will show at length <u>infra</u>, did not constitute a valid vote
for private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If so, the total
1,912 votes in these returns credited for private respondent should be
discounted."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This matter was obviously beyond the competence of the board of canvassers to
resolve.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither was it cognizable in a
pre-proclamation controversy before the COMELEC as defined in Section 243 of
the Omnibus Election Code. </p>

<p class="BODY">This provision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 243.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Issues that may
be raised in pre-proclamation controversy</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>- The following shall be proper issues that may be raised in a
pre-proclamation controversy:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) Illegal composition or proceedings of the board of canvassers;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) The canvassed election returns are incomplete, contain material
defects, appear to be tampered with or falsified, or contain discrepancies in
the same returns or in other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">authentic
copies thereof as mentioned in Sections 233, 234, 235 and 236 of this Code;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) The election returns were prepared under duress, threats,
coercion, or intimidation, or they are obviously manufactured or not authentic;
and </blockquote>

<blockquote>(d) When substitute or fraudulent returns in <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
polling places were canvassed, the results of which materially <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">affected the standing of the aggrieved
candidate or candidates.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The inclusion or exclusion in the canvass of certain election
returns where votes allegedly cast for <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Larrazabal</span> were counted for his wife is an issue
appropriate in an election contest and not in a pre-proclamation
controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is also immaterial that,
as also contended, the inclusion of such votes would affect the over-all
results of the election and swing it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
</span>his favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accepted rule is
that as long as the returns appear to be authentic and duly accomplished, the
board of canvassers cannot look beyond them to verify allegations of
irregularities in the casting or the counting of the votes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
These issues cannot be resolved by the board of canvassers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A </span>long
line of decisions has established the doctrine that the board of canvassers has
only the <u>ministerial</u> task of tallying the votes as reported in the
election returns and cannot exercise the judicial power of deciding an election
contest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pre-proclamation controversies are summary in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Section 246 of the Omnibus
Election Code:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 246.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Summary
proceedings before the Commission</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-
All pre-proclamation controversies shall be heard summarily by the Commission
after due notice and hearing, and its decisions shall be <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
after the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> lapse of five days from
receipt by the losing party of the decision of the Commission, unless
restrained by the Supreme Court.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And the reason for this rule is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we stressed in <span class="SpellE">Alonto</span>
v. COMELEC,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
"the policy of the election law is that pre-proclamation controversies
should be summarily decided, consistent with the law's desire that the canvass
and proclamation be delayed as little as possible." That is why such
questions as those involving the appreciation of the votes and the conduct of
the campaign and the balloting, which require more deliberate and necessarily
longer consideration, are left for examination in the corresponding election
protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot accept the petitioner's averment that the public
respondent made short shrift of his objections and resolved them arbitrarily,
without considering the evidence submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We see </span>no such
arbitrariness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, we find
that the questioned resolution of the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">banc</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">, </span>which unanimously affirmed the unanimous decision of its Second
Division, was based on the facts as assessed by the public respondent in the
light of the applicable election laws and jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The basic decision of the Second Division was
33 pages long and dealt in detail with the specific objections, the rulings of
the board of canvassers, and the action thereon of the COMELEC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

speaking of the need to preserve the "independence and all the needed
concomitant powers" of the Commission on Elections, Justice Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> declared that "it is but proper that the Court

<p class="BODY">The contention that the dismissal of the pre-proclamation

is to prevent the candidate from running or, if elected, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from serving, or to prosecute him for
violation of the election laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, the mere fact that a candidate has been </span>p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">roclaimed </span>elected does not signify
that his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">disqualification </span>is
deemed condoned and may no longer be the subject of a separate investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In SPC No. 88-546, the petitioners seek to disqualify the private
respondent on the g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">round </span>that
she misrepresented her residence in her certificate of candidacy as <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Kananga</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The charge is that she was in fact and under the law a resident of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ormoc</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
like her husband, who was disqualified precisely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">on that </span>account from running for provincial governor of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the hearing on this issue, the private
respondent moved for clarification of the nature of the proceeding and asked
the COMELEC to determine under what law her qualifications were being
challenged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That determination was
embodied in the decision of the Second Division dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="2">February 3, 1989</st1:date>, and the <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1989</st1:date>,
which are now assailed in G.R. No. 88004.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the COMELEC, the proceeding was not intended against
an alleged nuisance candidate under Section 69 of the Election Code as it was
obvious that the private respondent was a serious <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">bona</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>fide</u> </span>candidate,
nor was it a petition for <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> </span>under
Section 253 which could be filed only after the proclamation of the
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither could it be
considered a petition to deny due course to the certificate of candidacy under
Section 78 of the Code <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>this
was not prayed for by the petitioners, besides the fact that the petition was
not filed before the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
it could also not be considered a petition for disqualification under Section
68 of the Code because the private respondent was not being charged with the
commission of any of the election offenses mentioned in that section.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Concluding, the COMELEC held that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the subject of the </span>petition, to wit,
misrepresentation in the certificate of candidacy, was actually a violation of
Section 74 and, pursuant to its rules, should be prosecuted as an election
offense under Section 262 of the Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It therefore dismissed SPC No. 88-546 and referred it to its Law
Department for proper action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court holds that the dismissal was improper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue of residence having been squarely
raised before it, it should not have been shunted aside to the Law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Department for a round-about investigation of
the private respondent's qualification through the filing of a criminal
prosecution, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">found to be warranted, with resultant
disqualification of the accused in case of conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">COMELEC should have opted for a
more direct and speedy process available under the law, considering the vital
public interest involved </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the necessity of resolving </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the view of the Court,
the pertinent provision is Section 78 in relation to Section 6 of R.A. No.
6646.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Section 78 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

later than twenty-five days from the time of the filing of the certificate of
candidacy and shall be decided, after due notice and hearing, not later than
fifteen days before the election.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 6 of R.A. 6646 states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Section 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Effect of Disqualification Case</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- </span>Any
candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not
be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If for any reason a candidate is not declared
by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and
receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission
shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry, or protest
and, upon motion of the complainant or any <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
may during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> thereof order the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">suspension </span>of the proclamation of such
candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In rejecting this remedy,
the COMELEC makes much of the fact that the petition was filed on the very day
of the election and not before the election as required by Section 78.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Disregarded, however, is the other more
important fact that the private respondent's certificate of candidacy was filed
only on January 31, 1988, the day before the election, and that the petition to
disqualify her was filed almost immediately afterwards, in the morning of
election day itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, petitioner de la Cruz can hardly be faulted for not having filed
his challenge earlier, that is, during the remaining hours before </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of </span><st1:date year="1988" day="31" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January 31, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
make such </span>an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unreasonable
requirement is to make a rather strained reading of the law beyond its obvious
purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Interestingly, as
Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Haydee</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Yorac</span>
observed in her dissenting opinion, the private respondent had all of eighteen
days from her husband's disqualification to file her own certificate of
candidacy but waited to do so until practically the last day, and a Sunday at
that.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This raises the not untenable
conjecture that the filing was timed precisely to delay until too late the
expected challenge to her claimed residence and to thus foreclose all inquiry
into her credentials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fairness, it
may also be assumed that she had good reasons for filing her certificate of
candidacy one day before the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In any event, given the time allowance to file the challenge under
normal circumstances (twenty-five days under Section 78 and five days under
COMELEC Res. No. 1928)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> one cannot say that the challenge in this
case, although not filed earlier, was unseasonable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The above-stressed circumstances should explain the necessity for
continuing the investigation of the private respondent's challenged
disqualification even after the election notwithstanding that such matter is
usually resolved before the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Independently of these circumstances, such proceedings are allowed by
Section 6 of R.A. 6646 "if for any reason a candidate is not declared by
final judgment before an election to be disqualified x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court believes that, conformably to law and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>the particular interest of the
people of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, the question
of the private respondent's residence should be resolved by the respondent COMELEC
directly and as soon as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To this end, SPC No. 88-546 should be
recalled from its Law Department and returned to the Second Division for the
resumption of the hearing thereon and the reception of the evidence of the
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This should be done with all
deliberate dispatch so that the delay that has attended the disposition of this
case since the local election held on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="1" month="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">February 1, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> may at last be ended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the allegations contained in the petition, and in the
exercise of its discretion, the Court, as earlier related, issued a temporary
restraining order that has held in abeyance the canvass of the contested
election returns and the proclamation by the provincial board of canvassers of
the private respondent as Governor of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This order is now referred to the
COMELEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pending the final disposition
