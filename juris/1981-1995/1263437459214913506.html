				<H3>THE HEIRS OF GABRIEL CAPILI, PETITIONERS, VS. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HON. GUALBERTO J. DE LA LANA, PRESIDING JUDGE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF BULACAN, BRANCH XVI, MR. PERLITO G. DIMAGIBA, THE HEIRS OF LUIS SALAMAT AND PASCUALA SALAMAT, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case stems from a complaint, docketed Civil Case No. 7393-M,
for "Confirmation of Ownership (and) Recovery of Possession with Damages,"
filed on 30 March 1984 by private respondents against petitioners' predecessor,
the late Gabriel Capili, with the Regional Trial Court, Branch XVI - Malolos,
Bulacan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents alleged that they were co-owners and
co-possessors of a parcel of land, with an area of 327 square meters, situated
at Sta. Cruz, Paombong, Bulacan; that the property had, since 1961, been
occupied by Gabriel Capili merely through the tolerance of private respondents;
that when private respondents demanded that Capili vacate the premises, <span style="">the latter refused </span>and <span style="">instead </span><span style="">filed a Miscellaneous Sales Application </span>over <span style="">the lot, but that the application was denied </span>by
<span style="">the Bureau of Lands; and that on appeal
to the </span>then <span style="">Ministry of </span>Natural
<span style="">Resources, the latter, on 29 October
1982, affirmed the decision of the Bureau of </span><span style="">Lands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Capili was declared in
default in Civil Case No. 7393-M, and private respondents were allowed to
present their evidence <u>e</u></span><u><span style="">x</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">parte</span></u><span style="">. </span><span style="">On </span><span style="">30 </span><span style="">July 1984, the trial
court rendered a </span><span style="">decision, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">dispositive portion of which read:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the <span style="">plaintiffs </span>and against the defendant:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1)  declaring and/or confirming plaintiffs'
ownership over the parcel of land identified as Lot No. 2019, Cad-297;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2)  ordering the defendant as well as all
persons acting for and in his behalf to vacate the premises and to surrender
the possession of the subject property to the  plaintiffs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3)  ordering the defendant to pay actual damages
to the plaintiffs in the amount of P5,000.00;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4)  ordering the defendant to pay attorney's
fees in the amount of P5,000.00; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5)  ordering the defendant to pay <span style="">the costs of suit.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Capili filed, on 04 October 1984, a petition for relief from
judgment which the trial court denied in its order, dated 06 December 1984, for
lack of merit.  An appeal was interposed
with the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals).  On 18 October 1985, the appellate court
rendered a decision denying the petition, dismissing the case and lifting the
restraining order it previously issued.  A motion for reconsideration was denied in the appellate court's
resolution of 22 November 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, this petition for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
was filed with this Court raising the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT TRIAL JUDGE
COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN DENYING THE PETITION FOR RELIEF OF
JUDGMENT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHETHER OR NOT IN THE CASE AT BAR THE
DENIAL OF THE PETITION FOR RELIEF CAN BE REVIEWED BY A WRIT OF <i>CERTIORARI</i>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A supplemental petition, dated 07 May 1986, was subsequently
filed to state that the then Ministry of Natural Resources, in an order, dated
10 April 1986, modified its 29 October 1982 decision thusly:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decision of this Office dated
October 29, 1982 should be, as hereby it is, MODIFIED, in the sense that
appellant-movant Gabriel Capili shall be given priority over the western-half
portion of the lot in question where his house had been constructed, and the
other half shall be given to appellees Luis and Pascuala Salamat.  Accordingly, the Miscellaneous Sales
Application No. (III-6) 112 of Gabriel Capili shall be given further due course
for the western-half portion of the land and Luis and Pascuala Salamat shall be
given the privilege to apply under a proper public land application the
eastern-half portion, within sixty (60) days from finality of this Order.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"SO ORDERED.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondents
submitted their comment to the petition on 12 October 1987.   </span><span style="">Meanwhile,
</span><span style="">the Court, on 22 October 1987,
received </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">"notice of death of (Capili) and
substitution of (said) party by his heirs."  On 15 December 1987, petitioners submitted their reply to private
respondents' comment.  A rejoinder,
dated 10 February 1988, was made to the comment.  Thereafter, additional pleadings were filed by the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Ultimately, this Court
resolved to give due course to the petition and required the parties to submit
their respective memoranda.  The parties
complied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 April 1994, the parties this time, represented by their
attorneys-in-fact, submitted to this Court a compromise agreement, hereunder
reproduced in full; viz:</p>
