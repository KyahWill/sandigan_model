threshold of womanhood, deflowered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>repeatedly
abused by an older relative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case unfolded as follows.</p>

<p class="BODY">By sheer chance, Thelma <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
discovered that her thirteen year <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">old </span>daughter
Wilma's abdomen was suspiciously enlarging.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When confronted, Wilma divulged that she had been raped by her uncle and
neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Anecito</span> <span class="SpellE">Estebal</span>,
the accused-appellant herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Wilma
was examined by a physician, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi's</span>
suspicions were confirmed, as the examination showed that Wilma was by then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">six </span>months pregnant.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint for rape was filed against the accused before the
Municipal Trial Court and a warrant of arrest was issued by the municipal
judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After preliminary investigation,
the case was forwarded to the Provincial Fiscal and the accused was charged in
the Regional Trial Court with the crime of rape under the following
information:</p>

threatened to kill Wilma A. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> if she will
refuse to have sexual intercourse with him, and thereafter accused forcibly

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was tried and Wilma and her mother
testified for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prosecution, </span>while
the accused was the sole witness for the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In essence, their respective testimonies were
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>Wilma</u></b> <span class="SpellE"><b><u>Legaspi</u></b></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant testified that sometime in January 1986, when she was
thirteen (13) years of age and a Grade VI student at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dalangin</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
on her way back to school after taking her lunch at home, the accused stopped
her and pointed a bolo at her breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
then dragged her to the <span class="SpellE"><u>hagonoy</u></span> bushes and
threatened to kill her if she resisted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He took off her panty and then his pants and thereafter <span class="GramE">laid</span> on top of her and forcibly had sexual intercourse with
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She felt pain in her private parts
and noticed blood oozing <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After performing the sexual act, the accused
walked away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant went home,
but did not tell her parents or anybody else about the <span class="GramE">incident,</span>
for fear that the accused would make good the threat to kill her if she
did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she was raped
five (5) times by the accused, in the same manner, during the months of
February and March, 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that
her mother only came to know about what befell her when her pregnancy became apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The matter was reported to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain who caused the investigation of the case
and the arrest of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the
complainant was pregnant was confirmed when she was examined by a doctor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She later gave birth to a baby boy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">April

</span>The complainant's mother testified that her daughter was born on <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1972</st1:date> and is the third
among six (6) children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She described
how she was surprised to discover in July 1986 that Wilma's abdomen had
enlarged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspecting that Wilma was pregnant,
she confronted the latter who told her how she was raped by <span class="SpellE">Anecito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estebal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
and her husband brought Wilma to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain
to enlist his assistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain caused the arrest of the accused and the
investigation of the case by the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she and her husband brought Wilma to the doctor to be examined,
they were told that Wilma was already six (6) months pregnant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also said that Wilma gave birth to a baby
boy named Jorge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, but who died during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case after contracting an illness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="25" month="5">May

<span class="SpellE"><b><u>Estebal</u></b></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, who testified that he had known
the complainant for a very long time since they were neighbors and he was a
distant relative, said that sometime in January 1986, while he was helping the
complainant with her assignment, she started caressing him and he responded by
kissing her and touching her private parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They then proceeded to do the sexual act in the <span class="SpellE"><u>hagonoy</u></span>
bushes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that he never forced
Wilma into the sexual act as they subsequently had several more sexual
encounters during the next few months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He estimated that they probably had sexual intercourse at least one
hundred and fifty (150) times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that they usually had sexual intercourse in the <span class="SpellE"><u>hagonoy</u></span>
bushes after lunch when he was on his way back to work and she was returning to
school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1987</st1:date>, pp. 3-7.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of these testimonies and the documentary evidence,
the trial court found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of having

intercourse with the complainant on the date subject of the information [TSN,
July 27, 1987, p. 5] and on several other instances is admitted, as in fact the

and the complainant had sexual intercourse about one hundred and fifty (150)
times <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">[<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 6.] The

<p class="BODY">Thus, as in most rape cases, the primary issue is the credibility
of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The
truism that the charge of rape is easy to fabricate, hard to prove and harder
still to disprove [U.S v. </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Flores</span></st1:place><span class="GramE">, 26 Phil. 262 (1913); People v. <span class="SpellE">Barbo</span>,

significance in this case, as the only witness to the alleged rape is the
complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court apparently found the complainant's version of the
events worthy of belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it said:</p>

<blockquote>. . . [I]t will be inconsistent with human experience that a woman
who is thirteen (13) years old and a virgin would initiate a desire for sex
(sic) intercourse, since she is without experience and an innocent neophyte,
unless she is a child prostitute or a corrupted child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there were kisses and caress (sic) made by
the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Welma</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
when her assignment is being work (sic) on by the accused, which is interpreted
by him in his fertile mind as lewd, to the mind of the court, this could be an
expression of gratitude for being help for (sic) her assignment and for the
love of an uncle, but nothing less, she being a very young virgin and at the
flower of youth. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>[RTC Decision, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 19.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the trial court was evidently impressed by the manner
in which the complainant testified in court:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . The victim is very young and shy, and while testifying, she
was in tears but she answers responsibly and testified strait (sic) forward in
assertion. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>[RTC Decision, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 18.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that appellate courts will not disturb the trial
court's findings as to the credibility of the witness, the latter court having
heard the witness and having had the opportunity to observe closely her
deportment and manner of testifying, unless the trial court had plainly
overlooked facts of substance or value which, if considered, might affect the
result of the case [People v. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-27708, </span><st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 19, 1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 36 SCRA

323.]</span> The Court finds no cogent reason to depart from the rule, there
being no showing that material facts were overlooked by the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To ascertain the credibility of the
complainant's testimony and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>ensure
that there is no miscarriage of justice, the Court painstakingly went over the
transcript of her testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After doing
so, the Court is more than ever convinced that she had been truthful in her
answers to the questions propounded to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The answers were straightforward and coherent, further made believable
by the complainant's display of youthful candor and <span class="SpellE">naivete</span>
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">exemplified by her innocently describing
in detail the progression of the physiological reactions </span>of accused-appellant's
organ before and after the consummation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the intercourse and the difficulty </span>he encountered in penetrating
her private parts [TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1987</st1:date>,
pp<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. </span>11-13.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as oft-repeated by the Court in rape cases, it is
difficult to believe that young unmarried women would tell a story of
defloration, allow the examination of their private parts and thereafter permit
themselves to be the subject of a public trial, if they were not motivated by
an honest desire to seek justice [People v. <span class="SpellE">Selfaison</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-14732, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="28" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 28, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 1 SCRA 235; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>, G.R. No.</span>

<p class="BODY">2. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Accused-appellant
advances the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">view that his </span>guilt
for the crime charged had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court thought otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court, after reviewing the record,
likewise finds that his guilt has been so proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution, through the testimony of the complainant as
corroborated by that of her mother, and the documentary exhibits, had
established to a moral certainty that the accused-appellant had succeeded in
having carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pitted against this is the admission of the
accused-appellant of carnal knowledge with the complainant, coupled with the
incredible tale about the thirteen-year old complainant, his niece, acting like
a tramp and seducing him, and the two of them habitually having sexual
intercourse during her lunch break some one hundred and fifty (150) times in a
span of a few months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That truth is
often stranger than fiction may be a proven adage, but certainly there are
limits to human credulity.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Considering that the
Court in several recent decisions has increased the award of damages in rape
cases to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> [People v. Villanueva, G.R. No.
50299, <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1988</st1:date>;
