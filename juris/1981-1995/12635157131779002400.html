Ombudsman may call upon government prosecutors for assistance in the investigation
and prosecution of criminal cases cognizable by his office and the conditions
under which he may do so.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner Gloria G. Lastimosa is First Assistant Provincial
Prosecutor of Cebu.  Because she and the
Provincial Prosecutor refused, or at any rate failed, to file a criminal charge
as ordered by the Ombudsman, an administrative complaint for grave misconduct,
insubordination, gross neglect of duty and maliciously refraining from <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>prosecuting crime was filed against her and
the Provincial Prosecutor and a charge for</span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt'> </span>indirect contempt was brought against them, both in the Office
of the Ombudsman.  In the meantime the
two were placed under preventive suspension.  This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition filed by
petitioner to set aside the orders of the Ombudsman with respect to the two
proceedings.</p>

<p class=BODY>The background of this case is as follows:</p>

<p class=BODY>On February 18, 1993 Jessica Villacarlos Dayon, public health
nurse of Santa Fe, Cebu, filed a criminal complaint for frustrated rape and an
administrative complaint for immoral acts, abuse of authority and grave
misconduct against the Municipal Mayor of Santa Fe, Rogelio Ilustrisimo.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The cases were filed with the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas where they were
docketed as OMB-VIS-(CRIM)-93-0140 and OMB-VIS-(ADM)-93-0036, respectively.</p>

<p class=BODY>The complaint was assigned to a graft investigation officer who,
after an investigation, found no <i>prima facie </i>evidence and accordingly
recommended the dismissal of the complaint.  After reviewing the matter, however, the Ombudsman, Hon. Conrado
Vasquez, disapproved the recommendation and instead directed that Mayor
Ilustrisimo be charged with attempted rape in the Regional Trial Court.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

<p class=BODY>Accordingly, in a letter dated May 17, 1994, the Deputy Ombudsman
for Visayas, respondent Arturo C. Mojica, referred the case to Cebu Provincial
Prosecutor Oliveros E. Kintanar for the &quot;filing of appropriate information
with the Regional Trial Court of Danao City, . . .”<a style='mso-footnote-id:

style='font-size:9.0pt'> </span>The case was eventually assigned to herein
petitioner, First Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Gloria G. Lastimosa.</p>

<p class=BODY>It appears that petitioner conducted a preliminary investigation
on the basis of which she found that only acts of lasciviousness had been
committed.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
With the approval of Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar, she filed on July 4, 1994
an information for acts of lasciviousness against Mayor Ilustrisimo with the
Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Santa Fe.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'

<p class=BODY>In two letters written to the Provincial Prosecutor on July 11,
1994 and July 22, 1994, Deputy Ombudsman Mojica inquired as to any action taken
on the previous referral of the case, more specifically the directive of the
Ombudsman to charge Mayor Ilustrisimo with attempted rape.<a style='mso-footnote-id:

<p class=BODY>As no case for attempted rape had been filed by the Prosecutor's
Office, Deputy Ombudsman Mojica ordered on July 27, 1994 Provincial Prosecutor
Kintanar and petitioner Lastimosa to show cause why they should not be punished
for contempt for &quot;refusing and failing to obey the lawful directives&quot;
of the Office of the Ombudsman.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"

<p class=BODY>For this purpose a hearing was set on August 1, 1994.  Petitioner and the Provincial Prosecutor
were given until August 3, 1994 within which to submit their answer.<a

was timely filed by them and hearings were thereupon <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'>conducted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>It appears that earlier, on July 22, 1994, two cases had been
filed against the two prosecutors with the Office of the Ombudsman for Visayas
by Julian Menchavez, a resident of Santa Fe, Cebu.  One was an administrative complaint for violation of Republic Act
No. 6713 and P.D. No. 807 (the Civil Service Law)<a style='mso-footnote-id:

and another one was a criminal complaint for violation of §3(e) of Republic Act
No. 3019 and Art. 208 of the Revised Penal Code.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11'
href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> The
complaints were based on the alleged refusal of petitioner<span

to charge Mayor Ilustrisimo with attempted rape.<span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>In the administrative case (OMB-VIS-(ADM)-94-0189) respondent
Deputy Ombudsman for Visayas Mojica issued an order on August 15, 1994, placing
petitioner Gloria G. Lastimosa and Provincial Prosecutor Oliveros E. Kintanar
under preventive suspension for a period of six (6) months,<a style='mso-footnote-id:

pursuant to Rule III, §9 of the Rules of Procedure of the Office of the
Ombudsman (Administrative Order No. 7), in relation to §24 of R.A. No.
6770.  The order was approved by Ombudsman
Conrado M. Vasquez on August 16, 1994 and on August 18, 1994 Acting Secretary
of Justice Ramon J. Liwag designated Eduardo Concepcion of Region VII as Acting
Provincial Prosecutor of Cebu.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, the Graft Investigation Officer II, Edgardo G.
Canton, issued orders<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13"

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> in
the two cases, directing petitioner and Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar to
submit their counter affidavits and controverting evidence.</p>

<p class=BODY>On September 6, 1994, petitioner Gloria G. Lastimosa filed the
present petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to set aside the
following orders of the Office of the Ombudsman and Department of Justice:</p>

<blockquote>(a)  Letter dated May 17, 1994 of Deputy
Ombudsman for Visayas Arturo C. Mojica and related orders, referring to the
Office of the Cebu Provincial Prosecutor the records of OMB-VIS-CRIM-93-0140,

Ombudsman &quot;for refusing and failing . . . to file the appropriate
Information for Attempted Rape against Mayor Rogelio Ilustrisimo.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)   The <u>1st Indorsement</u> dated August 9,
1994 of Acting Justice Secretary Ramon J. Liwag, ordering the Office of the
Provincial<span style='font-size:9.0pt'> </span>Prosecutor to comply with the

<p class=BODY>Petitioner raises a number of issues which will be discussed not
necessarily in the order they are stated in the petition.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>I.</p>

<p class=BODY>The pivotal question in this case is whether the Office of the Ombudsman
has the power to call on the Provincial Prosecutor to assist it in the
prosecution of the case for attempted rape against Mayor Ilustrisimo.  Lastimosa claims that the Office of the
Ombudsman and the prosecutor's office have concurrent authority to investigate
public officers or employees and that when the former first took cognizance of
the case against Mayor Ilustrisimo, it did so to the exclusion of the
latter.  It then became the duty of the
Ombudsman's office, according to petitioner, to finish the preliminary
investigation by filing the information in court instead of asking the Office
of the Provincial Prosecutor to do so.  Petitioner contends that the preparation and filing of the information
were part and parcel of the preliminary investigation assumed by the Office of
the Ombudsman and the filing of information in court could not be delegated by
it to the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor.  Petitioner defends her actuations in conducting a preliminary
investigation as having been made necessary by the insistence of the Ombudsman
to delegate the filing of the case to her office.<span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>In any event, petitioner contends, the Office of the Ombudsman
has no jurisdiction over the case against the mayor because the crime involved
(rape) was not committed in relation to a public office.  For this reason it is argued that the Office
of the Ombudsman has no authority to place her and Provincial Prosecutor
Kintanar under preventive suspension for refusing to follow his orders and to
cite them for indirect contempt for such refusal.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner's contention has no merit.  The Office of the Ombudsman has the power to &quot;investigate
and prosecute on its own or on complaint by any person, any act or omission of
any public officer or employee, office or agency, when such act or omission
appears to be illegal, unjust, improper or inefficient.”<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn14' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This power has been held to include the investigation and prosecution of any
crime committed by a public official regardless of whether the acts or
omissions complained of are related to, or connected with, or arise from the
performance of his official duty.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn15' href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> It
is enough that the act or omission was committed by a public official.  Hence, the crime of rape, when committed by
a public official like a municipal mayor, is within the power of the Ombudsman
to investigate and prosecute.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the exercise of his power, the Ombudsman is authorized to call
on prosecutors for assistance §31 of the Ombudsman Act of 1989 (R.A. No. 6770)
provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>Designation of Investigators and Prosecutors.</i>  -<i> </i>The Ombudsman may utilize the
personnel of his office and/or designate or deputize any fiscal, state
prosecutor or lawyer in the government service to act as special investigator
or prosecutor to assist in the investigation and prosecution of certain cases.  <u>Those designated or deputized to assist
him as herein provided shall be under his supervision and control</u>.  (Emphasis added)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It was on the basis of this provision that Ombudsman Conrado
Vasquez and Deputy Ombudsman Arturo C. Mojica ordered the Provincial Prosecutor
of Cebu to file an information for attempted rape against Mayor Rogelio
Ilustrisimo.<span style='font-size:27.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>It does not matter that the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor
had already conducted the preliminary investigation and all that remained to be
done was for the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor to file the corresponding
case in court.  Even if the preliminary
investigation had been given over to the Provincial Prosecutor to conduct, his
determination of the nature of the offense to be charged would still be subject
to the approval of the Office of the Ombudsman.  This is because under §31 of the Ombudsman's Act, when a
prosecutor is deputized, he comes under the &quot;supervision and control&quot;
of the Ombudsman which means that he is subject to the power of the Ombudsman
to direct, review, approve, reverse or modify his (prosecutor's) decision.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner cannot legally act on her own and refuse to prepare and file the
information as directed by the Ombudsman.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>II.</p>

<p class=BODY>The records show that despite repeated orders of the Ombudsman,
petitioner refused to file an information for attempted rape against Mayor
Ilustrisimo, insisting that after investigating the complaint in the case she
found that he had committed only acts of lasciviousness.</p>

<p class=BODY>§15(g) of the Ombudsman Act gives the Office of the Ombudsman the
power to &quot;punish for contempt, in accordance with the Rules of Court and
under the same procedure and with the same penalties provided therein.&quot;
There is no merit in the argument that petitioner and Provincial Prosecutor
Kintanar cannot be held liable for contempt because their refusal arose out of
an administrative, rather than judicial, proceeding before the Office of the
Ombudsman.  As petitioner herself says
in another context, the preliminary investigation of a case, of which the
filing of an information is a part, is quasi judicial in character.</p>

<p class=BODY>Whether petitioner's refusal to follow the Ombudsman's orders
constitutes a defiance, disobedience or resistance of a lawful process, order
or command of the Ombudsman thus making her liable for indirect contempt under
Rule 71, §3 of the<span style='font-size:9.0pt'> </span>Rules of Court is for
respondents to determine after appropriate hearing.  At this point it is important only to note the existence of the contempt
power of the Ombudsman as a means of enforcing his lawful orders.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>III.</p>

<p class=BODY>Neither is there any doubt as to the power of the Ombudsman to
discipline petitioner should it be found that she is guilty of grave
misconduct, insubordination and/or neglect of duty, nor of the Ombudsman's
power to place her in the meantime under preventive suspension.  The pertinent provisions of the Ombudsman
Act of 1989 state:</p>

<blockquote>§21.  <i>Officials Subject
To Disciplinary Authority; Exceptions.</i>  - The Office of the Ombudsman shall have disciplinary authority over all
elective and appointive officials of the Government and its subdivisions,
instrumentalities and agencies, including Members of the Cabinet, local
government, government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries,
except over officials who may be removed only by impeachment or over Members of
Congress, and the Judiciary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>§24.  <i>Preventive
Suspension.</i>  - The Ombudsman or his
Deputy may suspend any officer or employee under his authority pending an
investigation, if in his judgment the evidence of guilt is strong, and (a) the
charge against such officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or
grave misconduct or neglect in the performance of duty; (b) the charges would
warrant removal from the service; or (c) the respondent's continued stay in
office may prejudice the case filed against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The preventive suspension shall continue until the case is
terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six months, without
pay, except when the delay in the disposition of the case by the Office of the
Ombudsman is due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, in
which case the period of such delay shall not be counted in computing the
period of suspension herein provided.</blockquote>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>A.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner contends that her suspension is invalid because the
order was issued without giving her and Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar the
opportunity to refute the charges against them and because, at any rate, the
evidence against them is not strong as required by §24.  The contention is without merit.  Prior notice and hearing is not required,
such suspension not being a penalty but only a preliminary step in an
administrative investigation.  As held
in <i>Nera v. Garcia</i>:<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17"
name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>In connection with the suspension of petitioner before he could
file his answer to the administrative complaint, suffice it to say that the
suspension was not a punishment or penalty for the acts of dishonesty and
misconduct in office, but only as a preventive measure.  Suspension is a preliminary step in an
administrative investigation.  If after
such investigation, the charges are established and the person investigated is
found guilty of acts warranting his removal, then he is removed or dismissed.  This is the penalty.  <u>There is, therefore, nothing improper in
suspending an officer pending his investigation and before the charges against
him are heard and be given an opportunity to prove his </u><u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>innocence</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt'>.  </span>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It is true that, under §24 of the Ombudsman's Act, to justify the
preventive suspension of a public official, the evidence against him should be
strong, and any of the following circumstances is present:</p>

<p class=NUM>(a)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>the charge against such
officer or employee involves dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct or
neglect in the performance of duty;</p>

<p class=NUM>(b)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>the charges would warrant
removal from the service; or</p>

<p class=NUM>(c)<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>the respondent's
continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against him.</p>

<p class=BODY>As held in <i>Buenaseda v. Flavier</i>,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn18' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>however, whether the evidence of guilt is strong is left to the determination
of the Ombudsman by taking into account the evidence before him.  A preliminary hearing as in bail petitions
in cases involving capital offenses is not required.  In rejecting a similar argument as that made by petitioner in
this case, this Court said in that case:</p>

<blockquote>The import of the <i>Nera </i>decision is that the disciplining
authority is given the discretion to decide when the evidence of guilt is
strong.  This fact is bolstered by
Section 24 of R.A. No. 6770, which expressly left such determination of guilt
to the &quot;judgment&quot; of the Ombudsman on the basis of the administrative
complaint.…<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn19' href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In this case, respondent Deputy Ombudsman Mojica justified the
preventive suspension of petitioner and Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar on the
following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>A careful assessment of the facts and circumstances of the herein
cases and the records pertaining thereto against respondents [Provincial
Prosecutor Kintanar and herein petitioner] clearly leads to the conclusion that
the evidence on record of guilt is strong and the charges involved offenses of
grave misconduct, gross neglect of duty and dishonesty which will warrant
respondents [Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar and herein petitioner] removal from
the service.  Moreover, considering the
unabashed attitude of respondents in openly announcing various false pretexts
and alibis to justify their stubborn disregard for the lawful directives of the
Ombudsman as their official position in their pleadings filed in
OMB-VIS-0-94-0478 and in print and broadcast media, the probability is strong
that public service more particularly in the prosecution of cases referred by
the Office of the Ombudsman to the Cebu Provincial Prosecutor's office will be
disrupted and prejudiced and the records of said cases even be tampered with if
respondents [Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar and herein petitioner] are allowed
to stay in the Cebu Provincial Prosecutor's Office during the pendency of these
proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Indeed respondent Deputy Ombudsman Mojica had personal knowledge of
the facts justifying the preventive suspension of petitioner and the Provincial
Prosecutor since the acts alleged in the administrative complaint against them
were done in the course of their official transaction with the Office of the
Ombudsman.  The administrative complaint
against petitioner and Provincial Prosecutor Kintanar was filed in connection
with their designation as deputies of the ombudsman in the prosecution of a
criminal case against Mayor Rogelio Ilustrisimo.  Respondent Deputy Ombudsman did not have to go far to verify the
matters alleged in the administrative complaint to determine whether the
evidence of guilt of petitioner and Provincial Prosecutor was a strong for the
purpose of placing them under preventive suspension.</p>

<p class=BODY>Given the attitude displayed by petitioner and the Provincial
Prosecutor toward the criminal case against Mayor Rogelio Ilustrisimo, their
preventive suspension is justified to the end that the proper prosecution of
that case may not be hampered.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20' href="#_ftn20"

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> In
addition, because the charges against the two prosecutors involve grave
misconduct, insubordination and neglect of duty and these charges, if proven,
can lead to a<span style='font-size:11.0pt'> </span>dismissal from public
office, the Ombudsman was justified in ordering their preventive suspension.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS>B.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner questions her preventive suspension for six (6) months
without pay and contends that it should only be for ninety (90) days on the
basis of cases decided by this Court.  Petitioner is in error.  She is
referring to cases where the law is either silent or expressly limits the
period of suspension to ninety (90) days.  With respect to the first situation, we ruled in the case of <i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>Gonzaga v. Sandiganbayan</span></i><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21' href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><i><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'> </span></i>that -</p>

<blockquote>To the extent that there may be cases of indefinite suspension
imposed either under Section 13 of Rep. Act 3019, or Section 42 of Pres. Decree
807, it is best for the guidance of all concerned that this Court set forth the
rules on the period of preventive suspension under the aforementioned laws, as
follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  Preventive suspension under Section 13, Rep.
Act 3019 as amended shall be limited to a maximum period of ninety (90) days,
from issuances thereof, and this applies to all public officers, (as defined in
Section 2(b) of Rep. Act 3019) who are validly charged under said Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Preventive suspension under Section 42 of
Pres. Decree 807 shall apply to all officers or employees whose positions are
embraced in the Civil Service, as provided under Sections 3 and 4 of said Pres.
Decree 807, and shall be limited to a maximum period of ninety (90) days from
issuance, except where there is delay in the disposition of the case, which is
due to the fault, negligence or petition of the respondent, in which case the
period of delay shall both be counted in computing the period of suspension
herein stated; provided that if the person suspended is a presidential
appointee, the continuance of his suspension shall be for a reasonable time as
the circumstances of the case may warrant.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, petitioner and the Provincial Prosecutor were
placed under preventive suspension pursuant to §24 of the Ombudsman Act which
expressly provides that &quot;the preventive suspension shall continue until
the case is terminated by the Office of the Ombudsman but not more than six
months, without pay.&quot; Their preventive suspension for six (6) months
without pay is thus according to law.</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>C.<span style='font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Nor is there merit in petitioner's claim that the contempt charge
should first be resolved before any action in the administrative complaint case
can be taken because the contempt case involves a prejudicial question.  There is simply no basis for this
contention.  The two cases arose out of
the same act or omission and may proceed hand in hand, or one can be heard
before the other.  Whatever order is
followed will not really matter.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>the petition is DISMISSED for lack of
merit and the Motion to Lift Order of Preventive Suspension is DENIED.</p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING>CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>REGALADO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class=BODY>I concur and welcome this opportunity to make some observations
on the matter of the power of the Ombudsman to preventively suspend petitioner
for six (6) months without pay, and which petitioner assails in the case at
bar.</p>

<p class=BODY>It would, of course, be a handy expedient to just refer
petitioner to the provisions of Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770 which
expressly grants that authority to respondent Ombudsman.  Conveniently, we would merely need to remind
petitioner that for this Court to limit such authority to suspend to a lesser
period would, in effect, be constitutive of judicial legislation.  But I will go a little further by essaying
the rationale for such conferment of a more extended authority to the Ombudsman
on the issue of preventive suspension, <i>vis-a-vis</i> the provisions on
preventive suspension in other enactments, and thereby dispel lingering doubts
or misgivings thereon.</p>

<p class=BODY>It <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>is </span>true that
the Civil Service Decree allows a maximum preventive suspension of only ninety
(90) days.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
However, a comparison of the grounds therefor<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> with
those provided for in the Ombudsman Act<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> will
readily show that there is in the latter the added requirement that the
evidence of guilt is strong and the additional ground that &quot;the
respondent's continued stay in office may prejudice the case filed against
him.&quot; Further, in the aforecited Section 41 of the Civil Service Decree,
preventive suspension may be imposed on the mere simple showing that <i>the
charge involves</i> dishonesty, oppression or grave misconduct, neglect in the
performance of duty, or if there are reasons to believe that the respondent is
guilty of charges which would warrant his removal from the service:   whereas in Section 24 of Republic Act No.
6770, it is required that <i>such charges must be supported by strong evidence
of guilt</i> in order to justify preventive suspension.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the other hand, the still shorter period of sixty (60) days
prescribed in the Local Government Code of 1991<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4'
href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> as
the maximum period for the preventive suspension of local elective officials is
justifiable and deemed sufficient not only because the respondent involved is
elected by the people, but more precisely because such preventive suspension
may only be ordered &quot;after the issues are joined.&quot; That means that
before the order of suspension is issued, all the preliminary requirements and
exchanges had been completed and the respondent had already filed his
counter-affidavits to the affidavits of the complainant and the latter's
witnesses.  At that stage, the case is ready
for resolution if the parties would not opt for a formal hearing.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The preparatory procedures before such stage is reached
undoubtedly necessitate and consume a lot of time.  Yet, it will be noted that those preliminary steps are included
in the case of the period of preventive suspension ordered even before issues
are joined, as in preventive suspension by the Ombudsman pursuant to the
aforecited Section 24 of Republic Act No. 6770.  They conceivably include the service of the subpoena or order for
the respondent to file his counter-affidavits, the usual resort to motions for
extension of time to comply with the same, the improvident recourse to the
Supreme Court to suspend, annul or otherwise delay the proceedings, as well as
the filing and resolution of motions to dismiss or for a bill of particulars or
for the inhibition of the investigating officer, the denial of which motions is
often also brought all over again to this Court on petitions for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class=BODY>An illustration of how the proceedings can be delayed by such
procedural maneuvers is afforded by the case of <i>Buenaseda, et al. vs.
Flavier, et al.,</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> the
decision in which was ultimately promulgated by this Court on September 21,
1993.  The petitioners therein
questioned through repeated resourceful submissions the order of preventive
suspension issued by the Ombudsman on January 7, 1992 and it took more than
twenty (20) months before said order could eventually be reviewed on the merits
and finally sustained by the Supreme Court.<span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>That is not all.  Even
after the formal hearing is scheduled, respondents can easily resort to the
same dilatory tactics usually employed by an accused in regular court trials in
criminal actions.  Such stratagems can
obviously result in the continued occupancy by the respondent of his office
and, in the language of the law, could &quot;prejudice the case filed against
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The longer period of six (6) months for preventive suspension
under Republic Act No. 6770 was evidently induced by a desire to more
meaningfully emphasize and implement the authority of the Office of the
Ombudsman over public officials and employees in order to serve as a deterrent
against illegal, unjust, improper and inefficient conduct on their part.  As the agency mandated by the Constitution
to undertake such task, it was invested with the corresponding authority to
enable it to perform its mission.  This
intention is easily deducible from the pertinent constitutional provisions
creating said office and from the express provisions of Republic Act No. 6770.   Significantly, it is the only body authorized
to investigate even officials removable by impeachment.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>For purposes of the present case, therefore, and specifically on
the issue subject of this concurring opinion, it would be advisable to recall
what we said in <i>Buenaseda,</i> <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'>to
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;The purpose of RA No. 6770 is to give the Ombudsman such
powers as he may need to perform efficiently the task committed to him by the
Constitution.  Such being the case, said
statute, particularly its provisions dealing with procedure, should be given
such interpretation that will effectuate the purposes and objective of the
Constitution.  Any interpretation that
will hamper the work of the Ombudsman should be avoided.</blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;A statute granting powers to an agency created by the Constitution
should be liberally construed for the advancement of the purposes and
objectives for which it was created (Cf. Department of Public Utilities v.
Arkansas Louisiana Gas, Co., 200 Ark. 983, 142 S.W. [2d] 213 [1940]; Wallace v.
Feehan, 206 Ind. 522, 190 N.E. 438 [1934]).&quot;<span style='font-size:5.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>On the foregoing considerations, which are much a matter of
judicial and legislative experience, it is puerile for petitioner to impugn the
expanded authority of preventive suspension as now granted by law to the
Ombudsman.  In fact, in certain
situations, the maximum allowable period may even prove too short to subserve
the intended purpose of the law.</p>
