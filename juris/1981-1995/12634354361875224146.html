<blockquote>IN VIOLATION of and contrary to ARTICLE 294 paragraph 1 of the
Revised Penal Code."</blockquote>

prosecution in so far as it established Empacis' direct participation in the
felony charged, to wit:  the testimony
of the widow of the victim, Camila Saromines; of their son, Peter Saromines;
and of a neighbor, Balbino Bulak, which the Court found to be corroborated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">inter alia</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>by the Post Mortem Report dated September 17, 1986 of the Rural
Health Physician at Dumanjug, Cebu (Dr. Octavio Ortiz), and even by the
testimony of accused Crisologo Empacis himself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Following is the story narrated to the Trial Court by the
Government witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 9 o'clock on the night of September 16, 1986, as Fidel
Saromines and his wife, Camila, were about to close their small store, located
in their house at Kanguha, Dumanjug, Cebu, two men came and asked to buy some
sardines and rice.  They were Romualdo
(or Maldo) Langomez and Crisologo Empacis.  Camila served them and they proceeded to make a meal of the rice and
sardines.</p>

<p class="BODY">After they finished eating, Romualdo told Fidel to sell him
cigarettes.  As Fidel was handing over
the cigarettes, Romualdo announced a "hold-up" and commanded Fidel to
give up his money.  As it happened,
Fidel then had P12,000.00 in his house, wrapped in cellophane.  This he started to give to Romualdo but as
the latter was taking hold of the packet, Fidel suddenly decided to fight to
keep his money.  A struggle followed in
the course of which.  Romualdo stabbed
Fidel about three times.  Crisologo
joined in and with his own knife also stabbed Fidel.  At this time, gunshots were heard outside of the house; and a
neighbor of the Saromineses, Balbino Bulak, recognized one of those doing the
shooting as a certain Carlito Antiga.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> A
voice was heard from below saying, "Stab him!"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> to
which Langomez replied, "I already stabbed (him)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From his little sister's room, Fidel's thirteen-year old son,
Peter, saw his father fighting for his life with Romualdo and Crisologo
Empacis.  Heeding his father's cry,
"Peter, help me!" <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Suportahe ko, Peter</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">!).  </span>Peter
took hold of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">"</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">pinuti</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">" </span>(a long bolo), and rushed to his father's defense.  He struck out at Crisologo and inflicted two
wounds on him, one at the right shoulder, and the other, in the neck.  Romualdo and Crisologo jumped out of the
house and fled, with the sound of Peter's defiant shout trailing them,
"Come back, if you are brave!"</p>

<p class="BODY">Peter then turned to his wounded father, but found him already
dead from his injuries.  The post-mortem
examination conducted by Dr. Octavio Ortiz, Rural Health Physician, disclosed
four (4) stab wounds on the deceased, all in the upper back.  Two of these, which penetrated the lungs and
heart, were fatal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Crisologo Empacis repaired to the clinic of Dr. Eustaquio
Deiparine at the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">poblacion</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>of Sibonga, Cebu, for treatment of
the wounds inflicted on him by Peter, arriving there between 10 and 11 o'clock
that same night.  The doctor found
Crisologo's wounds -- ­described by him as a "(hacking) wound on the right
side of the neck and the right shoulder" -- "so serious" as to
require further treatment, even after they had been sutured.  Dr. Deiparine asked Crisologo how he had
come by these wounds.  Crisologo said
that at around 6 to 7 o'clock that evening, near the Papan Market, he was
assaulted without warning by a young man, who injured him with a bolo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Police officers came to Dr. Deiparine's clinic the following morning,
looking for a man who mght have been treated for wounds from a bladed
weapon.  They were directed to the
public market where they came upon Crisologo, taking breakfast.  They arrested him and brought him to the
Dumanjug INP Station.  There, Crisologo
was interrogated by the Station Commander, P/Pfc. Rogelio Abrea, and gave a
sworn statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Crisologo was later brought to Municipal Judge Gerardo Gestopa,
before whom he took oath on his affidavit.  Before administering the oath, the Judge had a law graduate, one Victor
Esguerra, called to assist Crisologo and verify if he had voluntarily executed
his sworn statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three (3) accused all took the witness stand in their
defense,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and gave stories different from that of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Empacis confirmed the facts established by the prosecution
witnesses, up to a point.  He admitted
that he and Romualdo Langomez had indeed gone to the store of Fidel Saromines
on the night in question, and had there partaken of a meal of sardines and
rice.  He also acknowledged that after
taking their supper, Romualdo Langomez had gone upstairs to buy some cigarettes
from Fidel, and it was there that moments later, he saw Romualdo and Fidel
grappling with each other.  He denies
having joined Romualdo in attacking Fidel.  He claims that when he saw Romualdo pull out a knife, he tried to stop
Romualdo from using the knife on his adversary; that nonetheless, Romualdo
succeeded in stabbing Fidel twice; that a teen-age boy came with a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">bolo</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>and lashed out at Romualdo but the latter was not hit because
he pulled him to one side, and instead it was he (Empacis) who was struck at
the right side of the neck; that he then ran away towards his barrio and from
there he was brought by his neighbors to the clinic of Dr. Deiparine; that he
was arrested by the police the following morning; that while being investigated
at the municipal hall of Dumanjug, he told the investigator he wished to avail
of the assistance of counsel but his request went unheeded; and that while
being interrogated, some policemen were inflicting pain on him by squeezing his
injured back in order to force him to admit his participation in the robbery-homicide
at Kanguha, Dumanjug.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other two accused, Zacarias Solis and Bebe Antiga, denied any
participation whatever in the crime.  They were both absolved by the Trial Court, which agreed with them that
the prosecution had indeed failed to clearly and positively prove their
complicity in the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court <i>a quo</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>rejected
(quite correctly, it may be said) the sworn statement purportedly executed by
Empacis on September 17, 1986, offered by the prosecution, condemning it as
"null and void, ** offensive to Art. III, Section 20, of the New
Constitution and the teachings of the Supreme Court **<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>It ruled however that the other
proofs of the prosecution overwhelmingly demonstrated Crisologo Empacis' guilt
of the crime charged, and accordingly entered a judgment of conviction against
him.  It ruled that Empacis had
committed the offense in conspiracy with Romualdo Langomez (who was then and to
this day remains at large); that both of them knew Fidel to be in possession of
a sizable amount of money at the time, and their concerted acts proved their
agreement to rob Fidel and if necessary, kill him.  It also ruled that the crime was attended by several aggravating
circumstances, i.e., having been perpetrated (a) "in the dwelling of the
offended party ** (the latter not having) given provocation,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
(b) "in the nighttime;"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> (c)
with employment of "craft or fraud;"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> and
(d) with advantage being taken of superior strength.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment Empacis has appealed to this Court.  His basic thesis is that the evidence of the
prosecution does not actually prove his guilt of the felony of which he is
accused beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking review of the record fails to reveal to this Court
any error on the part of the Trial Court of sufficient gravity to justify
reversal or modification of its verdict.  This Court is unable to perceive any reason to doubt the veracity of the
testimony of the victim's widow and son respecting the identity of Romualdo
Langomez and Crisologo Empacis as the persons who attacked and killed Fidel
Saromines in their effort to make off with the latter's money amounting to
P12,000.00, and the acts individually done by Romualdo and Crisologo in
pursuance of their common nefarious objective.  Indeed, the narrative of the widow and son is, as already pointed out,
confirmed for the most part by the testimony of Crisologo Empacis himself.  The latter's attempt to exculpate himself,
by portraying himself as a frustrated protector of Fidel Saromines, cannot be
taken at face value, as against the more credible declarations of the victim's
widow and son, specially considering that Crisologo's credit as a witness has
been gravely enfeebled by his having obviously lied to the physician treating
him, as regards the cause of his injuries.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has been cited to no plausible cause for Fidel's widow
and son to testify falsely against Crisologo if it be true, as the latter
insinuates, that either they had not seen the actual killing or, having
witnessed it, had seen Crisologo actually try to stop Romualdo from stabbing
Fidel.  No reason exists, therefore, to
disbelieve them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the victim's son, Peter, had to correct his statement on direct
examination that Romualdo Langomez stabbed his father five (5) times,
declaring, on cross-examination, that in truth Romualdo stabbed his father only
about three times while Crisologo Empacis stabbed the victim once -- of which
the appellant seeks to make capital -- is not sufficient warrant to reject and
discard Peter's evidence.  The
discrepancy is at best a minor one, not at all destructive of Peter's
credibility as an unrehearsed witness.  This Court agrees that the Trial Court has correctly assessed the credit
that should be accorded to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court also agrees that conspiracy is adequately proven by
the evidence.  Langomez and Crisologo
Empacis came to Fidel's store late at night, acting as <i>bona fide</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>customers.  Immediately after finishing their supper, they demanded the
delivery to them of Fidel's money, of which they evidently had prior knowledge,
Crisologo lending silent support to his companion's order for Fidel to turn
over the money to them; they helped each other wrest the money away from Fidel
and subdue him by deadly knife thrusts:  Romualdo stabbing Fidel thrice, Crisologo, once; they had obviously
arranged for shots to be fired from outside Fidel's store as a means of
frightening Fidel to submit to their demand; and they fled from the scene,
together.  They acted in concert,
helping and cooperating with one another (and others) by simultaneous acts,
evidently in pursuit of a common objective.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aggravating circumstance of craft or fraud<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

In the case at bar, the lateness of the hour no doubt precluded the presence of
other customers who could have deterred the felons, or come to the aid of the
victim.  All things considered, there is
adequate showing that nocturnity was deliberately sought by the robbers and did
in reality facilitate the perpetration of the felony.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the aggravating circumstance of superior strength to be
deemed present in a case, it does not suffice to prove superiority in number on
the part of the malefactors;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> it

In this case, the evidence shows that Empacis helped his co-accused by also
stabbing the victim; he and his companion took advantage of their combined
strength and their bladed weapons to overcome their unarmed victim and assure
the success of their felonious design to make off with his money.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the crime was "committed in the dwelling of the
offended party, ** the latter ** not (having) given provocation," was also
correctly appreciated as an aggravating circumstance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">This Court thus sees no cause to deviate from the established
axiom that the factual findings of the Trial Court are accorded the highest
respect on appeal, if not indeed regarded as conclusive, absent any persuasive

<p class="BODY">The Court <i>a quo</i> sentenced Crisologo Empacis to pay the
