				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These are two (2) Petitions for Review assailing the Decision of
the Court of Appeals in C.A.-G.R. No. 04652 dated 18 May 1989.  In that Decision, the Court of Appeals
affirmed the judgment of conviction rendered by the Regional Trial Court of
Malolos, Bulacan, Branch 9, in Criminal Case No. 4722-M convicting six (6)
accused of the crime of homicide.  In
G.R. No. 88392, Manuel Angelo, one of the six (6) convicted, asks us to review
the Court of Appeals Decision; in G.R. No. 89978, the other five (5) persons
convicted by the trial court similarly seek to reverse the Court of Appeals'
affirmation of that conviction.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of the Solicitor General, the Court resolved to
consolidate G.R. No. 89978 with G.R. No. 88392.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The several petitioners were among eleven (11) persons who were
charged under the following amended information:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 18th day of October 1981, in the
Municipality of Paombong, Province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused Anding Paulino, Marcelo
Bernardo, Manuel Angelo and Leonardo Layug, together with Peping Paulino,
Florencio Bautista, Danilo Leoncio, Crispin Paulino, Peping Leoncio, Pondit
Paulino and Bisaya Nakpil, who are still at large, armed with an axe and pieces
of wood and other instruments, conspiring, confederating together and mutually
helping one another did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously,
with intent to gain by means of force and violence and intimidation of persons
take, rob and carry away with them cash amounting to P20,000.00, one (1)
diamond ring worth P5,000.00 and a seiko watch valued at P500.00, belonging to
one Gavino Samaniego, to the prejudice of the said owner in the total amount of
P25,500.00; that by reason or on the occasion of the said robbery and for the
purpose of enabling them to take, rob and carry away the said money, one (1) diamond
ring and a seiko watch, with a total value of P25,500.00, the herein accused
mentioned above, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with
evident premedi­tation and treachery and taking advantage of their superior
strength, attack, assault and employ violence against the said Gavino
Samaniego, thereby inflicting upon him fatal physical injuries which directly
caused the death of the said Gavino Samaniego.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The other five (5) accused under the
above information -- i.e., Peping Paulino, Florencio Bautista, Danilo Leoncio,
Peping Leoncio and Bisaya Nakpil -- remained at large and were apparently never
arrested.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After petitioners submitted a plea of not guilty, the case went
to trial.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered its decision
convicting the six (6) petitioners herein of the crime of homicide.  The dispositive portion of this decision
reads as follows:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused, namely, Anding Paulino,
Marcelo Bernardo, Manuel Angelo, Leonardo Layug, Pondit Paulino and Crispin
Paulino GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide, and
considering that none of them appears to be disqualified from availing of the
benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, the Court hereby sentences each of
them to suffer imprisonment for not less than EIGHT (8) YEARS to SIXTEEN (16)
YEARS of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>; to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased Gavino Samaniego in the sum of P30,000.00, and to pay costs."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, that court, as already noted,
affirmed the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial court.  Hence, the present Petitions for Review.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 88392, petitioner Manuel Angelo claims that the Court
of Appeals committed the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  The Court of
Appeals seriously erred and/or acted not in accord with law and the evidence
tantamount to grave abuse of discretion in affirming the lower court's judgment
of conviction against Manuel Angelo for the crime of homicide on the basis of
inherently incredible and implausible testimonies, considering that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">A.  The
said testimonies of the principal prosecution witnesses are riddled with
contradictions and <span style="">improbabilities on
material points as to </span>create serious doubts on their credibility.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">B.  The
requirement of the lower court for the accused to first prove that the
prosecution witnesses committed perjury before their dubious testimonies can be
disregarded is manifestly contrary to law;</p>

<blockquote>2.  The Court of appeals
seriously erred and/or acted not in accord with law and the evidence tantamount
to grave abuse of discretion in disregarding the absence of an impelling motive
for Manuel Angelo to hurt or kill Gavino Samaniego, considering that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">A.  His
identification as one of those who allegedly participated in mauling the victim
is highly doubtful and unreliable for, among others, the only witness who
implicated him did not mention his alleged participation at first testimony
before the judge, and mentioned the same almost half a year later, during
reinvestigation.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">B.  Due
to such fatally defective identification, the absence of motive to commit the
crime of homicide should have been considered in favor of Manuel Angelo.</p>

<blockquote>3.  The Court of Appeals
seriously erred and/or acted not in accord with law and the evidence tantamount
to grave abuse of discretion in sustaining the lower court's finding that
conspiracy exists in the killing of Gavino Samaniego;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  The Court of Appeals
seriously erred and/or acted contrary to the Constitution in sanctioning the
lower court's finding that the non-presentation of the accused as witnesses
lessened the credibility of their defense."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">We
</span>note that the principal issues raised above relate to (a) credibility;
(b) motive; and (c) conspiracy.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 89978, the remaining five (5) petitioners submit one
issue only:</p>

<blockquote>"Can petitioners be found guilty of the crime charged beyond
reasonable doubt based merely on the testimony of Antonio Samaniego and Pat.
Reynaldo Estrella?"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In their brief, however, these
petitioners in effect adopted the assignment of errors made by petitioner
Manuel Angelo as well as his related arguments.  Thus, we treat all the petitioners as making all the arguments
indicated above and deal with them accordingly.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised before us in these Petitions for Review are
exactly the same issues petitioners had raised before the Court of
Appeals.  They ask us to review the
findings and conclusions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals relating
to the events which culminated in the death of Gavino Samaniego, insisting that
the Court of Appeals acted not in accordance with law and in effect with grave
abuse of discretion in disregarding the evidence presented and the arguments
made by petitioners' counsel before the Court of Appeals and affirming the
judgment of conviction.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is firmly settled doctrine that the findings and conclusions
of fact of the Court of Appeals are well-nigh binding upon this Court and only
questions of law may be raised in a petition for review of the decisions of
that appellate court.  It is not the
function of this Court to analyze or weigh the evidence all over again.  In effect, petitioners seek to establish
that they come within one or another of the exceptions which have developed in
case law to the mentioned general proposition.  In <u>BPI Credit Corporation v. Hon. Court of Appeals, et al</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court listed the following as exceptions:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)  When the conclusion is a finding grounded
entirely on speculation, surmises and conjectures; (2) When the inference made
is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) When there is a grave abuse
of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts;
(5) When the findings of facts are conflicting; (6) When the Court of Appeals,
in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary
to the admissions of both appellant and appellee; (7) When the findings of the
Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court; (8) When the
findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which
they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the
petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents; and
(10) When the finding of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the
supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted by the evidence on
record." (Citation omitted)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It goes without saying that very clear
and convincing evidence is essential to establish that a particular case falls
within the scope of one or more of the exceptions noted above.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As noted, the trial court found the petitioners guilty of
homicide only, and not robbery with homicide.  The trial court concluded that there was insufficient evidence
supporting the robbery portion of the special complex crime of robbery with
homicide and accordingly declined to hold them guilty of the crime of
robbery.  This is in line with the
decision of this Court in <u>People v. Pacala</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
which held that:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is well settled that in order to sustain a conviction for
the crime of robbery with homicide, it is necessary that the robbery itself be
proven as conclusively as any other essential element of a crime.  In order for the crime of robbery with
homicide to exist, it is necessary that it be clearly established that a
robbery had taken place, and that, as a consequence or on the occasion of such
robbery, a homicide be committed.  <u>Where
the evidence does not conclusively prove the robbery, the killing of the victim
would, therefore, be classified either as a simple homicide or murder,
depending upon the absence or presence of any qualifying circumstance,</u> and <u>not
the complex crime of robbery with homicide</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Accordingly, we consider below only the
conviction for homicide.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals summarized the facts it and the trial court
found:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The victim Gavino Samaniego and his brother, Domingo
Samaniego, were engaged in<b> </b>the landscaping job.  At about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of
October 18, 1981, as Gavino was riding a tricycle on his way home at Barrio San
Roque, Paombong, Bulacan, his brother Domingo saw and told him to bring to him
(Domingo) the amount of P20,000.00 to purchase materials for their landscaping
contract (TSN, pp. 2, 7-8, hearing of September 22, 1983).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At about 6:00 o'clock of the same afternoon, Antonio Samaniego, a
son of the victim Gavino Samaniego, arrived at the house of his uncle Domingo
at San Isidro, Paombong, Bulacan to protect his father from the
accused-appellants herein whom he heard from his father telling his mother that
the said accused-appellants were angry at his father.  (TSN, pp. 8-9, hearing of March 9, 1984)</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of October 18, 1981, Gavino
arrived at his brother's house, where he found his sons, Antonio and Bernardo,
as well as Ben Cuntabay.  After a short
while, Domingo's house was pelted with stones.  Gavino Samaniego, his two sons Antonio and Bernardo, including Ben
Cuntapay, came out of the house.  They
saw Marcelo Bernardo, Manuel Angelo, Leonardo Layug, Ricardo Paulino, Peping
Paulino, Peping Leoncio, Lorenzo Bautista, Bisaya Nakpil and Danilo Leoncio,
all of whom came from the nearby yard of Peping Paulino where earlier they had
a drinking spree.  (TSN, pp. 8-10,
hearing of March 4, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>These persons rushed towards Gavino Samaniego.  Manuel Angelo hit Gavino with a piece of
wood and fell on the ground face down.  Then Peping Leoncio hit Gavino on the head with an axe.  The rest of the group ganged up on the
victim, hitting the prostrate body, also with wood.  One of them picked the victim's pocket and another took his watch
and ring, both of whom were not clearly identified.  Thereafter, some of them ran towards their respective houses
leaving the others near the fallen Gavino.  (TSN, pp. 12-1, hearing of March 4, 1984).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Antonio Samaniego went to the Paombong municipal hall to seek aid
from the police.  Pat. Reynaldo Estrella
responded and proceeded to the scene.  Pat. Estrella saw and recognized Peping Paulino, Leonardo Layug, Manuel
Angelo, Peping Leoncio and Ricardo Paulino, armed with axe, dagger, piece of
wood, standing around the fallen Gavino Samaniego, lying still on the ground
(TSN, pp. 3-5, hearing of November 22, 1982).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pat. Estrella and Antonio brought Gavino to the Rosary Hospital in
Malolos, where the victim was pronounced dead on arrival.  The autopsy report (Exhibit 'A') of the
Municipal Health Officer, Dr. Alberto M. Bondoc, shows that the deceased
suffered multiple fractures of the skull, abrasions on the right forehead, left
cheek, right shoulder, chest and feet, and a lacerated wound on the scalp.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Five (5) of the eleven (11) persons implicated in the killing of
Gavino Samaniego, remained at large as of the trial of the present case.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners offer their alternative version of the background
facts surrounding the death of the victim Gavino Samaniego.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the early evening of 18 October 1981, at around 7:00 to 8:00 o'clock p.m.,
Bernardo Samaniego (brother of the victim) approached the group of petitioners
Leonardo Layug, Danilo Leoncio and Vicente Bernardo who were then sitting and
chatting at the gate of the latter's yard.  Bernardo was allegedly armed with a knife and shouted for
"Bogart," referring to petitioner Leonardo Layug.  The three (3) petitioners seeing Bernardo
Samaniego flailing away with his knife, ran away from the latter and into the
house of Vicente Bernardo, securing the door behind them.  Meanwhile, the victim Gavino Samaniego had
petitioner Peping Leoncio pinned to the ground and was about to strike the
latter with an axe ("<u>palataw</u>") when Bernardo Samaniego came
out of Vicente Bernardo's yard.  Gavino
Samaniego did not proceed to strike at petitioner Peping Leoncio; the latter
was accordingly able to flee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commotion, petitioners continue, aroused the attention of accused
Florencio Bautista and petitioner Peping Paulino and both allegedly proceeded
to chase away the victim Gavino Samaniego.  Petitioner Anding Paulino tried to follow his brother Peping, but one
Ben Cuntabay prevented him from doing so.  Anding Paulino was then called back by his wife and urged to avoid
further involvement in the commotion.  Between this point and the moment of arrival of Pat. Rey Estrella on the
scene, the precise actions of petitioners and other accused are not
satisfactorily accounted for.  Nonetheless, petitioners contend that when Pat. Rey Estrella did arrive,
Gavino Samaniego already lay on the ground, mortally injured, surrounded by
several spectators at the scene among whom were the petitioners.  In effect, petitioners contend that they
were mere spectators or curiosity-mongers at the scene of the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The familiar rule is that the assessments by trial courts of the
credibility of the witnesses who testified before them are accorded great
respect by appellate courts.  Such assessments
are not casually deviated from or reversed by higher courts who must rely
merely upon the dead print of the record before them.  In the case at bar, after careful and detailed review of the
record, we find that petitioners have not adduced adequate basis for rejecting
and reversing the basic conclusions of the trial court and of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners have expended great time and effort both before the
Court of Appeals and this Court in examining, in micro detail, the
inconsistencies and contradictions in which the two (2) principal prosecution
witnesses -- Antonio Samaniego (son of the deceased victim Gavino Samaniego)
and Pat. Rey Estrella -- supposedly involved themselves.  The bulk of the claimed inconsistencies
relate to minor points or details and do not justify disregard of the principal
thrusts of the testimony of the two (2) prosecution witnesses.  Some of the alleged inconsistencies and
contradictions are properly attributable to differences in perception by
different witnesses who react differently to the same emotional or
psychological circumstances.  The
detailed analysis given by the Solicitor General in his Consolidated Comment on
the Petitions, echoes his explanation given before the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"For instance, petitioners claimed that Antonio Samaniego
stated that he saw the incident before Pat. Estrella arrived.  Later, Antonio stated that he saw them hit
his father with pieces of wood after he fetched Pat. Estrella.</blockquote>

<blockquote>There is no inconsistency here.  Antonio never testified that he saw petitioners hit his father with the
pieces of wood only after he fetched Pat. Estrella.  Antonio declared that he saw them hit his father <u>before and
after</u> he fetched Pat. Estrella.  As
a matter of fact, when Pat. Estrella arrived, he saw some of the petitioners
still holding their weapon, and the latter threw their weapons away when they
saw Pat. Estrella approaching.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners claimed that Antonio made an incredible statement when
he stated that he saw petitioners run twice from the same incident.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Antonio never stated that he saw all the petitioners run away
together from the scene of the incident.  He explained that there were persons who ran away before he went to the
municipal building and there were others who ran away when Pat. Estrella
arrived (p. 14, tsn., March 4, 1984).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners claimed that Antonio stated that he was one hour ahead
of his father in the house of his uncle before the incident took place.  And later on, Antonio said that he stayed in
his uncle's house for about a minute only before his father arrived.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Antonio's statement that he waited for one hour before his father's
arrival was actually the words of counsel for the petitioners who asked Antonio
in cross-examination.  Antonio merely
gave a yes answer to a leading question of petitioner's counsel.  What Antonio said was that his father
arrived in his uncle's house between 7:00 and 8:00 in the evening and the
incident took place also between that period of time.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners pointed out that Antonio stated that he went to his
uncle's house to help his father in the event some trouble ensue.  However, when the people were ganging up on
his father, he immediately ran to the municipal building, without extending any
help to his father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although Antonio went to his uncle's house to help him in case of
trouble, he was, however, unable to help his father when petitioners were
already ganging upon the latter.  He
must have been shocked by the suddenness of their attack and the fact that all
petitioners were armed with deadly weapons.  As stated in the case of <u>People v. Amoncio</u>, 122 SCRA 686, 'there
is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>With regard to prosecution witness Pat. Rey G. Estrella,
petitioners likewise claimed that the said peace officer could not have focused
his eyes on them for one to three minutes since they (petitioners) ran away a
few seconds after he (Pat. Estrella) arrived.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is possible that Pat. Estrella was mistaken in his estimate of
time since the time involved is ... [too short a span].  What is important is when he arrived at the
scene of the incident, he saw petitioners throw their weapons, and then
immediately run away.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Petitioners also claimed that Pat. Estrella could not name who
among them was holding which <span style="">weapon.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It is but natural that even if Pat. Estrella saw the group of
persons armed and be able to identify them, he could not identify which weapon
each was holding because these persons precisely threw away their weapons and
then ran away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The alleged inconsistencies, therefore, are more apparent than
real.  They can easily be
explained.  Further, if any
[inconsistencies] exist, they refer only to minor details and do not affect
credibility of the witnesses, since there is no showing that the inconsistencies
were deliberate attempts to distort the truth (People v. Abigan, 144 SCRA 130;
People v. Mostales, Jr., 124 SCRA 906)."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We agree with the Court of Appeals that
the inconsistencies above addressed by the Solicitor General have not been
shown to be deliberate attempts to distort the truth and accordingly cannot be
regarded as dissolving and destroying the probative value of the witnesses’
testimony on how the victim was assaulted and killed and who were there
participating in the assault which led to the death of Gavino Samaniego.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also sought to impeach the testimony of Antonio
Samaniego on the basis of his statements found in the affidavit executed by him
during the preliminary investigation of the case.  Petitioner Manuel Angelo points out that in his affidavit,
Antonio Samaniego did not name him (Manuel Angelo) as one of those who had
taken part in the assault upon and slaying of Gavino Samaniego.  In the testimony of Antonio Samaniego in
open court, however, given five (5) months later, Manuel Angelo was explicitly
named as among the persons who rushed at Gavino Samaniego and who assaulted
Gavino with a piece of wood:</p>

(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held a number of times that variances between the
affidavit and the subsequent testimony of a witness do not by themselves affect
the credibility of the witness, considering that affidavits, which are taken <u>ex</u>
<u>parte</u> and commonly prepared by someone other than the affiant himself,
are usually incomplete and at least partially inaccurate due to suggestions or
want of suggestions and inquiries which may be necessary for the accurate
recollection of all relevant matters.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the failure of Antonio Samaniego to mention Angelo's name in Antonio's
affidavit, does not by itself show that Antonio lied in naming Manuel Angelo as
having struck his father Gavino with a piece of wood.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, assuming, for present purposes only, that part of the
testimony of a prosecution witness is actually found to be untrue, such
circumstance would not by itself be sufficient to discredit the entire
testimony of such witness.  There is no
rule of law which prohibits a court from crediting part of the testimony of a
witness as worthy of belief and from simultaneously rejecting other parts which
the court may find incredible or dubious.  The maxim <u>falsus</u> <u>in</u> <u>uno</u>, <u>falsus</u> <u>in</u> <u>omnibus</u>
is <u>not</u> a rule of law, let alone a general rule of law which is
universally applicable.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not a legal presumption either.  It is merely a latinism describing the <u>conclusion</u> reached by a
court in a <u>particular</u> case after ascribing to the evidence such weight
or lack of weight that the court deemed proper.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Next, petitioners raise as an issue the relationship of
prosecution witness Antonio Samaniego who, as noted, was a son of the deceased
victim Gavino Samaniego, as a ground for discrediting his testimony.  Petitioners imply that because of such
relationship, the testimony of Antonio Samaniego is unreliable and should be
rejected.  We are unable to agree with
this contention.  Blood relationship of
a witness to the victim in a criminal proceeding is not <u>per</u> <u>se</u> a
ground for disqualifying such witness or disregarding his testimony <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>,
absent a clear showing of some evil motive on the part of the witness
testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
On the contrary, the Court has pointed out that the underlying interest
springing from blood relationship of the witness to the victim of the crime,
would tend to secure the conviction of the guilty and prevent the implication
of innocent persons.  For the underlying
interest is an interest in seeing to it that justice is done, that the guilty
are convicted while the innocent are set free.  While revenge may be a common reaction of a person who has lost a loved
one under criminal circumstances, it does not follow that the bereaved person
would demand revenge that is directed aimlessly and mindlessly so as to include
innocent persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
On the contrary, a desire for revenge is normally satisfied only by the belief
that the person convicted was indeed <u>guilty</u> of the slaying or other
injury inflicted upon the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners next contend that they should be acquitted because
the prosecution had failed to prove any motive on their part for the killing of
Gavino Samaniego.  The established
doctrine, however, is that proof of motive of the accused to carry out the
crime charged is essential only where there is doubt as to the identity of the
doer of the deed and is not necessary where the accused has been positively
identified as among the assailants, as in the case at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
As noted earlier, Antonio Samaniego explicitly identified the petitioners as
among the people who had rushed towards Gavino Samaniego, Bernardo Samaniego,
Ben Cuntabay and himself.  Moreover,
Manuel Angelo was expressly named as having hit Gavino Samaniego with a piece
of wood with result that Gavino fell to the ground, face down.  The petitioners were similarly named by Pat.
Rey Estrella as among the group of persons who stood over the prostrate Gavino
Samaniego, some with a piece of wood, another with an axe and still another
with a dagger who threw away such weapons and fled as Pat. Estrella approached
the mortally wounded Gavino.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worthy of note that were the alternative version of the
facts presented by the defense to be given credence, petitioners would still
have to be convicted.  For the testimony
presented by the defense only showed that Gavino Samaniego was never the
aggressor:  according to the testimony
of Emma Paulino,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Gavino Samaniego stood there ready to strike petitioner Peping Leoncio with an
axe ("<u>palataw</u>") but Gavino desisted and instead, inexplicably,
ran away, with petitioners Florencio Bautista and Peping Leoncio chasing after
him.  Petitioners could not account for
their precise acts and whereabouts at the time of the commotion or melee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners seek to convince the Court that they were merely
spectators, curiously gazing upon the stricken Gavino prostrate on the
ground.  Petitioners have not, however,
satisfactorily explained why they fled from the scene of the crime as the
police arrived in the person of Pat. Estrella.  The explanation of the petitioners that they simply "[did] not wish
to be involved" is quite inadequate when taken in conjunction with the
positive identification by witness Antonio Samaniego that they had participated
in the deadly assault upon Gavino Samaniego.  The Court has repeatedly ruled that flight of an accused may be taken as
signifying awareness of guilt and consciousness that he has no viable defense
against the crime charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The final issue raised by petitioners relates to conspiracy.  Petitioners insist that conspiracy had not
been proved because no prior agreement among the petitioners to commit the
crime had been shown by the prosecution.  Once again, the well-established doctrine is that conspiracy need not be
proved by direct evidence of prior agreement to commit the crime; only rarely
would such a prior agreement be demonstrable since, in the nature of things,
criminal undertakings are only rarely documented by agreements in writing.  Thus, conspiracy may be inferred from the
conduct of the accused before, during and after the commission of the crime, showing
that the several accused had acted in concert or in unison with each other,
evincing a common purpose or design.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Once conspiracy is proven by proof of the accused having acted in concert with
one another in the commission of a crime, proof of the specific and actual
extent of participation of each of the accused becomes unnecessary; for the act
of each is imputed to the others and becomes the act of all.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the evidence of record showed that
petitioners were present at the scene of the crime just before the assault or
commotion which ended with the death of Gavino Samaniego.  Petitioners were armed with pieces of wood,
apparently branches hacked from trees growing nearby, except Peping Leoncio who
had an axe with him.  Petitioners rushed
upon the victim in concerted fashion and took turns striking and banging away
at him.  The very number and the
character of the wounds on the person of the victim indicated clearly that a
number of persons had taken part in the assault upon him, as was observed by
the Court of Appeals:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“In the instant case, the existence of conspiracy is amply shown by
the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime.  When Antonio Samaniego, Bernardo Samaniego,
Gavino Samaniego, with Ben Cuntabay, went out to the house of Domingo Samaniego
to investigate who threw stones at the roof of the house, accused-appellants
herein <u>[petitioners herein] who were armed with pieces of wood, except
Peping Leoncio who was armed with an axe, rushed towards</u> the Samaniego's
and ganged up on <u>Gavino Samaniego and they took turns in hitting him</u>.  All the accused-appellants acted in unison,
each of them hitting the victim and all participated in the assault of the
victim.  The testimony of Antonio
Samaniego elucidates how the concerted attack was perpetrated.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The findings in the autopsy report (Exhibit 'A'), indicating the
wound inflicted upon the victim Gavino Samaniego, further bolster the testimony
of Antonio Samaniego that the accused-appellants took turns in hitting the
victim.  The victim sustained abrasions
on the right forehead, left cheek, right shoulder, feet and chest over the
sixth rib.  A gaping lacerated wound was
inflicted on the scalp, occipital left.  Hematoma was visible on the right eyelids, right cheek, left ear.  The back of the head of the victim sustained
multiple fractures exposing the brain</u>, as depicted in the pictures on pages
76-80 of the records of the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The final contention of petitioners that both the trial court and
the Court of Appeals had erred seriously in taking into consideration
petitioners' failure to take the witness stand in finding them guilty of
homicide, is most appropriately and economically dealt with by quoting from the
Decision of the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"We have accorded unswerving fidelity to the constitutional
precept that an accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proven and
that, consequently, the burden of proof as to the offense charged lies on the
prosecution.  Accordingly, an accused
should be convicted on the strength of the evidence presented by the
prosecution and not on the weakness of his defense.  An accused has the right to decline to testify at the trial
without having any influence of guilt drawn from his failure to go on the
witness stand.  Thus, a verdict of
conviction on the basis, solely or mainly of the failure or refusal of the
accused to take the witness stand to deny the charges is a judicial heresy
which cannot be countenanced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As aptly pointed out by the Solicitor General, to which We place
the stamp of approval:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Such situation does not obtain, however, in the case at bar.  <u>For while the trial court took note of
the failure of the accused-appellants to take the witness stand to deny the
charge against them, the same was not the main reason, much less the sole basis
of the trial court in holding as credible the testimonies of Antonio Samaniego,
And Pat. Rey G. Estrella</u>.  The trial
court explained why it believed these witnesses.   x x x<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
