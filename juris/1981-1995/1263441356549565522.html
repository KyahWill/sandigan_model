				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn letter-complaint filed with the Office of the Court
Administrator on 17 March <span style="">1992, </span>the
complainant charged the respondent deputy sheriff of the Municipal Trial Court
in Cities (MTCC) at Cabanatuan City with the failure to enforce a writ of
demolition notwithstanding his collection and receipt of P5,200.00.  She averred that she was the plaintiff in
Civil Cases Nos. 9241 to 9249, all for ejectment, and that in a joint decision
rendered on 22 June 1987 by Branch 2 of the MTCC<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> the
defendants were ordered to vacate the premises and to surrender the possession
thereof to the complainant.  The
defendants appealed this decision to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) which in a
joint decision of 18 August 1989<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
affirmed it <i><span style="">in </span>toto</i>.  On 19 January 1990, the MTCC issued a writ
of execution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The writ was assigned to the respondent for implementation.  In view of the refusal of the defendants to
vacate the premises, the complainant asked for the issuance of a writ of
demolition, which the court granted pursuant to its order of 21 March 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
On 27 June 1990, it denied the defendant's motion for extension of time to
execute the writ of demolition.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> For
the service and implementation of the writ of demolition, the respondent asked
and received from the complainant and her lawyer the total sum of P5,200.00
purportedly as sheriff's fee.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> The
respondent issued no official receipt for this amount.  His acknowledgment of the partial payment of
P2,700.00 appears on the stationery of the complainant's lawyer, Atty. Edgardo
G. Villarin, while that for the other payment of <span style="">P500.00 </span>is handwritten on the stationery of the Office of the
City Legal Officer, who is the same Atty. Edgardo G. Villarin.  The other payment of P2,000.00 was by check
drawn by the complainant's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent did not execute the writ of demolition despite the
receipt of P5,200.00.  The complainant's
lawyer then wrote a letter to the respondent on 8 November 1990 demanding that
the latter implement the writ of demolition or return the aforesaid sum within
ten days from receipt of the letter, otherwise the matter would be brought up
to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Since nothing was done by the respondent, the complainant filed this
complaint.  She asked that the
respondent be dismissed from the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 May 1992, we required the respondent to comment on the
letter-complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment (denominated as an answer) dated 16 June 1992, the
respondent did not deny the charge that he collected P5,200.00 as sheriff's
fee; however, he specifically denied the allegation that he did not implement
the writ of execution and the writ of demolition.  He claimed that he "returned to the defendants for several
times to advice [sic] them to vacate the said place," but since they did
not, he advised the complainant's counsel to file a motion for the issuance of
a writ of demolition.  When he received
the writ of demolition, he served it on the defendants on 25 July 1990; the
latter requested an extension of thirty days.  He then prepared a return of service dated 25 July 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Then, after the expiration of the extended period, he again approached the
defendants on 4 September 1990 to make them vacate the premises.  However, he was threatened by them that if
he would enforce the writ of demolition something would happen, <i>i.e.,</i> <span style="">"<i>magkamatayan muna</i>." </span>He
then prepared the return of service on the said date.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The
writ was thus unsatisfied.  It appears,
however, that these returns dated 25 July 1990 and 4 September 1990 were filed
with the MTCC only on 29 May 1991 and 6 June 1991, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further claimed that on 8 July 1991, Judge Romeo Mauricio of
the MTCC referred to Mr. Arsenio S. Vicencio, Clerk of Court IV and Ex-Officio
Sheriff of the MTCC, the respondent's return of service of 4 September 1990 for
comment.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In his compliance of 15 July 1991,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> Mr.
Vicencio informed Judge Mauricio that the threat on the respondent's life was
"real, and it will be very risky for him to implement" it, and
requested that a new deputy sheriff be assigned to enforce the writ.  Pursuant to this request, Judge Mauricio
sent a formal request to the Presiding Judge of Branch I of the MTCC of
Cabanatuan City asking that deputy sheriff Teodoro Pineda be assigned to
implement the writ of demolition.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This case was referred to the Executive Judge of the RTC in
Cabanatuan City for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Report and Recommendation dated 4 March 1994, but
transmitted to this Court only on 6 June 1994, Executive Judge Johnson L.
Ballutay narrates the several instances that the case was set for hearing and
the postponements thereof because of the respondent's plea for time to secure
the services of counsel or because of his non-appearance.  Judge Ballutay recommends:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, and taking into account the stubborn
attitude of the respondent of not engaging the services of counsel to
facilitate the early termination of the investigation, it is respectfully
recommended that in addition to the suspension for one (1) year without pay and
to return to the complainant the P5,200.00, a suspension without pay for six
(6) months be imposed upon the respondent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of 8 August 1994, we referred the Report and
Recommendation of Judge Ballutay to the Office of the Court Administrator for
evaluation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Memorandum of 23 September 1994, the Office of the Court
Administrator finds that:</p>

<blockquote>"An exhaustive study of the evidence on record shows a
considerable amount of Neglect of Duty on the part of respondent.  He should have coordinated with the counsel
of the complainant and/or caused the citation of the defiant defendants for
contempt of court when they resisted the implementation of the writ.  Moreover, he should have requested for
additional sheriff and/or police assistance for the proper and immediate
implementation of the subject writs, but he did not.  For a long period of time, the complainants have been deprived of
their constitutional right to a speedy administration of justice considering
that the Decision sought to be enforced was issued in 1989 yet, all because of
the negligence of herein respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of Active Wood Products, Inc. vs. IAC, 183 SCRA 671,
the Court declares that sheriffs must implement or execute the decision of the
court without delay to prevent injury or damage to the winning party and so as
not to prejudice said party of obtaining speedy justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent did not also conduct himself in an upright and
professional manner as the judiciary code of ethics require [sic], particularly
in his getting the amount of P5,200.00 in installment basis from the
respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This Court, speaking through Justice Regalado, in the case of
Anonuevo vs. Pempena (Administrative Matter No. P-93-795) promulgated on July
18, 1994, enunciates:  -- ‘It is an abhorrent
and anomalous practice for a sheriff to demand fees in excess of those lawfully
allowed.  This Court has emphasized time
and again, that the conduct and behaviour of everyone connected with an office
charged with the dispensation of<span style=""> </span>justice,
from the presiding judge to the sheriff down to the lowliest clerk should be
circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Their conduct at all times, must be
characterized with propriety and decorum, but above all else, must be above and
beyond suspicion,’ for every employee should be an example of integrity,
uprightness and honesty (Valenton, et al. vs. Melgar - A.M. No. P-92-698, March
3, 1993, 219 SCRA 372)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It then recommends:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, considering all the foregoing, it is respectfully
recommended to the Honorable Court that respondent be imposed a FINE equivalent
to his one (1) month salary payable within ten (10) days upon notice, taking
into account that (a) he was not totally remiss in his duties but also exerted
efforts to execute the writs; (b) he even went to the extent of approaching the
City Mayor for relocation of the defendants; and (c) the complainant herself is
in conformity to the dismissal of the complaint; and (2) to RETURN the total
amount of P5,200.00 to the complainant, without interest, within twenty (20)
days from notice hereof, with a STERN WARNING that the repetition of similar
offense will be dealt with more severely."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the penalty recommended by Judge Ballutay or
the Office of the Court Administrator.  Both
are, especially that of the latter, grossly inadequate in the light of the
gravity of the administrative offenses committed by the respondent.  Moreover, the former's recommendation of an
additional penalty of suspension for six months on account of the
"stubborn attitude of the respondent of not engaging the services of
counsel to facilitate the early termination of the investigation" is
improper.  The records disclose that
Judge Ballutay was very accommodating to the parties.  No less than fifteen scheduled hearings were cancelled or
postponed and despite admonitions that he would proceed with the hearing
regardless of the absence of counsel, he never did.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having been delegated by this Court the authority to investigate
the case and to submit his report and recommendation, he should have, upon
deliberate failure of the respondent to engage the services of counsel, allowed
the complainant to present <i>ex-parte</i> her evidence and, upon the
non-appearance of the respondent on any of the scheduled dates of hearing,
considered him to have waived the presentation of his evidence.  As we see it then, Judge Ballutay is not
entirely without blame for the delay in the termination of the investigation of
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed that administrative cases involving
misconduct, nonfeasance, misfeasance, or malfeasance in office of officers and
employees in the judiciary are of paramount public interest as the respondents
are involved in the administration of justice, a sacred and solemn task.  Such cases must be resolved with reasonable
dispatch to clear the name of the innocent and to punish forthwith the guilty
whose stay in office, prolonged by delay, could further tarnish the image of
and diminish the public's faith in the judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot likewise give weight to the circumstances relied upon
by the Office of the Court Administrator to mitigate the respondent's
liability.  As hereinafter noted, he is
guilty of grave misconduct, gross dishonesty, serious dereliction or neglect of
duty, gross inefficiency or incompetence, and conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service.  That the
complainant "is in conformity to the dismissal of the complaint" can
by no means be considered a mitigating circumstance as it is offensive to the
postulate that a complaint for misconduct, malfeasance, or misfeasance against
a public officer or employee cannot just be withdrawn at any time by the
complainant and that the need to maintain the faith and confidence of the
people in the Government and its agencies and instrumentalities demands that
proceedings in such cases should not be made to depend on the whims and
caprices of the complainants who are, in a real sense, only witnesses therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the conformity of the complainant, found in the motion to dismiss
dated 8 February 1994<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> and
signed by the counsel for the complainant, is based on the ground that the
respondent had already "fully implemented the writ of execution."
That motion to dismiss was not, and correctly so, granted by Judge Ballutay.  On the contrary, on 4 March 1994 he made his
Report and Recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent never denied that he received the sum of P5,200.00
from the complainant in connection with the writ of demolition.  He did not issue any official receipt for
the amount received.  At the time the
writ of demolition was placed on his hands for implementation, the basic amount
that the complainant had to pay was only P8.00 pursuant to paragraph (g),
Section 7, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court.  This was later increased to P100.00 per this Court's <i><span style="">en banc</span></i><span style=""> </span>resolution of 4 September 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
There are, of course, other sheriff's expenses that prevailing parties have to
pay for the service or implementation of court processes, or the safeguarding
of property levied upon, attached or seized, including kilometrage, guard's
fees, warehousing and similar charges, in an amount to be estimated by the
sheriff.  However, the approval of the
court thereof is needed and upon such approval, the amount shall be deposited
by the interested party with the clerk of court and <i><span style="">ex-officio</span></i><span style=""> </span>sheriff,
who shall disburse the same to the deputy sheriff assigned to effect the
process, subject to liquidation within the same period for rendering a return
of the process.  Any unspent amount
shall be refunded to the party making the deposit.  A full report shall be submitted by the deputy sheriff assigned
with his return.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the respondent did not make any report on
the amount he received from the complainant nor did he issue an official
receipt therefor.  It is then obvious
that he asked for the amount not as lawful fees alone but as a consideration
for the performance of his duty.  Any
portion of the P5,200.00 then in excess of the lawful fees allowed by the Rules
of Court is an unlawful exaction which makes the respondent liable for grave
misconduct and gross dishonesty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records further disclose that the respondent's returns of
service dated 25 July 1990<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> and
24 September 1990<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> were
filed by him only on 29 May 1991 and 6 June 1991, respectively, with the MTCC,
which issued the writ of demolition.  Either the respondent correctly dated the returns, in which case there
was a deliberate and unreasonable delay in their filing with the court, or he
antedated them to make it appear that he prepared it well within the period
provided for by the Rules of Court.  Section 11 of Rule 39 thereof provides that a writ of execution should
be returned at any time not less than ten days nor more than sixty days after
its receipt by the sheriff who must set forth in writing on its back the whole
of his proceedings by virtue thereof and file it with the clerk or judge to be
preserved with the other papers in the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> As
the court personnel primarily responsible for the speedy and efficient service
of all court processes and writs originating from his court,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
it was the respondent's duty to immediately implement the writ of
demolition.  The Manual for Clerks of
Court<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"2. </span><i>Duty of sheriff as to</i> <i>execution
of process</i>. -- When a writ is placed in the hands of the sheriff, it is his
duty in the absence of instructions, to proceed with reasonable celerity and
promptness to execute it in accordance with its mandate....  He has no discretion whether to execute it
or not."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section E(4) of the Manual also provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>All
sheriffs and deputy sheriffs shall submit a report to the Judge concerned on
the action taken on all writs and processes assigned to them within ten (10)
days from receipt of said process or writ.  Said report shall form part of the records of the case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The duty imposed upon the sheriff to
execute the writ is ministerial, not directory.  A purely ministerial act or duty is one which an officer or
tribunal performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in
obedience to the mandate of the legal authority, without regard to the exercise
of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent's explanation that he was not able to implement the
writ of demolition because he was threatened with death by the defendants is
unacceptable.  If that were true, he
should have either reported it to the MTCC and requested the assistance of
other sheriffs or law enforcement authorities, or filed the appropriate
criminal complaint against the defendants who had threatened him.  Instead of doing so, he filed his returns
only after several months had lapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">For such nonfeasance and misfeasance, the respondent is guilty of
serious dereliction or neglect of duty, gross inefficiency or incompetence, and
conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Time and again, this Court has stressed that the conduct and
behavior of everyone connected with the dispensation of justice from the
presiding judge to the lowliest clerk should be circumscribed with the heavy
burden of responsibility.  They must at
all times not only observe propriety and decorum, they must also be above
suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>
