Criminal Case No. 160 (88) of the Regional Trial Court of Davao del Sur, Branch

<blockquote>"That on or about the 28th day of August, 1988, in the
Municipality of Digos, Davao del Sur, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction
of the Honorable Court, said accused, armed with stainless knife, by means of

her own house."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As is to be expected, especially in cases of this nature, the
contending parties invariably submit conflicting versions which are necessarily
addressed to judicial evaluation.  From
a careful review of the records, we find that the decision of the trial court
correctly and adequately summarizes the evidence presented by the prosecution
and the defense in support of their respective positions, hence the relevant
portions of said decision are best reproduced hereunder.</p>

<blockquote>"The version of complainant has been set forth as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 28, 1988 at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, she
was sleeping in their house together with her two children (three years old and
one year old respectively).  Her husband
at that time being a photographer, went to Dawis, for a picture taking
engagement.  While sleeping, she noticed
a weight on top of her body.  So, she
was awakened.  When she opened her eyes,
she saw a hunting knife at her bust.  A
man on top of her, said:  ‘Do not create
any noise or else, I will kill the three (3) of you.'  As she looked at his face, she recognized him to be Dante
Dabon.  Witness further identified the
accused in the courtroom.  While the accused
was pointing his knife to her, he also covered her face with a blanket.  She struggled and tried to look at him face
to face.  She was able to recognize the
accused because there was a small kerosene lamp hung on one of the posts of
their house, and at the upper portion of the place where they slept.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the accused rode on top of her, he was wearing a red
polo shirt.  On his lower extremities,
he was already completely naked.  Because of fear that she and her children will be killed, she submitted
herself and gave in to his desire.  After the accused satisfied his lustful desire, he ran out of the
house.  She was left, crying and
trembling with fear.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The victim was nineteen (19) years old at the time of the
incident, a native (Ilocana tribe) of Tulawa, Allah Vale, South Cotabato.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The victim's husband, Meliton Dionaldo, corroborated the
testimony of his wife as to his whereabouts on the said time and place.  When he arrived at about fifteen minutes
before 1:00 o'clock in the morning, he was met by his wife, crying, and
informed him about the incident.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">After the revelation from his wife, he went
down from the house and tried to search the surroundings.  At the back portion, he was able to retrieve
a knife.  When he showed it to his wife,
his wife affirmed that the same knife was used in threatening her.  Witness further found out his own jacket was
used by the accused in wiping the private part of his wife after the
intercourse.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the following day, he made a report to the police that he
knows (sic) the accused four (4) months ago prior to the date of the
incident.  On cross-examination, the
witness Mr. Dionaldo further declared that he brought the jacket and the
hunting knife to the police station but the hunting knife only was retained by
the police.  On ­re-direct examination,
he (the witness) further testified that his house is surrounded by three (3)
mercury lamps aside from the lamp which illuminates their house coming from the
concrete fence of Mr. Selma.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. Armie O. Monarca, a resident physician of the Davao del
Sur National Hospital testified that on August 29, 1988, she had examined the
complainant and found out (sic) to be negative; that she did not find anything
from the vagina; that it is very hard to determine whether there was sexual intercourse
or not since the examination was made one day after the alleged rape.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the defense version comprises the
testimonies of Ruel de Leon, Felix Maceda, Lagrimas Abalayan and the accused
himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ruel de Leon testified that he is connected with the de Leon
Gun Store, the owner of which is his father; that their business has 12 to 15
branches located in Cotabato, Zamboanga, Dipolog, Pagadian, Kidapawan, Butuan,
Cagayan de Oro, Malaybalay, Bukidnon, Iligan, Digos and General Santos City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 28, 1988, he testified that he was in Butuan City
together with his wife, Felix Maceda, Perfecto Maat and the accused, Dante
Dabon for a business transaction.  His
wife also conducted an audit in their branch office.  On the following day, August 29th, they left for General Santos
City; at about 8:00 to 9:00 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>the
evening, when they arrived at Digos, and dropped by the office to get some
papers in their branch office, they noticed that a group of persons loaded in a
jeep together with the father of the accused, arrived and picked up Dante
Dabon.  They were informed that Dante
was facing a case.  After getting the
papers in the office, they proceeded to the municipal building.  He asked the police about the case of Dante
but the policemen merely informed him that the accused is facing a case of
rape.  Right after then, their group
proceeded to General Santos City, leaving Dante Dabon in the hands of the
policemen.  The testimony of Ruel de
Leon was corroborated by Felix Maceda, who was one of the group mentioned
above.  The accused's version, as far as
his whereabouts during the said incident (is concerned) was also the same as
what the witnesses declared.  He denied
the alleged offense because he was in Butuan City together with the group when
the crime was committed; that the reason why he is being sued in this case was
probably to make money out of the family and for some personal grudges.  To prove his defense, he presented Mrs.
Lagrimas Abalayan Zamora, who testified that sometime in the last week of
September, 1988, between 5:00 o'clock to 6:00 o'clock, she visited her
half-brother Demetrio Dabon in his house.  She noticed the arrival of Mr. Dionaldo; that Mr. Dionaldo was asking
for P10,000.00 to ‘quits' the case of her nephew. <a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court below rendered judgment on June 26, 1991
finding appellant guilty of rape beyond reasonable doubt, sentencing him to
suffer "imprisonment for life or reclusion perpetua" with accessory
penalties of the law, and entitling him to a deduction in the service of his
sentence by reason of his preventive imprisonment.  The stainless knife used in the commission of the rape was
forfeited in favor of the State and the civil liability was deemed reserved.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Appellant now seeks the reversal of the aforequoted judgment,
faulting the trial court (1) for convicting him of the crime of rape for the
reason that the prosecution's evidence failed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">to </span>establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt; and (2) for not
giving credence to his defense of alibi.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Rape is a crime which is not normally committed in the presence
of witnesses, hence courts have perforce to rely on the credibility of the
complainant's testimony as weighed against the credibility of the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Prosaic as it may appear by constant repetition, we reiterate the settled rule
that the trial court's finding is generally viewed as correct and entitled to
the highest respect because it is more competent to so conclude, having seen
closely the way the witnesses testified, their deportment, and the peculiar
manner in which they gave their testimonies and other evidence in court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The defense considers this seeming variance "a great whale

<p class="BODY">The most honest witnesses may make mistakes sometimes, but such

What herein complainant stated in her affidavit and in open court constitute
but one chain of events.  Thus,
chronologically, what happened was that while she was sleeping, she noticed a
weight on top of her body and so she was awakened.  When she opened her eyes, she saw a hunting knife at her
bust.  The man on top of her, the
appellant herein, said:  "Do not
create any noise or else I will kill the three (3) of you." He then
covered her face with a blanket, but she struggled and tried to look at him
face to face.  She was able to look at
his face.  Afterwards, her shorts and
blouse were rolled down and removed by appellant in order to satisfy his
desire.  His penis then penetrated her
vagina.  The rape was thus consummated.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Applicable to this case is the jurisprudential dictum that a
young and decent Filipina who testifies that she was raped says all that is
necessary to show its commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering the inbred modesty and antipathy of a Filipina to airing in public
things that affect her honor, it is hard to conceive that the complainant would
assume and admit the ignominy she had undergone,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> and
endure the ordeal of testifying to all its shameful details, if she had not in
fact been raped.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the natural instinct, of a young, decent Filipina is to protect her
honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
It bears notice that the complainant herein is a simple housewife, nineteen
years old and an unlettered member of an ethnic tribal community.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also indisputable that appellant was positively identified
by complainant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>Her testimony as to who abused her is
credible where, as in this case, she had absolutely no motive to incriminate
and testify against appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> The
defense submits that the rape story appears to be "a conjugal concoction
to probably extract money from the family of the accused.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
With respect to this pretension, we give credit to the logical observation of
the lower court that such a theory is unbelievable since the accused is only
earning P500.00 a month as a house boy.  Furthermore, the trial court emphasizes the fact that it found no reason
at all on the part of the complainant to impute to appellant the commission of
so serious an offense which carries with it the maximum penalty, and to testify
falsely against him if it were not true.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> And
as we have likewise observed, as a rule, a victim of rape will not come out in
the open if her motive were not to obtain justice.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The defense advances the argument that the rape did not take
place because, if it did, the complainant could have shouted for assistance
from her neighbors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> It
demonstrably appears, however, that the complainant did not do so since she
thought nobody would come to her rescue considering that there was an ongoing discotheque
party at the nearby Cor Jesu College, and she further presumed that her
teacher-neighbor was already sleeping.  What she did was to sit down at the floor of the house, trembling and
crying.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Complainant's aforestated reaction and actuations at that
instance do not in any way impair her credibility.  Even among adults, different people react differently to a given
situation or type, of situation and there is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">standard form of human behavioral response when one is confronted with
a strange and startling or frightful experience.  It is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for some time the
assaults on their virtue because of the rapist's threat on their lives,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> aside from the fact that Filipinas are
naturally bashful.  Here, since
complainant was expecting her husband to arrive shortly, as he did at around
1:00 A.M., naturally it was for him that she waited and to whom she immediately
reported the </span>disgraceful assault on her chastity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also takes it against complainant's husband for reporting
the alleged rape only on the following day and for supposedly having slept
soundly even after he was informed of the alleged rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

This is a deliberate misstatement.  Properly understood, what complainant meant was that her husband slept
briefly while waiting for the morning to come so he could report the matter to
the authorities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">As to why he had to wait for the following day to report the
incident is explained by the respective testimonies of complainant and her
husband.  Complainant explained that
after she had narrated to her husband how appellant committed the felony
against her, her husband had to conduct an inspection of the premises of their
house and, after some time, he was able to recover his jacket and the knife
used by appellant,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> both
of which he presented to the police the following morning.  Meliton Dionaldo explained that he was able
to go to the police early the following day as it was already 1:00 A.M. when he
arrived at home and, after he was able to get the details of the occurrence
from his wife, he still had to conduct the aforesaid search resulting in his
recovery of the items earlier stated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was promptly reported to the police at 8:00 o'clock
the next day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
A lapse of seven (7) hours could not be considered an undue "delay."
Assuming <u>arguendo</u> that there was some time gap, it is to be borne in
mind that delay in reporting the incident is not an indication of a fabricated
charge,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

held that the lapse of the period of 35 days before the victim finally reported
the sexual abuse committed against her by accused cannot be considered
unreasonably long to render the victim's testimony doubtful.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also contends that the best evidence to show that he
really wiped his semen with the jacket of the victim's husband was the jacket
itself but, as it turned out, complainant's husband did not leave it with the
police as evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a> This
was satisfactorily explained by witness Meliton Dionaldo as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
claimed to have a jacket and you believed that it was used by the accused in
wiping himself.  Where is the jacket
now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I brought that jacket to the police station
and afterwards the police returned it to me and I brought it home.  Only this hunting knife was retained by the
police."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that complainant's husband is a photographer who
did not even finish high school.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a> He
is not a lawyer who is expected to know what evidence is material and what is
not.  Not being aware of the legal
technicalities, he cannot be expected to know what evidence to preserve and to
present.  Being guided merely by the
instructions of the police investigator, the failure to present the jacket is
not attributable to him.  Besides, the
testimonial evidence on this particular point is more than adequate to
establish that corroborative fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant further postulates that it is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>very improbable that someone would rape the complaining witness
in her house where there were bright lights nearby and holes in the house, such
that the occupants therein can be seen.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a> The
defense has perhaps forgotten that appellant made death threats on the
complainant and her children, which cowed the latter into giving in to his
bestial desire without creating a commotion.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, it is a matter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>judicial
acceptance that rape can be committed even in places where people congregate,
in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, and even inside a house
where there are other occupants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a> Lust

<p class="BODY">Veering to another angle, the defense submits that there was no
rape because there was no evidence of sexual intercourse thirty hours before
the medical examination of the complaining witness, drawing for that purpose
upon this part of the testimony of the examining physician, Dr. Armie O.
Monarca:</p>

<blockquote>"q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
were the one who placed this word ‘negative’?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,

examination?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, the defense commits another polemic distortion.  The physician did not say that there was no
sexual intercourse.  What she said was
"it could be" that complainant did not have sexual intercourse.  Obviously, the import of her statement is
that it was possible that there had been no sexual intercourse, but neither did
she rule out the possibility that there may have been sexual congress thirty
hours before the examination.  To get a
clearer perspective, it is best to have a closer look at the testimony of the
physician:</p>

<blockquote>“q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
what was (sic) your findings Mrs.  Wit­ness

negative and the sperm cell analysis was also negative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
the patient, the complainant, is already married and she has borne children.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You

<blockquote>a<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It

<p class="BODY">It is very highly improbable, if not impossible, that appellant
was indeed in Butuan City at the time of the rape.  Meliton Dionaldo, husband of complainant, established without
contradiction that when he left his house at the Estrada Compound in Digos at
around 7:30 A.M. of August 28, 1988, he met appellant in his yard.  Appellant asked him where he was going and

point:</p>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, if appellant was indeed in Butuan at the time

innocence since they were all present when appellant was arrested? They did not

in the preliminary investigation of the complaint.  It is thus clear that his alibi is an eleventh-hour contrivance

liability against the accused by way of moral, nominal, temperate or exemplary
damages, the filing fees for such civil action as provided in these Rules shall
constitute a first lien on the judgment except in an award for actual damages
