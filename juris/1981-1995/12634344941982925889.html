				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court views with grave concern the alarming incidents of
illegal recruitment which demonstrate all too clearly that overseas employment
has fast developed into a major source not only of much needed foreign exchange
but also, for the cunning and the crafty, of easy money.</p>

<p class="BODY">In response to a newspaper advertisement looking for a couple to
work as driver and tutor <i>cum</i> baby sitter, petitioners Vicente and Gloria
Manalo went to Career Planners Specialists International, Inc. (CPSI), a
licensed service contracting firm owned by private respondents, the spouses
Victor and Elnora Fernandez.  After the
requisite interview and testing, they were hired to work for a family in Saudi
Arabia for a monthly salary of US$350.00 each.  According to petitioners, a placement fee of P40,000.00 was imposed as a
precondition for the processing of their papers.  They paid only P30,000.00 in cash and executed a promissory note
for the balance.  Then they were allowed
by respondent Elnora Fernandez to sign their contract papers but did not issue
a receipt for the placement fee despite demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly before boarding their flight to Saudi Arabia, petitioners
were handed their contracts.  According
to Gloria, she was surprised to discover that her position had been changed to
that of domestic help.  However, a CPSI
employee assured her that the change was only for the purpose of facilitating
her departure and did not in anyway alter her employment as tutor.  Incidentally, CPSI provided petitioners with
the Travel Exit Pass (TEP) of Filipino Manpower Services, Inc. (FILMAN), a duly
licensed recruitment agency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the representations of her recruiter, Gloria was
actually hired as a domestic help and not as a tutor, so that after working for
only twenty-five (25) days in Jeddah, she returned to Manila.  Soon after, Vicente also resigned from his
work and followed her home.  He could
not stand the unbearable working conditions of his employment.  However, before leaving, he had to execute a
promissory note to cover his plane fare which respondent Victor Fernandez
advanced.  Vicente also had to sign a quitclaim
in favor of CPSI and his employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 February 1988, petitioners sued private respondents before
the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) charging them with
illegal exaction,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
false advertisement,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and violation of other pertinent laws, rules and regulations.  They demanded the refund of the amount
exacted from them, plus payment of moral damages and the imposition of
administrative sanctions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents countered:  (1) that Gloria applied as domestic help fully aware that she could not
be a tutor since she did not speak.  Arabic; (2) that the promissory note for P10,000.00 was required of
petitioners because they were hired without paying placement fees; (3) that it
was unlikely for petitioners, who were mature, educated and experienced in
overseas work, to part with P30,000.00 without securing a receipt; (4) that
Vicente executed a quitclaim in favor of CPSI duly authenticated by embassy
officials in Saudi Arabia; (5) that there was no impropriety in having the
employment papers of petitioners processed by FILMAN because it was a sister
company of CPSI, and private respondents Victor and Elnora were officers in
both agencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents prayed for the disqualification of
petitioners from overseas employment, and sought to recover from them the SR
1,150 plane fare advanced by Victor for Vicente, P10,000.00 as placement fee
evidenced by a promissory note, and attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mainly on the basis of the transcripts of petitioners'
testimonies in the clarificatory questioning before the Rizal Provincial
Prosecutor in a related criminal case,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the POEA issued its Order of 7 May 1990 giving more weight and credence to
petitioners' version thus -</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful evaluation of the facts and the evidence
presented, we are more inclined to give weight to complainants’ posture.  Complainants’ version of the case
spontaneously presented in their pleadings specifically during the
clarificatory questioning is, to our mind, more convincing than respondent's
stand.  Moreover, the manner by which
complainants narrated the whole incident inspired belief in the allegation that
respondent Career is indeed guilty of illegal exaction.  Thus, the actual expenses incurred by herein
complainants computed hereinbelow less the allowable fees of P3,000.00
(P1,500.00 per worker, respondent being a service contractor) should be
returned to them.</blockquote>

signed by complainant Vicente Manalo before he left for the Philippines and
presented by respondent as defense.  While its genuineness may not be in question we believe that it has no
bearing on the issue at bar.  The
aforesaid Quitclaim deals more with matters concerning complainants' employment
abroad.  However, the subject of the instant
claim is the refund of complainants' expenses <u>prior</u> to their deployment
to Saudi Arabia.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, we hold FILMAN liable for allowing its
document such as the TEP to be used by other agency.  Respondent's defense that there is nothing wrong in this because
FILMAN is a sister company of CAREER does not merit consideration because such
practice is not allowed under the POEA Rules and Regulations.  A check with our records, however, showed
that respondent FILMAN had been put in the list of forever banned agencies
effective April 5, 1989.</blockquote>

exaction is a serious charge which may cause the suspension or cancellation of

complainant that the agency charged more than the authorized fee will not
suffice to indict the agency for illegal exaction unless the allegation is
supported by other corroborative circumstantial evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed to the Secretary of Labor.  On 5 July 1991, then Undersecretary of Labor
Ma. Nieves Roldan­-Confesor (now Secretary of Labor) sustained the
reconsideration of POEA.  Her Order
reads in part -</p>

<blockquote>"We find x x x no cogent reason or sufficient justification to
reverse or modify the assailed Order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Records reveal that the only basis for holding respondent
Career Planners Specialist(s) International, Inc., liable for illegal exaction,

findings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We take this opportunity to inform the complainants that the
charge of illegal exaction is a serious charge which may cause the suspension
or cancellation of the authority or license of a recruitment agency.  Therefore, said charge must be proven and
substantiated by clear and convincing evidence.  A mere allegation will not suffice to find an agency liable for
illegal exaction unless said allegation is supported by other corroborative
circumstantial evidence.  In this
connection, records show that complainants could not narrate the specific
circumstances surrounding their alleged payment of the amount of
P30,000.00.  They could not even
remember the specific date when said amount was paid to respondent agency.  In addition, when complainants were
separately questioned as to how the money was kept bundled together prior to
being handed to respondent agency for payment, Gloria Manalo said it was
wrapped in a piece of paper while Vicente Manalo said it was placed inside an
envelope."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the charge of petitioners that they were given jobs
(driver/domestic help) different from those advertised by private respondents,
the Undersecretary ruled that there was no misrepresentation by way of false
advertisement because it was established that private respondents also caused
to be printed in the same newspaper page a second box looking for a couple
driver/domestic help.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Order of 9 October 1991, then Undersecretary Ma. Nieves
Roldan-Confesor denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present recourse, petitioners claim that public respondent
POEA committed a fatal jurisdictional error when it resolved private respondents'
motion for reconsideration in violation of Rule V, Book VI of the 1985 POEA
Rules and Regulations directing the transmittal of motions for reconsideration
to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) for determination.  Consequently, for want of legal competence
to act on said motion, the Order of 4 February 1991, as well as the subsequent
orders of public respondent Undersecretary of Labor dated 5 July 1991 and 9
October 1991, is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Aguinaldo Industries Corporation v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
We ruled -</p>

<blockquote>"To allow a litigant to assume a different posture when he
comes before the court and challenge the position he had accepted at the
administrative level, would be to sanction a procedure whereby the court --
which is supposed to <i>review</i> administrative determinations -- would not
review, but determine and decide for the first time, a question not raised at
the administrative forum.  This cannot
be permitted, for the same reason that underlies the requirement of prior exhaustion
of administrative remedies to give administrative authorities the prior
opportunity to decide controversies within its competence, and in much the same
way that, on the judicial level, issues not raised in the lower court cannot be
raised for the first time on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The alleged procedural lapse by respondent POEA was raised by
petitioners only before Us, notwithstanding that such ground was already
existing when they appealed to the Secretary of Labor.  Ironically, petitioners now question the jurisdiction
of the Secretary of Labor over the appeal which they themselves elevated to
that office.  When petitioners filed
their motion for reconsideration with the Undersecretary of Labor, this
procedural issue was not even mentioned.  Clearly, it would be the height of unfairness and inequity if We now
allow petitioners to backtrack after getting an unfavorable verdict from public
respondents whose authority they themselves invoked.  In <i>Tijam v. Sibonghanoy</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We said:  "x x x we frown upon the
‘undesirable practice’ of a party submitting his case for decision and then
accepting the judgment, only if favorable, and attacking it for lack of
jurisdiction, when adverse x x x x"</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>this regard, however, We
find no procedural infirmity constituting reversible error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1985 POEA Rules and Regulations<a style="mso-footnote-id:

is divided into eight (8) Books.  Book
VI, cited by petitioners, is entitled "Adjudication Rules".  The procedure outlined therein relates to
the original and exclusive jurisdiction exercised by POEA through its Adjudication
Department "to hear and decide all cases involving employer-employee
relations arising out of or by virtue of a law or contract involving Filipino
workers for overseas employment," including "[v]iolation of the terms
and conditions of employment x x x x [d]isputes relating to the implementation

out of employment x x x x and x x x x [v]iolations of or non-compliance with
any compromise agreement entered into by and between the parties in an overseas
employment contract".</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Book II entitled "Licensing and
Regulation" of the 1985 POEA Rules and Regulations, notably Rule VI cited
by private respondents, refers particularly to the procedure for suspension,
cancellation and revocation of Authority or License<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
through the POEA Licensing and Regulation Office (LRO).</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy in the present case centers on the liability of
private respondents for illegal exaction, false advertisement and violation of
pertinent laws and rules on recruitment of overseas workers and the resulting
imposition of penalty of suspension of the Authority of respondent CPSI.  Quite plainly, We are not concerned here
with employer-employee relations, the procedure of which is outlined in Book
VI; rather, with the suspension or revocation of Authority embodied in Book II.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, no jurisdictional error was accordingly committed
because in cases affecting suspension, revocation or cancellation of Authority,
the POEA has authority under Sec. 18, Rule VI, Book II, to resolve motions for
reconsideration which may thereafter be appealed to the Secretary of
Labor.  Section 18, provides:  "A motion for reconsideration of an
order of suspension (issued by POEA) or an appeal to the Minister (now
Secretary of Labor) from an order cancelling a license or authority may be
entertained only when filed with the LRO within ten (10) working days from the
service of the order or decision" (parenthesis supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also argue that public respondents gravely abused
their discretion when they violated petitioners' right to administrative due
process by requiring clear and convincing evidence to establish the charge of
illegal exaction.  This point is well
taken.  There was grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the administrative proceedings for cancellation, revocation or
suspension of Authority or License, no rule requires that testimonies of
complainants be corroborated by documentary evidence, if the charge of unlawful
exaction is substantially proven.  All
administrative determinations require only substantial proof and not clear and
convincing evidence as erroneously contended by public respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clear and convincing proof is "x x x more than mere
preponderance, but not to extent of such certainty as is required beyond
reasonable doubt as in criminal cases x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
while substantial evidence "x x x consists of more than a mere scintilla
of evidence but may be somewhat less than a preponderance x x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, in the hierarchy of evidentiaty values, We find proof beyond
reasonable doubt at the highest level, followed by clear and convincing
evidence, preponderance of evidence, and substantial evidence, in that order.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the administrative determination of facts may result in the
suspension or revocation of the authority of CPSI does not require a higher
degree of proof.  The proceedings are
administrative, and the consequent imposition of suspension/revocation of
Authority/License does not make the proceedings criminal.  Moreover, the sanctions are administrative
and, accordingly, their infliction does not give rise to double jeopardy when a
criminal action is instituted for the same act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus We held in <i>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development
Corporation v. Factoran, Jr.</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
-</p>

<blockquote>"x x x it is sufficient that administrative findings of fact
are supported by evidence, or negatively stated, it is sufficient that findings
of fact are not shown to be unsupported by evidence.  Substantial evidence is all that is needed to support an
administrative finding of fact, and substantial evidence is ‘such relevant evidence
as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion’ (<i>Ang
Tibay v. Court of Industrial Relations</i>, 69 Phil. 635, 642; <i>Police
Commission v. Lood</i>, 127 SCRA 762 [1984])."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The POEA, after assessing the evidence of<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp; </span>both parties, found that private respondents collected from petitioners
P30,000 as placement fees; consequently, it ruled that there was illegal
exaction.  Surprisingly, without
altering its findings of fact, POEA reconsidered its order.  It held that uncorroborated testimonies were
not enough to conclude that illegal exaction was committed, particularly so
that this might result in the suspension or revocation of respondents'
authority to engage in recruitment activities.  The premise that testimonies of petitioners should be supported by some
other form of evidence is, to say the least, fallacious.  In <i>Castillo v. Court of Appeals</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
where the appellate court reversed the findings of fact of the trial court by
requiring a higher degree of proof, We held -</p>

<blockquote>“x x x we find no strong and cogent reason which justifies the appellate
court's deviation from the findings and conclusions of the trial court.  As pointed out in Hernandez v. Intermediate
Appellate Court (189 SCRA 758 [1990]), in agrarian cases, all that is required
is mere substantial evidence.  Hence,
the agrarian court's findings of fact which went beyond the minimum evidentiary
support demanded by law, that is, supported by substantial evidence, are final
and conclusive and cannot be reversed by the appellate tribunal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The seeming discrepancy in the statements of the witnesses (one
saying the money was wrapped in paper, the other, that the money was in an
envelope; neither testified on the specific date of the exaction), refers only
to minor details.  Perhaps it would be
different if the variance refers to essential points, e.g., whether the amount
of P30,000.00 was actually paid by petitioners to private respondents.  Consequently, whether the money was wrapped
in paper, or placed in an envelope, or unwrapped, or whether the parties could
not recall when the payment was effected is unimportant.  After all, the money could have been wrapped
in paper and placed in the envelope, or placed in the envelope without being
wrapped, or wrapped with use of an unpasted envelope that appeared to be the
envelope itself.  In either case,
petitioners could have viewed them differently; but the difference is
ultimately inconsequential.  The crucial
point to consider is that the petitioners categorically and unequivocally
testified that respondents collected from them the amount of P30,000.00 as
their placement fees and that they paid the amount demanded.  In this regard, it may be worth to emphasize
that only substantial evidence, not necessarily clear and convincing evidence,
is required.  Moreover, when confronted
with conflicting assertions, the rule that "as between a positive and
categorical testimony which has a ring of truth on one hand, and a bare denial
on the other, the former is generally held to prevail x x x x"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
applies.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even on the supposition that there was no payment of
P30,000.00, it cannot be denied that private respondents required petitioners
to execute a promissory note for P10,000.00 purportedly because petitioners
were hired without paying placement fees.  The mere charging of P10,000.00, standing alone, is enough to hold
private respondents answerable for illegal exaction because the allowable
amount to be collected per contract worker according to respondent POEA was
only P1,500.00, or P3,000.00 for both petitioners.</p>

Undersecretary of Labor dated 5 July 1991 and 9 October 1991, as well as the

"Authority" is a document issued by the Minister (now Secretary of
Labor) to a private recruitment entity authorized to deploy its own workers for
its project overseas (Sec. 1, par. [d], Rule II, Book I, 1985 POEA Rules and
Regulations.  "License" is a
document issued by the Minister (now Secretary of Labor) to an agency
authorizing it to recruit and hire Filipino workers for overseas employment
(Sec. 1, par. [q], <i>Ibid</i>.  Public
respondent POEA appears to confuse Authority with License, for while POEA
refers to CPSI, a licensed service contractor, what it suspended actually was
the Authority of CPSI.</p>
