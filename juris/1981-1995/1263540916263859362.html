				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasay, Branch CX convicting defendant-appellant Antonio Alcid of the crime of rape.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the decision reads:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds herein accused Antonio Alcid GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 'Rape' as charged and hereby sentenced (sic) him to suffer imprisonment of <u>reclusion perpetua</u> and to indemnify complainant Eliza Ordon in the amount of P12,000.00, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>On April 23, 1982, complainant Eliza Ordon assisted by her mother filed two criminal complaints for rape against the defendant-appellant.&nbsp; The two criminal complaints (bearing the approval of Assistant City Fiscal Arturo B. Cruz) alleged that:<br><blockquote>"That on or about and sometime during the month of October, 1981, in Pasay City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Antonio Alcid, by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the undersigned, a twelve years old minor, against her will and consent.<br><br>"That on or about and sometime during the month of December, 1981, in Pasay City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, Antonio Alcid, by means of force, threats and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge with the undersigned, a twelve years old minor against her will and consent."</blockquote>The facts established by the prosecution and accepted by the trial court as basis for the judgment of conviction are summarized by the court as follows:<br><blockquote>"Prosecution evidence shows that herein complainant Eliza Ordon was born on July 16, 1969 (Certificate of Live Birth, Exhibit B) being the daughter of Eladio Ordon now deceased and Nilda Gapo.&nbsp; It is established that during the months of October to December, 1981, the accused who is a next-door neighbor to the complainant had sexual intercourse with the latter.&nbsp; When the first incident took place on one evening in the month of October, 1981, herein accused, godfather of complainant, requested complainant to buy viand for him for his supper.&nbsp; When complainant arrived with the purchased viand, the accused invited her to join him and his son for supper which she did.&nbsp; After supper, the accused sent his 5-year old son out of the house to watch television in the neighborhood thus leaving accused alone with complainant.&nbsp; Without much ado and under threats of death the accused had sexual intercourse with complainant.&nbsp; Complainant herein claims that her genitals bled at that time, thus indicating that before the intercourse she was a virgin and that it was the accused who deflowered her.&nbsp; Similar incidents took place in the months of October and December, 1981 on 3 separate occasions.&nbsp; It was sometime in December when the accused harmed herein complainant striking her on the head that she reported the previous four (4) circumstances of sexual abuse that she had suffered with the accused to her mother Nilda G. Ordon who took complainant to the Pasay City Police Station to complain about the incident.&nbsp; x x x"</blockquote>On April 19, 1982, Dr. Orlando V. Salvador, a Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation examined Eliza Ordon.&nbsp; The Living Case report submitted by Dr. Salvador contained the following findings:<br><blockquote>"GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:<br><br>Height:&nbsp; <u>138.8 cm.</u><br><br>Fairly developed, fairly nourished, conscious, coherent, cooperative and ambulatory subject.<br><br>Breasts, developing, small and conical.&nbsp; Areolae, 2.0 cm. in diameter, brown.&nbsp; Nipples, 0.6 cm. in diameter, brown, slightly protruding.<br><br>No extragenital physical injuries noted.<br><br>GENITAL EXAMINATION:<br><br>Pubic hairs, no growth.&nbsp; Labia majora and minora, both coaptated.&nbsp; Fourchette, tense.&nbsp; Vestibular mucose, pinkish.&nbsp; Hymen, moderately tall, thick and flabby with an old healed deep lacerations at 9:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock positions edges rounded and and non-coaptable.&nbsp; Vaginal orifice, originally annular admits tube of 2.8 cm. with moderate resistance.&nbsp; Vaginal walls, moderately tight.&nbsp; Rugosities, prominent.&nbsp; Uterus, small and firm.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS:<br><br>Genital findings present compatible with sexual intercourse with man on or about the alleged dates of commission."</blockquote>The defendant-appellant on the other hand admitted having asked the complainant to buy viand one night in October 1981 and having eaten with her and his son but denied that he had sexual intercourse with her that night or at any other time.&nbsp; Antonio Alcid testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="12%"><div align="center">"Q </div></td><td width="88%">Are you aware of the fact that you are now charged of rape on two counts?</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"A </div></td><td>Yes, sir.</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"Q </div></td><td>What can you say about these two charges against you?</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"A </div></td><td>I don't know anything about that.</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"Q </div></td><td>Do you want to tell the Court that the charges levelled against you are false or not true?</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"A</div></td><td> That is not true.</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"Q </div></td><td><p>What is now the truth?</p></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"A</div></td><td> I did not do that."</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>(T.S.N., June 16, 1983, p. 8)</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div align="center">xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"Q </div></td><td>Are you aware of the fact that . . . .

Manzano, 118 SCRA 705) and that the uncorroborated testimony of the offended party, if credible and positive, and satisfies the court beyond reasonable doubt, is sufficient to justify conviction (People v. Galicia, 123 SCRA 550).<br><br>We have carefully reviewed the records of the case and we find no reason to depart from the established rule that appellate courts will not generally disturb the findings of fact of the trial court, considering that it is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observe their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial, unless the court has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the result of the same (People v. Marzan, 128 SCRA 203).<br><br>The weak denials of the defendant-appellant cannot prevail over the clear and positive testimony of Eliza Ordon.&nbsp; With respect to the October 1981 rape, the complainant testified that:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="12%"><div align="center">"q </div></td><td width="88%">How many times did the accused have carnal knowledge with you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"a </div></td><td>4 times, Your Honor.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"q </div></td><td>When the first time that the accused abused you?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"a </div></td><td>October, 1981, sir.</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(T.S.N., August 17, 1982, p. 3).</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><div align="center">xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xxx &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><div align="center">"q </div></td><td><p>Are you ready to narrate before this Court as briefly and clearly the manner in which the accused abused you the first time in October, 1981?</p></td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"q </div></td><td>Where were you at that time?</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center"></div></td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><div align="center">"a </div></td><td>I was near the house, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">ATTY.

Alamo</u> (130 SCRA 46), we held that:<br><blockquote>"Considering the tender age of the complainant who was then only 12 years old at the time of the commission of the offense, We hold that the force employed by the accused-appellant as narrated in her testimony abovequoted was sufficient to instill fear in her, compelling her to go with him to the swamp and there submit to the lustful desires of the accused after she failed in her struggle to free and remove herself from him who held her at the waist, causing her to fall to the ground whereupon he was able to insert his penis in her private parts, thus consummating the sexual act with her.&nbsp; This Court's ruling, applied in many cases of rape, that 'it is not necessary that the force employed against the complaining woman in rape be as great or of such character as will not be resisted.&nbsp; It is sufficient that the force used is sufficient to consummate the culprit's purpose of copulating with the offended woman' (People v. Savellano, 57 SCRA 320, citing U.S. v. Villarosa, 4 Phil. 434, 437 cited in 52 C.J. 1018, note 7; Decision of Supreme Court of Spain dated May 14, 1878, 3 Viada, Codigo Penal 452; II Hidalgo Codigo Penal 302).&nbsp; The force or violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative term, depending on the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other (7 C.J.S. 475), is specifically applicable in the case at bar." x x x.</blockquote>We agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that complainant's tender age, appellant's moral ascendancy and influence over her, being her godfather (confirmation) and appellant's threat of bodily harm pervading and ever present in complainant's young mind, had practically rendered complainant meek and subservient to the appellant's needs and desires, thus becoming an easy prey to the appellant's lustful advances.<br><br>Anent the defendant-appellant's argument that Eliza waited until the fourth rape before she divulged the incident to her mother, it is sufficient to state that it is not uncommon for young girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of the rapists' threat on their lives (People v. Oydoc, 125 SCRA 250).<br><br>The defendant-appellant also questions the credibility of Eliza Ordon by pointing out that during the June 17, 1982 hearing, she did not hint that the accused threatened her if she resisted, or that the sexual intercourse was against her will, nor did she mention that she offered resistance to the advances of the accused when in fact she had the opportunity to do so, and it was only at the August 17, 1982 hearing that she testified on being threatened to be killed if she shouted for help or would tell anybody regarding the incident.<br><br>The defendant-appellant's contention is without merit.&nbsp;

(People v. Royeras, 55 SCRA 666) and that a twelve-year old girl would not tell a story of defloration and send her own "Ninong" to jail, if she was not motivated by an honest motive to have a crime against her punished.&nbsp; (See People v. Selfaison, 1 SCRA 235)<br><br>However, the lower court erred when it considered the two criminal complaints for rape filed by the complainant against the defendant-appellant as only one case.&nbsp; It should be noted that the first criminal complaint, dated April 23, 1982, alleged that sometime during the month of <u>October</u>, 1981 the defendant-appellant had carnal knowledge with the complainant through force and intimidation, and the second criminal complaint, also dated April 23, 1982, alleged that sometime during the month of <u>December</u>, 1981 the same defendant-appellant had carnal knowledge with Eliza through force and intimidation.&nbsp; The trial court should have considered these two criminal complaints for rape as separate and distinct from each other.<br><br>We have painstakingly reviewed the records of the case and we hold that the defendant-appellant's commission of the crime of rape as charged was proven beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the DECISION appealed from is AFFIRMED, with MODIFICATION that the indemnity of TWELVE THOUSAND PESOS (P12,000.00) is increased to TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20,000.00).<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Relova, De la Fuente</i>, and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Teehankee, J., (Chairman)</i>, in the result.</div>
