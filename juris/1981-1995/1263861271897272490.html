say that when the interest of justice so demands, We may interchangeably
consider petitions for review as petitions for a writ of <i>certiorari</i> and

facts in cases of review, We find no plausible reason for depriving this Court
of such power in petitions for <i>certiorari</i> specially if We consider that
in the latter cases the petitioner <span class="SpellE">oftenly</span> charges
the respondent court with the commission of grave abuse of discretion the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is noteworthy that Republic Act No.
5440 (<span class="SpellE">eff</span>., September 9, 1968) amended Section 17 of
Republic Act No. 296, otherwise known as the Judiciary Act of 1948, by
explicitly including the Court of Tax Appeals -- together with the Commission
on Elections and such quasi-judicial agencies as the Court of Industrial
Relations, the Public Service Commission and the Workmen's Compensation
Commission -- as among the entities whose final judgments and decrees were
subject to review by the Supreme Court "on <i>certiorari</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> as </span>the law or rules of court may
provide."</p>

<p class="BODY">These provisions no longer control, in view of the comprehensive
provisions of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bilang</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>129
granting to the Intermediate Appellate Court (now the Court of Appeals)
"(e)<span class="SpellE">xclusive</span> appellate jurisdiction over all
final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial

the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraphs and
subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of
1948." The fact that, as the DBP argues, the Court of Tax Appeals is not
among the agencies reorganized by said <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Batas
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Bilang</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>129,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> is of no
moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is essential, and
indisputable, is that that law did not, as the DBP imagines, deal only with
"changes in the rules on procedures;" and that not only was the Court
of Appeals <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reorganized</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

it so as to include the writ of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, </span>and

normal">whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">." </span>Its appellate jurisdiction
was also extended to cover not only final judgments of Regional Trial Courts,
but also "all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders, or awards
of ** quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, except
those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance
with the Constitution, the provisions of this Act, and of sub-paragraph (1) of
the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17
of the Judiciary Act of 1948," it being noteworthy in this connection that
the text of the law is broad and comprehensive, and the explicitly stated
exceptions have no reference whatever to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the intention to expand the original
and appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals over quasi-judicial
agencies, instrumentalities, boards, or commissions, is further stressed by the
last paragraph of Section 9 which excludes from its provisions, only the
"decisions and interlocutory orders issued under the Labor Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and by the Central Board of Assessment Appeals."</p>
