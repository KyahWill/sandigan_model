44 of Negros Occidental, Bacolod City dated October 18, 1990 which convicted

earning capacity and the sum of P10,000.00 as moral damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 8, Decision; p. 269, <u>Rollo</u>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, based mainly on the testimony of
eyewitness Rosemarie Talde, are briefly summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the early evening of October 25, 1988, Wilmar Â­Vivas arrived
at the J &amp; S Tsibugan and Snack Bar situated at corner San Sebastian and
Gatuslao Streets, Bacolod City.  Upon
seeing Rosemarie, Wilmar ordered one (1)<span style="">
</span>bottle of beer then they stayed together in one table.  Because he was curious about the place,
Rosemarie accompanied him to the second floor where there was a
sing-a-long.  Later, at around 9:30
o'clock in the evening, she left Wilmar briefly to attend to the other
customers but they did not order.  Suddenly, on her way back to Wilmar's table, she saw the appellant
pointing a gun at Wilmar then heard the appellant say:  "Tindog dira kay tiruhon ta ka, indi ka
magtindog?" ("Stand up there, I will shoot <span style="">you, </span>you will not stand up?").  Because Wilmar did <span style="">not </span>react,
she passed by the appellant and proceeded to Wilmar.  Then holding Wilmar on his right shoulder, she tried to convince
him to go downstairs.  As Wilmar stood
up from his chair, she looked at the appellant who was still pointing his gun
at Wilmar.  Then, as they were about to
step down the stairs, she heard a shot and saw the explosion coming from the
appellant's gun.  Simultaneously, Wilmar
uttered "ah" and then fell down.  Two waiters helped her bring Wilmar down the stairs but they were unable
to carry him outside because of his heavy weight.  Rosemarie went outside to shout for help and then she
collapsed.  When she regained
consciousness, she remembered what happened to Wilmar but as she was about to
stand up, she saw the appellant and his companion board a vehicle and leave.   Rosemarie went back inside the snack bar and
together with her friends, they brought Wilmar to the hospital but he was
pronounced dead on arrival <span style="">(<u>Rollo</u>,
</span>pp. 66-67).<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The medico legal officer who autopsied the body of the victim
found that the cause of Wilmar's death was shock and hemorrhage due to gunshot
wound (Tsn, August 17, 1989, p. 6).  <span style="">The </span>police investigator subsequently
recovered the appellant's clutch bag with five (5) <span style="">live </span>bullets in it and an empty shell of a .38 <span style="">caliber </span>gun at the scene of the crime
(Tsn. December 13, 1989, p. 115).</p>

<p class="BODY">Charged<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with murder, the
appellant admitted responsibility for shooting the victim Wilmar but claimed
that the shooting was purely accidental.  His version of the incident, corroborated <span style="">by </span>the testimony of his companion, Larry Pura, is as
follows:  that as sales representative
of Nestle Company, Inc., he was charged with the collection of sales, thus, he
travelled everyday and was exposed to insurgents; that because of the <span style="">nature of </span>his job, he was drafted to
be a civilian intelligence agent and was given a firearm by the Philippine
Constabulary; that in the evening of October 25, <span style="">1988, he </span>and his companion, Larry Pura, settled to eat at J
&amp; S Tsibugan and Snack Bar; that while they were eating and drinking beer,
he remembered that he left his clutch bag containing his collections in the
car; that he requested Larry to get the same and the latter complied; that
Larry noticed the appellant's gun and lifted it up from the bag; that he
impulsively grabbed the gun from Larry and it suddenly exploded; that he did
not know that Wilmar was hit; that he and Larry decided to leave the place
because the other customers scampered away; but that before going home, he
surrendered the gun to his lawyer and relayed the incident to him (<u>Rollo</u>,
pp. 68-69).</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the trial court convicted the appellant as
charged.  The trial court found that the
shooting was not by mere accident as it was intentionally and treacherously
perpetrated by the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this appeal, the
appellant assails the credibility of Rosemarie's testimony, arguing:  (1) that it is very unnatural that she put
herself in danger of being killed just to save a new acquaintance; and (2) that
it is highly incredible that Wilmar remained passive although he was held at
gunpoint and threatened to be killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted with
a shocking incident.  (People v.
Amoncio, G.R. No. 49069, June 22, 1983, 122 SCRA 686 [1983); People v. Radomes,
G.R. No. 68421, March 20, 1986, 141 SCRA 548 [1986]; People v. Catubig, G.R.
No. 89732, January 31, 1992).</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, it is difficult to ascertain the degree of
friendship existing between Rosemarie and Wilmar as would enable us to
determine how exactly she would react during the incident.  On the other hand, Wilmar's passive behavior
immediately before the incident was sufficiently explained by Rosemarie in the
following manner:</p>

his gun at Wilmar Vivas at a distance of three (3) meters, what was Wilmar
Vivas doing at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNES<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He just kept quiet, and did not make any

sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. PANDAN<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you wish to tell this Honorable Court <span style="">that </span>Wilmar Vivas did not mind the gun
pointed at him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>WITNESS<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maybe
he did not mind because he did not expect that he will be shot." (TSN, pp.
22, 71, 79, September 19, 1989, Tupas).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense of accident miserably fails.  The trial court found that the appellant
committed the crime in the manner testified to by Rosemarie.  Thus, said the court:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x [T]he manner by which the late Wilmar Vivas was
unexpectedly and abruptly shot and gunned down by the accused Victor Japsay as
to clearly quali(f)y the killing in this case to Murder was likewise
established by the prosecution's witness Rosemarie Talde and considering the
position of the late Wilmar Vivas in relation to the accused Victor Japsay
(Exh. 'E<span style="">', 'E-1', </span>to 'E-5') and
the distance between them of approximately two (2) to two and a half (2 1/2)
meters at the time that the accused fired his gun at the victim, hitting him at
the left chest, the late Wilmar Vivas was surely in no position to have
possibly been able to defend himself from the treacherous assault on his
person." (p. 7, Decision; (p. 268, <u><span style="">Rollo</span></u><span style="">)<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, treachery qualified the crime to murder.  The unarmed victim did not expect that he
would really be killed for he must have dismissed the appellant's warning as
coming from a drunken man with whom he had no quarrel anyway.  On the other hand, the herein appellant
gunned down the victim at close range while the latter was about to step down
the stairs following Rosemarie's bid to avoid trouble.  Clearly, at that particular time, the victim
was not in a position to defend himself as he was totally unprepared for the
appellant's deadly attack (People v. Pueblas, G.R. No. 32859, February 24,
1984, 127 SCRA 746, 753 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Rosemarie is a disinterested witness.  The appellant has not shown any motive sufficient to impel her to
perjure herself.  There was no reason
for Rosemarie to incriminate the appellant except to tell the truth as she had
witnessed the incident (People v. Ballinas, G.R. No. 93300, October 4, 1991).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED,
save that the amount of indemnity for death payable by the appellant Victor
Japsay to the heirs of the victim is hereby INCREASED to P50,000.00 conformably
with recent jurisprudence.</p>
