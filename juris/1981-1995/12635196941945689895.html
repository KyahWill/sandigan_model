by then fired again the second shot followed by several shots in succession.
Mario fell. His companions were stunned; they could not move. Only Jose tried

a brawl broke loose inside the club, occasioned by a fistic fight with breaking
of glasses. Proceeding from the nearby cashier’s booth where he was posted at
the time in order to pacify the protagonists, he was grabbed from behind by
someone and who took hold of his gun. They grappled together for its
possession. Not long after the gun was wrested from him, five shots were fired
in succession. His gun fired once only. The deceased fell on the floor. In the
meanwhile, both Gerry <span class="SpellE">Bustamante</span>, brother of the club
owner, and Tomas Santos, the floor manager, were by the counter.</blockquote>

was shown the fallen man. The accused likewise pointed to him the gun on the
floor beside the deceased, two and one-half feet away from the latter's hand.
Soon after, <span class="SpellE">Sobrepeña</span> followed and <span class="SpellE">Labinpuno</span> handed him the gun. Upon the advice of the police,
the accused changed into civilian clothes; thereafter, he was brought to the
police headquarters.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant raised two assignments of errors in his
appeal, namely –</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT SERIOUSLY ERRED IN <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">THE APPRECIATION </span>OF THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT SERIOUSLY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE APPELLANT FOR THE
CAPITAL OFFENSE OF MURDER.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his consolidated discussion of the above assigned errors, the
appellant uses the physical evidence and the alleged lack of motive to raise
reasonable doubts about the crime of murder having been established.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant points out:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The empty shells taken from the chambers of
his pistol were found not to have been fired from that pistol after ballistic
examination and analysis conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation
(NBI).</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is right handed. Yet, nitrates
and powder burns were found on his left hand not on his right hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The gun holster marked as exhibit by the
prosecution and admitted by the defense as the holster of the appellant's .22
caliber pistol is a holster for a right handed person. Yet, the nitrates and
powder burns were on the appellant's left hand.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remy <span class="SpellE">Eclarino</span> and
Jose Mariano, companions of Mario <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>, testified
that the appellant shot the victim. This testimony is belied by the NBI finding
that the five empty shells in the chambers of the gun were not fired from that
gun.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The prosecution failed to prove any motive
for the murder. There were customers who witnessed the shooting but the
prosecution chose to use as witnesses only the companions of the victim.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A careful consideration of the records shows that the assigned
errors have no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Remy <span class="SpellE">Eclarino</span> was less than two meters
way from Mario <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> when the appellant shot the
latter. <span class="SpellE">Eclarino</span> testified on their relative
positions at the time of the shooting and described how appellant <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>, after the first shot which downed <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>, approached the victim and fired four more times at
him while the latter was twitching (<span class="SpellE">nagkikisay</span> <span class="SpellE">kisay</span>) in the convulsions of death and while lying on the
floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose Mariano testified that their group was about to leave and
Mario <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> was the first to rise from his chair
when the appellant shot <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>. The witness was
around three meters from the assailant. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pantig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> tried </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">turn around to face the gun wielder but he
fell down. There were some more shots. Mariano could not recall the exact
number but he said, "<span class="GramE">more</span> than two" and the
shots were successive. Mariano stated that he tried to help <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>
but <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> aimed the gun at him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The two eyewitnesses positively identified the appellant as the
killer. Their testimonies on the killing appear vivid and convincing. The
evidence also indicates that the lighting system in the club at the time was
sufficient for the two witnesses to recognize the gunman and to see all that
was happening to the victim. It was then the <span class="SpellE">breaktime</span>
of the combo furnishing the dance music. There was no loud music.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the People's counsel that from the narrations given
by prosecution witnesses Remy, <span class="SpellE">Eclarin</span> and Jose
Mariano and their respective ob­servations of the shooting incident, there can
hardly be any doubt that the appellant shot the deceased Mario <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>, not accidentally, not during a strug­gle for the
possession of the appellant's gun, but intentionally. In giving their written
statements to the police, barely nine hours after the shooting in the case of <span class="SpellE">Eclarino</span> and a day after in the case of Mariano, both these
witnesses readily identified the security guard, <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>,
then detained in jail as the man who shot <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> to
death inside the <span class="SpellE">Maalikaya</span> Nightclub that early
morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clear and positive identification having been given by the
eyewitnesses regarding the participation of the accused in the crime, his
denial and explanations cannot overcome such evidence. (See People v. Chavez,
117 SCRA 221, 227)</p>

<p class="BODY">Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Munar</span>, the National Bureau bf
Investigation (NBI) ballistician, testified that the slug or evidence bullet,
which was found in the body <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the
deceased, was fired from the submitted Hi-standard Sentinel Revolver, Caliber
.22, with Serial No. <span class="GramE">B-1010.</span> The same bullet was also
testi­fied to by Dr. Labrador, who performed the autopsy on the deceased, as
having caused the fatal wound because it penetrated the left ventricle of the
heart and went through and through causing hemorrhage. Dr. Labrador's
examination also disclosed no contusions on any part of the body of the
deceased. He further concluded that the shots were fired at about four to six
meters away because of the absence of powder burns on the victim's body. These
findings belie the theory of the defense that there was a physical struggle
between the accused and the deceased for the possession of the gun and in the
course of such struggle, the gun exploded hitting the deceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that nitrates or powder burns were found on the left
hand of the accused when the holster of his gun was for a right-handed person
was also explained. While the accused did not account for the presence of
nitrates on his left hand, the NBI chief chemist, Jose K. <span class="SpellE">Ubando</span>,
under whose supervision, chemist Leticia <span class="SpellE">Manzo</span>
conducted her examination of the paraffin casts of the hands of the accused
testified that there are several factors that influence the contamination of
the hand that fires a gun. One of these is the possibility in this case that
the appellant's left hand could have gripped or clasped his right hand while
firing at the deceased in order to steady his aim. Although both <span class="SpellE">Eclarino</span> and Mariano were not definite as to how the
appellant held his gun while firing, yet they were certain that it was the
accused <span class="GramE">who</span> fired his gun successively at the
deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense attempted to discredit the two eyewitnesses by
stating that their testimonies are biased considering that they were friends of
the deceased and on the night of the killing, were the deceased's companions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find this argument untenable. The mere fact that the
eyewitnesses were friends of the deceased does not, by itself, prove that they
were prejudiced or biased in their testimonies, more so, if said testimonies
were corroborated by medical findings. We have even upheld testimonies given by
relatives notwithstanding their relationship to the deceased victims in a
number of cases. (See People v. <span class="SpellE">Puesca</span>, 87 SCRA 130;
People v. <span class="SpellE">Abujuela</span>, 92 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">SCRA </span>503; People v. Ruiz, 93 SCRA 739; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Ciria</span>, 106 SCRA 381) The rule is that where there is no
evidence, and nothing to indicate that the principal witness for the
prosecution was actuated by improper motives, the presumption is that he was
not so actuated and his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">testimony </span>is
entitled to full faith and credit. (People v. <span class="SpellE">Araja</span>,
105 SCRA 133, 145) In the case at bar, no evidence was adduced by the defense
to indicate that the eyewitnesses were prompted by any ill-motive against the
appellant. In fact, the witnesses both testified that prior to the shooting <span class="GramE">incident,</span> they did not know the appellant. The appellant, in
turn, also testified that he did not know the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that five empty shells found inside the chambers of the
appellant's gun were ascertained after ballistic examinations <u>not</u> to
have been fired by that pistol is not evidence to favor the appellant. The only
explanation is that five bullets were fired elsewhere from another gun and the
spent shells were inserted into the death weapon in order to mislead. It was
not the appellant who turned over the gun to the police immediately after the
shooting. The .22 caliber handgun was surrendered by the club's floor manager
about half an hour after the incident <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">when
</span>the police investigators started their work. What is definite is that
the fatal bullet slug taken from the body of the deceased was es­tablished by
the experts to have been fired from the appellant's gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding motive for the shooting, the appellant himself in the
statement given to the police declared that he was threatened by Mario <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> who told him "<span class="SpellE">Magingat</span>
ka, <span class="SpellE">huling</span> <span class="SpellE">araw</span> mo <span class="SpellE">na</span> <span class="SpellE">ito</span>" and later, he
allegedly overheard <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> tell his companions,
"<span class="SpellE">Mayroon</span> <span class="SpellE">akong</span> <span class="SpellE">yayariin</span> <span class="SpellE">ngayong</span> <span class="SpellE">gabi</span>." The appellant claimed that he shot <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> when he saw him reach into a pocket, thinking that <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> would draw something. At any rate, under the
circumstances of this case where eyewitnesses positively identified the
appellant as the killer and described the manner the killing was <span class="GramE">committed,</span> there is no need to establish a motive for the
killing. (People v. <span class="SpellE">Araja</span>, 105 SCRA 133)</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can the appellant capitalize on the fact that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">were </span>customers inside the nightclub
who, according to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>him, would
have been less biased had they been brought to the witness stand. The choice of
prosecution witnesses is for the fiscal to determine in the light of his
evaluation of all pertinent circumstances. The mere fact that some witnesses
were utilized and others were not, does not justify a conclusion that those who
agreed to testify did not give credible testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">If the defense believed that the other custo­mers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the nightclub could have given
enlightenment on the case and proven the innocence of the accused, it could
have availed of them, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>compulsory
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">proc</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">esses </span>of the court, to enable it to present them as its own
witnesses. (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ombao</span>, 103 SCRA 233, 241) The
defense, however, did not do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">About one hour after the shooting incident, the appellant gave an
extra-judicial statement to a police investigator wherein he owned the killing
and gave as reason the alleged threats of <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> to
kill him. The appellant does not challenge in this appeal the lower court's use
of the confession but we have examined it to ascertain compliance with Section
20 of Article IV, Bill of Rights, of the Constitution. We find from the records
that the confession was taken on <st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1971">September
 12, 1971</st1:date>. Under the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Manguerra</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
v. <span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>(63 SCRA 4) decision, the strict requirements calling for
compliance with the right to counsel amendment do not retroact to confessions
taken before the 1973 amendments. The former rules on admissibility of
extra-judicial confessions apply to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is not the slightest indication of force, intimidation, or
undue influence exerted to secure the confession. The details given in the confession
could have been furnished only by the person giving it one hour after the
shooting. The confession also tends to exculpate on grounds of self?defense.
The confession therefore, does not vitiate in any way the validity of the
decision appealed to us. As a matter of fact, the extra-judicial confession
could be completely disregarded and the judgment of conviction could still be
sustained by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>treachery
was present in the killing of <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span>. That there was
treachery is shown in the testimonies of the eyewitnesses describing the victim
as having been fired at once, at the back, then a second time as he was trying
to face his assailant, then successively when he finally fell down. He was
unarmed and totally unaware of the assailant's presence and of the fact that
the latter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>going to kill
him. When an assault is suddenly made with a deadly weapon upon an unarmed and <span class="SpellE">unexpecting</span> victim who has given no immediate provocation
for the attack, and under conditions which make it impossible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>him to evade the attack, flee, or
make defense, the act is properly qualified as treachery; and the homicide
resulting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> is murder. (<u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Pengzon</span></u>, 44 Phil. 224)</p>

<p class="BODY">We, however find, that the trial court erred in appreciating
evident premeditation as a qualifying circumstance. The supposed plan deduced
from Exhibit C is not supported by that document. The appellant indicated that
he was prepared should <span class="SpellE">Pantig</span> make good the threat to
kill him. This is not the equivalent of admitting a pre-conceived plan to shoot
the unarmed victim in cold blood.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>decision
appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED in all respects, without pronouncement as to
costs.</p>
