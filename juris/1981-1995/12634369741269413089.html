Judicial Region, Br. 44, Masbate, Masbate<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> in
Crim. Case No. 6108 where they <span style="">were </span>convicted
for the Murder of Antonio Dante.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that accused-appellants Domingo and <span style="">Jean (alias </span>Nonoy) Eustaquio, as well
as Igleceria Eustaquio and Nonong Ruado were charged with Murder in an
Information, dated August 21, 1990, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned 2nd Asst. Provincial Prosecutor accuses
Domingo Eustaquio, Igleceria Eustaquio, Nonoy Eustaquio and Nonong Ruado of San
Francisco, Calumpang, Milagros, Masbate of the crime of Murder, committed as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">That on or about May 3, 1990, in the morning thereof, at Sitio San
Francisco, Barangay Calumpang, Municipality of Milagros, Province of Masbate,
Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this court, the above-named accused,
confederating together and helping one another, with intent to kill, evident
premeditation, treachery and superiority of strength, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault, stab with a bolo and
strike with an iron bar and piece of bamboo one Antonio Dante, hitting him on
the different parts of the body, thereby inflicting wounds, which directly
caused his instantaneous death.</p>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused are related to each other.  Domingo Eustaquio and Igleceria Eustaquio are husband and
wife.  Jean (alias Nonoy) Eustaquio is
their son.  Nonong Ruado is the nephew
of Igleceria.  Except for Ruado, who
remained at large, they all pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the Information of murder against accused-appellants,
the prosecution presented two witnesses, namely: <b>ELMA FUENTES</b>, the
daughter of the deceased Antonio Dante from his first marriage and <b>AURELIA
DANTE, </b>Antonio's second wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to their testimonies, on May 2, 1990, they, together
with the deceased Antonio, went to Sitio San Francisco, to attend its fiesta
celebration.  The dance held that
evening lasted until dawn and they spent the night in the sitio.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
At 10:00 a.m., the following day, they started their trek home to Cabuyogan,
San Pablo, Mandaon, Masbate.  When they
reached the trail in front of the residence of Domingo and Igleceria Eustaquio,
Domingo called Antonio and invited him to come over to their house.  Antonio heeded the call and approached
Domingo.  Elma and Aurelia, however,
continued walking down the trail until they reached a shaded area where they
stopped to wait for Antonio.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">From their place, Elma and Aurelia saw Domingo meet the deceased
outside the Eustaquio residence.  Suddenly, Domingo brought out a bolo and hacked Antonio on the right
side of his body, and then on the back of his neck.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
other accused, Igleceria and Jean (alias Nonoy) Eustaquio, and Nonong Ruado
simultaneously attacked Antonio, hitting him on different parts of the body
with their respective weapons.  Jean
(alias Nonoy) was armed with an iron bar while Igleceria and Nonong wielded
pieces of bamboo measuring about one meter in length.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Elma

<p class="BODY">Unable to recover Antonio's body, Elma and Aurelia walked for one
hour to Cabuyogan to the house of Aurelia's brother, Ernesto Condenato.  Unfortunately, they failed to find Ernesto.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
They then rushed to the residence of the deceased's brother, Egmedio Dante in
Taisan.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With Egmedio Dante and his son, Charley, the two returned to the

<p class="BODY">The version of accused-appellants is entirely different.  Their story is that Antonio was<i> </i>killed
only by Domingo Eustaquio in defense of his wife, Igleceria.  They likewise alleged that Jean (alias Nonoy)
Eustaquio was not in sitio San Francisco at the time of the incident.  This line of defense was the subject of
testimonies by <b>DOMINGO </b>and <b>IGLECERIA EUSTAQUIO </b>and their
daughter, <b>JEANITA EUSTAQUIO.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the defense, Antonio called in on the Eustaquios at
around seven o'clock in the morning of May 3, 1990.  Domingo, Igleceria and Jeanita Eustaquio were then eating their
breakfast in their house.  Upon the
Eustaquios' invitation, the victim joined them for their morning meal.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
After breakfast, Antonio asked Igleceria -- who was the sitio treasurer -- if
he could borrow some money, so he could follow his wife to Manila.  Igleceria rejected the request.  She explained she did not have any money as
she had already turned over the proceeds of the dance to the fiesta committee
president.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Antonio left immediately, and Domingo and Jeanita went to sleep.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At around ten o'clock of the same morning, while accused
Igleceria was in the kitchen of their house preparing lunch, Antonio came
back.  He was tipsy and smelled of
liquor.  Antonio reiterated his request
for money, which Igleceria again turned down.  Antonio then grabbed Igleceria's collar and the side of her dress, and
told her in a low voice he was going to rape her.  He did not, however, make any lascivious act that would indicate
he was going to act on his threat.  The
collar and the side of the dress of Igleceria were torn when she tried’ to free
herself from Antonio's grasp.  Even
then, she did not scream for help.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The commotion awakened Jeanita.  She opened the window that separated her room from the kitchen, and saw
her mother in a kneeling position, trying to break free from Antonio who was
holding on to her dress.  Jeanita
immediately went to her father and woke him up.  They "casually" went down the stairs towards the
kitchen of their house.  When they got
there, Domingo "in a low and soft voice" asked Antonio what he was
doing to Igleceria, and requested him to release her.  Antonio angrily retorted, "Who are you?!" and freed
Igleceria.  He then boxed Domingo on the
stomach.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
At that point, Igleceria and Jeanita went up the stairs of their house and
locked themselves inside a room.  They
heard that Antonio and Domingo had brought their fight outside their
house.  They opened a window and saw Antonio
bleeding.  Allegedly, they did not see
Domingo carrying any bladed instrument, nor did they see any such weapon lying
on the ground.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
For his part, however, Domingo testified that after Antonio boxed him, he got
hold of a knife and stabbed Antonio twice in the abdomen.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although bleeding, Antonio managed to stay standing, and still
threatened the Eustaquios he would come back to kill them.  Domingo then got a piece of bamboo and hit
Antonio several times on different parts of his head and body, until he fell to
the ground dead.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Domingo then informed Igleceria and Jeanita he was going to Balud to surrender
to the authorities.  He left.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense likewise presented testimonial<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and documentary evidence to prove that <span style="">Jean
(alias<i> </i></span>Nonoy) Eustaquio was not in Sitio San Francisco, on May 3,
1990.  The documentary evidence is the
certification (Exh. "1") made by Paquito A. Adrias, Barangay Captain
of Dao, Balud, Masbate, which as translated in English, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Jean Eustaquio on May 3, 1990 at 10:00 o'clock in the
morning, Thursday, was at Barangay Dao attending the meeting and when a roll
call of the constituents of barangay Dao, Balud, Masbate was called, he was
present.  This Jean Eustaquio is farming
at Dao on the land of Antonio Arnaldo and he is staying in his own house.  We signed this certification to affirm that
on that day, he is at our barangay Dao, Balud, Masbate.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court convicted the Eustaquios for
Murder.  Domingo and Jean Eustaquio were
found guilty as principals, while Igleceria Eustaquio was convicted as an
accomplice.  They were sentenced as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, from all these premises as testified and assessed
by the court there is no doubt that the crime has been committed by all the
accused beyond reasonable doubt with Domingo Eustaquio and Jean Eustaquio
(Nonong Eustaquio) as the principals by direct participation with mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender of Domingo Eustaquio, and Igleceria
Eustaquio being just<i> </i>an accomplice will be penalized with one degree
lower after the application of the Indeterminate Sentence Law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With these findings, Jean (Nonong) Eustaquio, there being no
mitigating <span style="">circumstances in his favor

<blockquote>"As to accused Domingo Eustaquio, there being a mitigating
circumstance of voluntary surrender and after applying the Indeterminate
Sentence Law he is hereby sentenced to suffer an imprisonment of SIX (6) YEARS,
ONE (1) DAY of the minimum of <i>prision mayor</i> to TEN (10) YEARS, ONE (1)

the heirs of the victim Antonio Dante in the amount of P50,000.00 in solidum
and to pay the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As for accused Nonoy Ruado, the case as against him<i> </i>is
hereby placed in archives as he has not been brought within the jurisdiction of

will just be revived upon his arrest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Only Domingo and <span style="">Jean<i> </i></span>Eustaquio
appealed their conviction.  They now
contend:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT ACQUITTING APPELLANT JEAN

CERTAINTY OF APPELLANT'S GUILT AND TO OVERCOME THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION
OF INNOCENCE IN HIS FAVOR;" and</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We<i> </i></span>find no
merit in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first resolve the defense of alibi foisted by
accused-appellant Jean Eustaquio.  The <span style="">worn</span>-out rule is that the defense of
alibi is inherently weak.  Time and
again, <span style="">we </span>have disregarded this
defense in view of the ease with which it is concocted, and we find no reason
to give it credence in the case at bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rightly gave little weight to the certification
of the barangay captain of Dao in view of the positive identification of
accused-appellants Domingo and <span style="">Jean
(alias </span>Nonoy) Eustaquio by the two prosecution eye-witnesses as the
perpetrators of the murder of the deceased Antonio.  Witness Elma Fuentes testified:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We cannot downgrade the credibility of
Elma and Aurelia.  As daughter and wife,
respectively, of the deceased Antonio, they were genuinely interested in
prosecuting the real killers of Antonio.  They wanted justice to be done and justice will not be done if they were
to perjure themselves.  Before the
incident, they had no axe to grind against accused-appellants, hence, were
bereft of any ill-motive to implicate them falsely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, it must be noted that neither the barangay captain of
Dao, Balud, Masbate, nor any of the five (5) councilmen who signed the
certification (Exh. "1") presented by Jean (alias Nonoy) Eustaquio, testified
before the trial court on his presence in Dao on May 3, 1990.  They were not even presented to authenticate
the said document.  Hence, the trial
court ruled correctly when it rejected the said certification as devoid of any
evidentiary weight.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was also established
that the distance between Dao, Balud, Masbate and the scene of the crime could
be negotiated by a 30-minute walk.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is thus possible that said
accused-appellant Jean (alias Nonoy) Eustaquio could have left the Dao barangay
meeting (which was attended by hundreds of people) after his turn in the roll
call to commit the crime at bench.  In
fine, he was unable to establish beyond doubt the impossibility of his presence
at the scene of the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the appeal of Domingo Eustaquio.  We have no reason to disturb the trial
court’s ruling that the defense version of the killing of the victim is
incredible.  The version is incongruous
with reality.  The defense would want us
to believe that the deceased, Antonio, would suddenly attempt to rape Igleceria
Eustaquio; and then follow through on his threat, not by making lascivious acts
towards her, but by grabbing the collar <span style="">and
</span>side of her dress.  As if this
were not <span style="">enough, the defense peddled
the downright incredible reaction of accused-appellant Domingo to the alleged
attack by the deceased Antonio on Igleceria.  The defense claimed that he went "casually" to the kitchen
without arming himself </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">any way, even though he knew that Antonio was
bigger than him.  Then, according to the
testimony of Jeanita, Domingo, "in a low and soft voice," asked
Antonio what he was doing to Igleceria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To top it all, the Eustaquios claimed that Domingo
single-handedly inflicted the numerous injuries sustained by the deceased
Antonio by first stabbing him, and then finishing him off with a piece of
bamboo.  It offends common sense why a
man, who is defending the honor of his wife, would discard the bladed weapon he
had used to stab his bigger and sturdier opponent, and pick up a mere piece of
bamboo to finish off his opponent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense's story was an obvious fabrication.  It was intended to shield the other members
of the Eustaquio family from prosecution by showing that accused-appellant
Domingo alone killed the deceased.  It
was also designed to provide Domingo with a justifying circumstance for such
killing, the alleged attack on the honor of his wife, Igleceria.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that the lower court erred in imposing the penalty of six
(6) years, one (1) day of the minimum of <i><span style="">prision mayor, </span></i>to ten (10) years and one (1) day of its
maximum.  The penalty imposed by Art.
248 of the Revised <span style="">Penal Code for
Murder is </span><i><span style="">reclusion temporal </span></i><span style="">in<i> </i></span><span style="">its </span>maximum period, to death, and Art. 64(2) of the same Code,
provides that "(w)hen only a mitigating circumstance is present in the
commission of the act, they shall impose the penalty in its minimum
period." Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and considering that
accused-appellant Domingo Eustaquio has the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender to his credit, without any corresponding aggravating
circumstance, we impose on him the penalty of from ten (10) years and one (1)
day of <i><span style="">prision mayor </span></i><span style="">in<i> </i></span>its maximum period, to
seventeen (17) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i>reclusion temporal</i>
<span style="">in<i> </i></span>its maximum period.</p>
