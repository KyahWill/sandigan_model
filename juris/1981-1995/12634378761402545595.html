challenged decision are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“1.  On June 26, 1990 petitioner Garcia was
elected to the Board of Directors of the UCPB<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

later, petitioner Garcia received a letter from PCGG Chairman Gunigundo asking
him to resign from the UCPB Board in order that a replacement might be made in
his stead;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Garcia refused to resign and instead
asserted in his reply letter dated May 21, 1993 his membership in the Davao
City Chapter of the COCOFED and, therefore, his representation of the coconut
planters of Davao City;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Secretary of the UCPB;</blockquote>

PCGG Chairman Gunigundo reiterating their refusal to step down from the Board

since, according to Garcia, he had a fixed term as a director;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->6.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->In the same letter, Garcia further stated that since he and
his fellow directors were not mere agents of the PCGG, their removal would have
to be done in the manner provided by the Corporation Code, citing the case of

that purpose."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner then filed with the Sandiganbayan on 20 August
1993 a petition for prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, </i>damages and
attorney's fees with preliminary injunction and a prayer for the issuance of a
temporary restraining order<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Perceiving that the issue raised was not just the propriety of the
petitioner's separation or removal as director of the UCPB but the court's own
jurisdiction over the subject matter, the Sandiganbayan set the petition
"for hearing on 3 September 1993 on the issuance of a restraining order
with the issue of jurisdiction indicated as primordial."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
At the hearing on the said date, it expressed its concern as to "its
jurisdiction over the petition upon certain premises, namely, whether or not
the acts complained of by petitioner Garcia, which do not appear to be
factually disputed by the respondents herein, constitute merely acts of the
Board, which would make the conflict an intra­corporate problem cognizable only
by the Securities and Exchange Commission or, considering the peculiarity of
the circumstances, particularly the alleged totality of the dominance by the
PCGG over the United Coconut Planters Bank, the acts attributed to the Board of
Directors by the petitioner are acts of the PCGG under the mantle of its
special functions under Executive Orders No. 1, No. 2, No. 14 and No.
14-A." It then required the respondents to submit their "memoranda
and/or oppositions and/or answers" to the petition and the petitioner to
submit his memorandum of authorities herein, immediately after which the
petition would be deemed submitted for decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had complied with the above requirements, the
Sandiganbayan (First Division) promulgated on 1 October 1993 its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the petition because "both the allegations in the petition and
the relevant supporting annexes demonstrate that the issues presented by the
petitioner refer solely to the election or appointment of directors in a
corporation and, therefore, within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of
the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 5(c) of P.D. 902-A, as
amended." It found such issues as having "nothing to do, except very
peripherally, with the PCGG's functions of preserving property under
sequestration or of determining the ill-gotten character of propriety [sic]
already under sequestration."</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of its relevance to the proper disposition of this
petition, it is well to quote the Sandiganbayan's disquisition supporting its
judgment:</p>

<blockquote>"It is the view of this Court that the issue brought by the
petitioner to the bar is one that concerns the acts of the Board of Directors
of a corporation as such with respect to one of its members and, therefore,
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Pursuant to P.D. No. 902-A
as amended, the Securities and Exchange Commission ‘... shall have <u>original</u>
and <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 1in; text-indent: -27pt;">(c) <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Controversies in the election or
appointments of directors, trustees, officers or managers of such corporations,
partnerships or associations.’ [Sec. 5(c)].</p>

<blockquote>x x x<b><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that this Court for its part has exclusive original
jurisdiction over cases -- whether civil or criminal -- filed or prosecuted by
the PCGG does not set it in conflict with the authority of the Securities and
Exchange Commission under its own Charter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Undoubtedly, the Supreme Court has affirmed the exclusivity of this
Court's jurisdiction over cases filed by PCGG as well over the very acts of the
PCGG therein, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘… Necessarily, those who wish to question or challenge the Commission's
acts or orders in <u>such</u> <u>cases</u> must seek recourse to the same
court, the Sandiganbayan, which is vested with exclusive and original
jurisdiction …' (PCGG v. Pena, 159 SCRA 556, 564, underscoring supplied).</p>

<blockquote>The point of this, of course, is the juridical
abhorrence to split jurisdictions resulting in multiplicity of suits (id., p.
565).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Indeed, even in proceedings on issues which appeared at first blush
to have been peripheral to the PCGG's exercise of its authority, the Supreme
Court has withdrawn cases from the Regional Trial courts and even from the
Securities and Exchange Commission where it turned out that the conflict among
the parties was one '... arising from, incidental to, or related to such cases
...' i.e., the cases involving the recovery of alleged ill-gotten wealth '...
such as the dispute over the sale of shares, the propriety of the issuance of
ancillary writs of provisional remedies relative thereto, the sequestration
thereof, which may not be made the subject of separate actions or proceedings
in another forum ...' (Soriano III v. Yuzon, 164 SCRA 226, 242).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having said all of the above, however, this Court itself has also
drawn the limits of its authority to hear matters when the PCGG would somehow
be involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, this Court was upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of
Holiday Inn v. Sandiganbayan (186 SCRA 447) when it refused to look into the
propriety of a contract entered into by the New Riviera Hotel and Development
Co., Inc., which was sequestered by the PCGG and where two-thirds of the Board
of Directors were PCGG nominees.  In a
ruling that was approved of by the Supreme Court, this Court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">' "x x x.  This court
is of the view that its jurisdiction refers to acts of the PCGG acting as such whether
alone or with other persons, natural or juridical, and not generally where PCGG
representatives act as part of another juridical person or entity.  A rule of thumb might be thus:  if the PCGG can be properly impleaded on a
cause of action asserted before this Court as a distinct entity, then this
Court would generally exercise jurisdiction; otherwise, it would not, because,
then the 'PCGG character' of the act of omission in question may, at best, be
only incidental.</p>

<p class="2Q">"After all, the presence of PCGG representatives in
sequestered companies does not automatically tear down the corporate veil that
distinguishes the corporation from its officers, directors or
stockholders.  Corporate officers
whether nominated by the PCGG or not act, insofar as third parties are
concerned, are corporate officers.  Contracts entered into by the San Miguel corporation, for example, in
connection with its poultry operations and the cancellations thereof, are not
PCGG activities which would justify the invocation of this Court's
jurisdiction, even if the contract or the suit were unanimously approved by its
board of directors where PCGG representatives sit." (Resolution, Annex
'O', p. 143, Rollo).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 2pt 0.6in 2pt 7.1in; text-indent: 0in;">- Holiday Inn (Phils.),</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 2pt 0.6in 2pt 6.7in; text-indent: 0.4in;">  Inc. vs. Sandiganbayan,</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin: 2pt 0.6in 2pt 7in; text-indent: 0.1in;">  186 SCRA 447, 452’</p>

<blockquote>Going farther, the Supreme Court in that case ruled that the
Sandiganbayan would not have jurisdiction over issues which did not relate to
the propriety of the sequestration nor to the 'ill-gotten' or 'crony related'
character of the subject of the PCGG's acts.  (id. p. 453).</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the instant petition, petitioner Garcia protests the act of the
Board of Directors of the UCPB on July 22, 1993 which resulted in his ouster
from the UCPB Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is not denied that the PCGG through its Chairman had asked
petitioner Garcia to resign, Garcia had refused to do so; while PCGG Chairman
Gunigundo had written petitioner Garcia on July 6, 1993 to tell him that his
representation of the Government in the UCPB Board had been terminated,
petitioner did not there and then cease to be a member of the UCPB Board of
Directors.  Instead, it was the
Resolution (No. 66-93) of the Board of Directors at its meeting on July 22,
1993 which replaced petitioner Garcia with respondent Cesar A. Sevilla in the
Board, albeit undoubtedly upon the request or, if petitioner pleases, upon
instigation of the PCGG Chairman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent members of the Board of Directors Tirso D. Antiporda, et
al., have well pointed out that while PCGG Chairman Gunigundo had also
terminated the representation of Director Manuel Concordia, as Gunigundo indeed
had in his letter of July 6, 1993 (Annex 'C', Petition), the UCPB Board
declined to follow that lead resulting thus in the termination only of
petitioner Garcia and Wencelito T. Andanar (Annex 'F', Petition).</blockquote>

<blockquote>We then have a situation, both as a matter of law and as a matter
of fact, where an entity other than the PCGG -- the UCPB Board of Directors --
acting independently although in acquiescence to or accommodation of the behest
of the PCGG.  We, therefore, have clearly
a simple case of a Board of Directors ousting two of its members for reasons
which it had deemed proper.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Whether the Board did act properly or not in this regard has
nothing to do, except very peripherally, with the PCGG's functions of
preserving property under sequestration or of determining the ill-gotten
character of propriety [sic] already under sequestration.  In fact, both the allegations in the
petition and the relevant supporting annexes demonstrate that the issues
presented by the petitioner refer solely to the election or appointment of
directors in a corporation and, therefor[e], within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Sec. 5(c) of P.D.
902-A, as amended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">His motion for the reconsideration<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
of the decision having been denied in the resolution of the Sandiganbayan of 9
February 1994,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner then filed the instant petition.  He asks this Court to give due course to the petition and to
order the Sandiganbayan "to exercise jurisdiction over the petition for
prohibition, <i>mandamus, quo warranto, etc. </i>in the case of <i>Leon</i> <i>M.
Garcia, Jr. vs. PCGG, et al. </i>in S.B. No. 0154."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He imputes upon the Sandiganbayan the commission of the following
errors:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>X X X IN RULING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION
OVER THE PETITION FOR PROHIBITION, <i>MANDAMUS</i>, QUO WARRANTO ENTITLED LEON
M. GARCIA, JR. VS. PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT (PCGG)
PARTICULARLY IN RESOLVING THE PROPRIETY OF PETITIONER'S SEPARATION OR REMOVAL
FROM HIS POSITION.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>X X X IN NOT RULING THAT THE ACTS COMPLAINED
OF ARE DIRECT AND OVERT ACTS OF THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT
(PCGG) IN RELATION TO ITS POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF SEQUESTRATION HENCE WITHIN
THE JURISDICTION OF THE SANDIGANBAYAN.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>X X X IN RULING THAT THE REMOVAL OF
PETITIONER AS MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS BY THE PCGG AND HIS REPLACEMENT
BY THE UCPB BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS WITHIN THE ORIGINAL AND EXCLUSIVE
JURISDICTION OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioner that the Sandiganbayan has
jurisdiction over his petition because (1) "the acts complained of are
direct and overt acts of the respondent PCGG in relation to its powers and
functions of sequestration," (2) the petitioner's cause of action against
the PCGG "arose from its act of removing and directing the Board to elect
his replacement," and (3) the PCGG as the conservator of sequestered UCPB
shares of stock, directly exercised its power of sequestration of the UCPB
shares of stock." Accordingly, citing <i>"PCGG vs. Securities and
Exchange Commission, </i>G.R. No. 82188, January [should be June] 30, 1988, p.
15," and <i>"Holiday Inn vs. The Sandiganbayan, </i>186 SCRA
447," the petitioner posits the view that the Sandiganbayan has
jurisdiction over the case.  He further
contends that since the PCGG is the "real party in interest" and it
was its "act... in abruptly removing the petitioner from his position and
its urgent importunings that prompted UCPB Board of Directors to elect Cesar
Sevilla in his place," then, following <i>"PCGG vs. SEC," </i>the
SEC would have no jurisdiction over his petition since the PCGG, "as
co-equal body, is a co-equal entity over which actions the SEC has no power of
control."</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court required the parties to Comment on the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Comment filed on 14 June 1994, the private respondents
maintain that the controversy falls within the exclusive and original
jurisdiction of the SEC since it involves a protest against a corporate act to
replace a member of the Board of Directors.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment filed by the Office of the Solicitor General,
respondent PCGG submits that:</p>

<blockquote>"THE SOLE ISSUE POSED FOR RESOLUTION IS WHETHER OR NOT
RESPONDENT SANDIGANBAYAN HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE PETITION FOR PROHIBITION, <i>MANDAMUS</i>,
QUO WARRANTO, ETC. FILED BY PETITIONER."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Its arguments to support the negative of the proposition are
actually anchored not on the Sandiganbayan's lack of jurisdiction to issue the
extraordinary writs but on the fact that the petition in SB No. 0154
"essentially assails the validity of Resolution No. 66-93 of the UCPB
Board which removed petitioner as a director thereat" and "the
allegations therein have nary a bearing on the question of whether or not the
sequestered shares in UCPB are ill-gotten by the specified defendants in Civil
Case No. 0033 <i>(Republic vs. Eduardo Cojuangco, et al.) </i>pending before
respondent Sandiganbayan"; "it is thus evident that the subject
matter of the petition below refers to the corporate act of the UCPB Board and
not that of PCGG's as a public or government entity." Otherwise stated,
"the petition below is not thus <i>per se </i>a<i> </i>PCGG case,"
and in light of <i>Holiday Inn (Phils.), Inc. vs. Sandiganbayan,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>the Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over it.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court resolved to give due course to this petition and decide
it on the basis of the pleadings already submitted which sufficiently expound
the parties' respective views and positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court sees it, the larger and more crucial issue in this
case is not just the separation or removal of the petitioner as a director of
the UCPB representing the PCGG, but, as stated in the exordium of this <i>ponencia,
</i>the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan over the special civil actions of
prohibition, <i>mandamus, </i>and <i>quo warranto.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction, which is the authority to hear and the right to act
in a case,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>

Although the Sandiganbayan, a constitutionally-mandated court,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>

it has, nevertheless, only a special or limited jurisdiction.  As the Sandiganbayan puts it in the
challenged decision:</p>

<blockquote>"its jurisdiction encompasses only
those enumerated under Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606 as amended and those provided
in special laws such as R.A. No. 7080 on 'Plunder' and the enabling enactments
of Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) particularly Executive
Order No. 14 as amended (May 7, 1986), especially Secs. 1 and 2 thereof which
read:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SECTION 1.  Any provision

Executive Order No. 2, dated March 12, 1986, as may be warranted by its

<p class="BODY">It is settled that the authority to issue writs of <i>certiorari,
</i>prohibition, and <i>mandamus </i>involves the exercise of original
jurisdiction which must be expressly conferred by the Constitution or by
law.  In <i>Garcia vs. De Jesus,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>this Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"In the Philippine setting, the authority to issue Writs of <i>Certiorari</i>,
Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i> involves the exercise of original
jurisdiction.  Thus, such authority has
always been expressly conferred, either by the Constitution or by law.  As a matter of fact, the well-settled rule
is that jurisdiction is conferred only by the Constitution or by law (Orosa,
Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 76828-32, 28 January 1991; Bacalso v.
Ramolete, G.R. No. L-22488, 26 October 1967, 21 SCRA 519).  It is never derived by implication.  Indeed, '(w)hile the power to issue the writ
of <i>certiorari</i> is in some instance conferred on all courts by
constitutional or statutory provisions, ordinarily, the particular courts which
have such power are <i>expressly designated' </i>(J. Aquino's Concurring
Opinion in <i>Pimentel</i>, <i>supra, </i>citing 14 C.J.S. 202; Italics ours).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, our Courts exercise the power to issue Writs of <i>Certiorari</i>,
Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i> by virtue of express constitutional grant or
legislative enactments.  To enumerate:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitions for <i>quo warranto </i>and <i>habeas

respectively, of B.P. Blg. 129.</p>

to issue the said extraordinary writs, the Sandiganbayan, as a court with only
