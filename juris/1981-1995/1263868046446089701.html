				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rape is universally <span style="">c</span>ondemned
as a <span style="">most </span>detestable crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
He who commits it mocks and <span style="">scorns, </span>with
demented outrage, a union which Nature designs as a function of reproduction
for the perpetuation of humankind to be accomplished by a man and a woman
through full consent and mutual affection.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, consent <span style="">is the common
origin </span>of acts between man and woman, hence rape is<span style=""> </span>not presumed.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
However, once established, it must be severely and impartially punished.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This is specially true in our country where religion, tradition and culture
assign a special role to and impart high respect for the Filipina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When a Filipina publicly comes out with a
denunciation that she has been raped, she evokes admiration for her courage and
sympathy for her harrowing experience, anguish and humiliation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To her charge there is at once an aura of
truth for, unless her accusation were true, she would not lay bare her honor
and reputation to the suspicion, skepticism and malicious gossip that so often
greet public revelation of the loss of that which she holds most dear.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the alleged rapist is forthwith condemned.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, under our democratic system of Government, a mere accusation is not
synonymous with guilt.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>.
Every accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved; that
presumption is solemnly guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The contrary requires proof beyond reasonable doubt, or that degree of proof
which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Short of this, it is not only the right of the accused to be freed; it is, even
more, the constitutional duty of the court to acquit him.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since in <span style="">rape cases </span>third
party corroboration is seldom available and the victim and the assailant are
the only ones who could give a first-hand or an eye-witness account of the
questioned act,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the culpability of the offender almost invariably hinges on the story of the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the
presumption of innocence that the accused enjoys, the complainant's testimony
must perforce be carefully scrutinized and examined to satisfy the judicial
conscience that the accused did in fact commit the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Her testimony should not be received with precipitate credulity, especially
when the conviction depends at any vital point upon her uncorroborated
testimony; it should not be accepted unless her sincerity and candor are free
from suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Such testimony must be impeccable and ring true throughout,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
or credible and positive.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly, therefore, <span style="">as </span>in other
criminal cases, the evidence for the prosecution in rape cases must stand or
fall on its own merits; it cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness
of the evidence for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, it has been said that a rape charge is easy to make, hard to prove and
harder to defend by the party accused, though innocent.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused terminated the presentation of his evidence on 16
August 1989 and since the prosecuting fiscal manifested that the People had no

<p class="BODY">On 3 January 1990, the trial court promulgated its decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>

R. PIDO guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal of the crime of RAPE, and
sentencing him to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

payment of the required docket and other legal fees shall constitute a lien in
the execution of this ward.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the accused filed his Notice of Appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution upon which the conviction is
based is summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the evidence of the prosecution, the Court gathers that <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> and her family were residing in the second floor
of the house at No. 1917-B <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Extension, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
upper storey of that house had a ‘<span class="SpellE">sala</span>’ and two
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One room was occupied by Lourdes
Diaz, the owner of the house, while the other room was occupied by Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> and her family were using the ‘<span class="SpellE">sala</span>’
of the house as their sleeping quarter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 15, 1980, the deaf-mute mother and the three children of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> went to sleep at
around 9:00 o'clock in the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
husband was then in his place of work, having been assigned in the night
shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
herself retired at about 11:00 o'clock in the same evening, because she took a
bath earlier and had to dry her hair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They slept under one mosquito net, with her mother and her two year old
child on the right side of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> and her twin
children, who were four years old, on her left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sometime between 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock in the same evening, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> was awakened by an intruder, whom she identified
to be the accused, kneeling on her left side and strangling her on the neck
with his left hand while his right hand was holding a sharp bladed
instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused threatened to
kill <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> if she would shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afraid and intimidated by his threat, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> kept quiet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Afterwards the accused told her to remove her panty, which she did but
from her right foot only; her underwear remained on her left foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused placed himself on top of her, and
with his left hand inserted his penis into her genital organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
felt that the accused reached his orgasm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, he told her he would come back, went out of the mosquito net, put
on his underwear, and left through the window of the house, leaving <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> crying.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> came out of her
room to answer the call of nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
saw the accused standing in front of the window, holding something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw him passed (sic) out of the house
through the window, When Lydia switched on the light in the '<span class="SpellE">sala</span>' of their house, she saw <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
inside the mosquito net, sitting and leaning on an <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>,
shaking and crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After drinking a
glass of water given her by Lydia and after regaining her composure, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> told Lydia that she was raped by the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, although not an actual eyewitness of the sexual
assault committed by the accused against the victim, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>,
a housemate of the offended party, testified that when she came out of their
room between 1:00 and 2:00 o'clock in the morning of April 16, 1980, to answer
the call of nature, she saw <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Patinio</span> sitting inside their mosquito net, leaning on an <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>, crying, pale and shaking, and her panty removed
from one of her legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Lydia
inquired, what happened, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> answered, she was
raped by the accused, who warned her that he would return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court characterized the testimony of complainant that
accused raped her as "positive and categorical," and "clear,
positive and convincing;" concluded that the credibility of the
declaration of complainant and her witness Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>
"have not been shaken (sic) much less destroyed by the searching questions
of the cross-examiner;" and opined that the spontaneous statement of
complainant to Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> that accused raped her is
"part of the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
and consequently trustworthy because it was made under the external
circumstances of physical and mental shock, and under a stress of nervous
excitement which stilled the reflective faculties of the victim."</p>

<p class="BODY">Its <span style="">own summary </span>of
the evidence for the accused is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused, however, denied the charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While admitting that he has (sic) sexual
intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, said accused <span style="">claims </span>that their <span style="">tryst was with her consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He </span>declared that <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Teresita</span></span><span style=""> was his </span>former girl friend; that she was then only 16 years
old; that after just over a year he broke off with their relation because when
she worked in a <span style="">club </span>somewhere
in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City, she started going out with different
men; that while working in said club she <span style="">became</span>
a<span style=""> </span>prostitute; that on April 15,
1980, between 9:00 and 10:00 in the evening, he <span style="">attended </span>the <span class="SpellE">despedida</span> party of Ruben <span class="SpellE">Paparo</span>, the common-law husband of Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>,
held at their backyard; that he stayed in the party <span style="">until 12:00 </span>o'clock midnight; that he could no longer recall how
many bottles of beer he had drank, but he had drank a lot; that in the course
of their <span style="">drinking </span>spree, <span style="">he saw </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
looking out at the window and waving her hand to him, asking him to come up to
her and to pass in front of the <span style="">house; </span>that
up-stairs, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> asked him to enter their mosquito
net and even moved her <span style="">youngest </span>child
to give them more space; that they simultaneously took off their clothes and
made love; that while they were in the act, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>
<span style="">came </span>out of her room and saw
them; that she watched them before she proceeded; that both he and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> were embarrassed; that be<span style="">cause </span>of embarrassment she cried; that he dressed up and
returned to the party, passing <span style="">also </span>through
the front door; that he told <span class="SpellE">Genio</span> Santiago that they
were caught by Lydia <span class="SpellE">S<span style="">ulit</span></span><span style="">; </span>that Lydia threatened <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> that she will report to her (<span class="SpellE">Teresita's</span>)
common-law husband what she (Lydia) saw the accused <span style="">and </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> had done; that on account
of such threat, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> filed her present

increased from P25,000.00 to P30,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> argues that on the basis of the
evidence for the prosecution, it was established that accused succeeded in
having carnal knowledge with complainant through force and intimidation; he
strangled and threatened to kill her with <span style="">a

employed by accused and his threat to kill her and her children were more than
enough <span style="">to </span>force her to

As regards the statement of complainant to Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>

sexual intercourse with a stranger is <span style="">so

Even prostitutes may be raped.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In respect to credibility, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
asserts that the conclusion of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses
in rape cases carries great weight because it observed their behavior and
deportment.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
Also, <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> offer of compromise is a factor
indicating the truth of complainant's charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> argues that the
assertion of the accused that the sexual liaison was with the consent of
complainant because she was his former sweetheart is without foundation for he
offered no evidence to corroborate such claim; besides, assuming this to be so,
the relationship does not preclude rape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moral damages in rape is proper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the instant case, it should be increased to P<span style="">30,000.00 </span>in accordance with present jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue which these conflicting theories raise is whether
or not the guilt of the accused-appellant has been established beyond
reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully and meticulously reviewed and analyzed the
evidence for the prosecution in this case and, guided by the jurisprudential
principles and considerations adverted to in the exordium of this decision, We
find that the prosecution failed to discharge its duty to establish the guilt
of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reversal of the decision appealed from is inevitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution can only rely on the testimonies of the
complainant, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Patinio</span>
y <span class="SpellE">Gam</span>, and her witness, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court gave it full weight and
credit as easily suggested by the abundance of quotations, in the challenged
decision, of their testimonies on direct examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it makes reference to "lengthy,
rigid and searching cross-examination by an able and competent counsel, such
that any deliberate falsehood in their testimonies could have been easily
detected and exposed," nothing at all is mentioned as regards the <span class="SpellE">implausibilities</span>, improbabilities and inconsistencies on
substantial matters which the cross-examination revealed and exposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court merely hurried itself to the
sweeping conclusion that "the credibility of their declarations have not
been shaken much less destroyed by the searching questions of the
cross-examiner." As hereinafter shown, this is not supported by the facts
unfurled during the cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the whole, the challenged decision leaves much to be desired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find no serious effort at all to
dispassionately or impartially consider the totality of the evidence for the
prosecution in the light of the teaching in various rulings that in rape cases,
the testimony of the offended party must not be accepted with precipitate
credulity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Common sense and logic, and
above all the duty to render impartial justice, which is expected from judges,
demand that the testimonies of witnesses must be viewed in their totality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This of course means that due attention must
be given to the cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the province of the latter to test the credibility of the witnesses, expose
falsehood or half-truth, uncover the truth which rehearsed direct-examination
testimonies may successfully suppress, and demonstrate inconsistencies on
substantial matters which create reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, cross-examination is an
indispensable instrument of criminal justice to give substance and meaning to
the constitutional right of the accused to confront the witnesses against him
and to show that the presumption of innocence has remained steadfast and firm.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case then provides one more occasion for this Court to take
exception to the rule that appellate courts will generally not disturb the
factual findings of the trial court considering that it is in a better position
to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed
their deportment and manner of testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Two special considerations in this case justify <span style="">such </span>departure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly,
it was another judge (Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>) who <span style="">heard and </span>received the whole testimony
on direct examination of the complainant and the major portion of her testimony
on cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Makasiar</span>, who decided the case, did not then have
sufficient basis to form an opinion as to the complainant's deportment and
manner of testifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the
trial court had ignored or overlooked substantial facts and circumstances, as
hereafter shown, which would affect the result of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following circumstances cast serious doubts on the theory of
the prosecution that accused had carnal knowledge with complainant through
force and intimidation:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">A</p>

<p class="BODY">There is uncertainty as to the weapon allegedly used to
intimidate complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sworn
complaint describes it as a "deadly bladed instrument"; on direct
examination, complainant describes it as a "knife" (<span class="SpellE">patalim</span>).<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Yet, on cross-examination, she only said that a <u>p</u><u><span style="">ointed</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>instrument</u> which she "does not know" was pointed
on her neck, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But an intruder strangled you with his both
(sic) hands on your neck?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Only </span><span style="">his </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">lefthand</span></span><span style=""> </span>sir, <span style="">but his <span class="SpellE">righthand</span> is (sic) holding a pointed

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">No sir, he released me because something was
pointed to my neck <u>which</u> <u>I</u></span><span style=""> <u>do</u> </span><u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">know</span></u><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(Emphasis supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and on redirect examination, instead of
clarifying what the pointed weapon was in relation to the knife, what
resurfaced was not a knife but a "pointed object," thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let us come (sic) back to the scene where
you were threatened by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
stated on cross-examination that his <span class="SpellE">lefthand</span> was
holding your neck while his <span class="SpellE">righthand</span> was holding a <u>po</u><u><span style="">inted</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>object</u> and pointed <span style="">to
</span>your neck, do you remember that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he threatened you that you should hold
his penis and place it in your vagina where was the <u>pointed</u> <u>object</u>
pointed to you at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(WITNESS POINTING ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HER
NECK)."<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was filed on 22 May 1981 after the complainant had
executed an affidavit and a preliminary investigation was conducted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If indeed accused used a weapon to intimidate
complainant and the latter saw it and there was no doubt at all that it was a
knife, there was no reason why the complainant should only describe it as a
"deadly bladed instrument" <span style="">in
</span><span style="">her </span>sworn complaint and
then merely as a "pointed instrument" on cross-examination, which the
prosecution did not even try to rectify on redirect examination.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">B</p>

<p class="BODY">In her sworn complaint, complainant categorically asserted that
accused ordered her "to remove her entire <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>,"
yet in her direct testimony, she was merely told to remove her panty, which she
did not fully comply with because it was removed from the right leg only, and
remained with the left leg.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, she reiterated this and even quoted the alleged
instructions of the accused.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">C</p>

<p class="BODY">On direct examination, complainant testified that when she woke
up because the accused strangled her, the latter was kneeling on her left side
near her twins;<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">yet, on cross examination, </span>she
declared that her body was in between his legs thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When you woke up, according to you, the
accused was strangling you, what was the position of the accused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I woke up he had my body in between his
both (sic) legs and with the hand placed on my neck in a strangle hold and he
had a knife on his right hand."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">D</p>

<p class="BODY">By a direct, positive and unequivocal statement, complainant
categorically asserted on direct examination that:</p>

<blockquote>"When he [accused] was on top of me, <u>he</u> <u>inserted</u>
<u><span style="">his</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>private</u> <u>o</u><u><span style="">rgan</span></u><span style=""> <u>to</u> </span><u><span style="">my</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>private</u> <u>organ</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">with the use of his left hand,<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
which she repeated in detail at one point of the cross-examination, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After you have removed your panty, what did
the accused do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He removed his hand . . . left hand on my
neck and moved his body a little to the back and he held his private organ and
inserted it into my private organ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Which hand did he use in inserting his
organ to yours?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He used his left hand."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">However, in another point during cross-examination,
she affirmed that the accused was beside her, and she was the one who took hold
of his penis and put it into her private organ:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you felt his body when <u>he</u> <u>was</u>
<u>beside</u> you at that night?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes,

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For how many minutes have (sic) you felt

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just for a short while, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because you immediately took hold of his
penis and put into your vagina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which she did for the following reason:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
so that you can immediately finish his intercourse?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lame excuse for such conduct offered by her on redirect
examination was because she was nervous as she was threatened by accused who
told her "you insert it otherwise I<span style="">
</span>will kill you including your children."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
He resorted to this because "at first he was not able to insert it";<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
yet, on direct examination, she categorically stated that when he was on top of
her he inserted his organ, and although she did not see how, she knew that it
was already inside.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">E</p>

<p class="BODY">While on direct examination, she wanted to convey that she was
reluctant to remove her panty, and in an earlier cross-examination, she wanted
the court to believe that she spread her legs preparatory to the intercourse
because she was allegedly ordered by the accused;<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
yet subsequently, she was candid enough to admit that she immediately removed
her panty and raised her dress for the intercourse, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
when this intruder allegedly told you to remove your panty, you immediately
removed your panty?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
<span style="">sir, </span>I obeyed him because I was
afraid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">However, in another portion of the
cross-examination, complainant, by slip of her tongue, admitted that she <span style="">in </span>fact voluntarily removed her panty,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">F</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, the cross examiner succeeded in showing
that the sexual liaison was the product of mutual consent, or the complainant
and the accused were "making love." The following questions and
answers are enlightening:</p>

<p class="BODY">This fear, however, seemed to be more imagined than real in the
light of the above findings clearly demonstrating her consent to the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, there is enough evidence
to show that she signaled to the accused to spend time with her and that she
prepared for the tryst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reasons only
known to the prosecution, it opted not to rebut the damaging testimony of the
accused that among others, complainant signaled to him to come up; she
thereafter took a bath; when he came up, she ordered him to get inside the
mosquito net, and to give him space beside her, she even moved her youngest
child; and then they simultaneously took off their clothes and made love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were in the act, Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> came out of her room and saw them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of embarrassment, complainant
cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then dressed up and returned
to the party.</p>

<p class="BODY">That Lydia saw them while they were making love is admitted by
complainant as indicated above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lydia,
however, has her own version.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According
to this version, which the trial court erroneously credited, when she woke up
at dawn of 16 April 1980, she saw the accused, who was 4½ meters away facing
the window with his back toward her, in the act of either buttoning or closing
the zipper of his pants; then he passed through the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then turned on the light and saw the
complainant inside the mosquito net sitting with her back against the <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lydia then got a glass of water,
gave it to her, and asked her what happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant was shaking and so Lydia waited until she calmed down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After she calmed down, she told Lydia that
she was raped by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, complainant's panty was still down on one foot.<a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Lydia, she was able to recognize the accused because
of the "<span style="">m</span>oonlight giving the
light inside the house." The fluorescent lamp was put off.<a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the complainant, when asked how she was able to identify the accused,
did not make mention of the light of the moon but of the "light in the
kitchen which was kept open at night."<a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The version of Lydia cannot prevail over the testimonies of both
the complainant and the accused that she (Lydia) saw them "in the act."</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">H</p>

<p class="BODY">The conduct of the complainant after the alleged rape is
inconsistent with that of one who had been subjected to a harrowing experience
under the bestial act of a rapist.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the alleged initial interest of the complainant and Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> to seek immediate redress and vindication as
evidenced by Lydia's immediate advice:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
<span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Patinio</span> informed
you that she was raped by <span class="SpellE">Pido</span> and after having
observed her condition, what did you do next?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
it was still dark and everybody was still asleep, I told her to go to (sic)
precinct but it is not proper because we have to go first to the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Chairman, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">yet, it was only on 30 May 1980 that the <span style="">sworn statement </span>of the complainant was
prepared.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
The delay has not been explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant did not report the incident to her common-law
husband, <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gam</span>, when
he arrived in the morning of the day it happened, 16 April 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to when she did so, she gave conflicting
versions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her direct testimony, she
declared that it was only on the following day that she "revealed to him
the truth."<a style="" href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[60]</sup></span></span></a>
Yet, on cross-examination, she declared that she reported it to him several
days after:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you are (sic) afraid that your cousin [referring to Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>]

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Lydia <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>,
however, claims that it was she who told complainant's husband:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
did the husband of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Patinio</span>
come to know about the incident?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

<p class="BODY">If she is to be believed, after the act, she just stood up to
"wear again her panty"; however, Lydia testified that complainant was
sitting inside the mosquito net with her back on the <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>
and her panty down on one foot only and although she was crying, it was not
loud enough, it would be heard only if one would come near her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that complainant told Lydia was that she
was raped by the accused, who threatened her and promised to "return
back."<a style="" href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[63]</sup></span></span></a>
When asked to describe the facial expression of complainant, the best that
Lydia could say was that she "looked pale."</p>

<p class="BODY">There was nothing in the complainant's behavior to show <span style="">a </span>natural reaction to a heinous
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">What then seems to be clear to Us is that Lydia did not arrive
after the act, but as testified by the accused and corroborated by complainant
herself, she saw both inside the mosquito net.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant was so embarrassed that she had to concoct the story of
rape.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's protestation that <span style="">she </span>was strangled or choked by the accused is belied by the
medical certificate prepared by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Reyes,
senior medico-legal officer of the National Bureau of Investigation, and his
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The medical certificate states:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No evident sign of <span class="SpellE">extragenital</span>
physical injury noted on the body of the subject at the time of
examination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, said medico-legal officer testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
examining the alleged victim, did you find any injury which caused by a (sic)

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing, the judicial mind cannot securely rest on a
verdict of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for
the prosecution fails to convince Us with moral certainty that the crime of
rape was committed and that the accused is guilty thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">The so-called offer of compromise would not save the day for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on this matter
is amorphous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as admitted by
the complainant, there was only a request <span style="">by

should not go through with the filing of the complaint; he did not offer any
monetary consideration; and that accused appellant was not even present during
