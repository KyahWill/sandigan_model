<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pedroso</span> was employed by
petitioner first, as a truck helper, and later as a delivery truck driver with
a monthly salary of P900.00 starting from 1966 until December 1984 when the
number of working days of private respondent was reduced to just two days a week
due to the financial losses suffered by the business of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, private respondent filed a complaint </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In a decision dated
September 12, 1985, the labor arbiter ruled that inasmuch as the working
arrangement of private respondent was rotated in such a way that the number of
his working days had been substantially reduced for more than six (6) months
since December, 1984 and considering that the financial crisis of petitioner
has not eased, private respondent is entitled to the payment of separation pay
as if he was actually retrenched, in the amount of P8<span class="GramE">,100.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

year of </span>service, whichever is higher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole
year."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the foregoing provision of law, an employer may terminate
the employment of any employee due to the following causes:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) installation of labor-saving devices; (2)
redundancy; (3) retrenchment to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prevent
</span>losses; and (4) the closing or cessation of operation of the
establishment or undertaking, unless the closing is for the purpose of
circumventing the provisions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is required that to effect such termination of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">any </span>employee, the employer must serve a written notice on the
workers and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">DOLE </span>at least one
(1) month before the intended date thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of such previous notice to DOLE must be to enable it to
ascertain the verity of the cause for termination of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In case of termination due to the installation of labor-saving
devices or redundancy the worker affected thereby shall be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">entitled </span>to separation pay equivalent
to at least one (1) month pay or to at least one month pay for every year of
service, whichever is higher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
in case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closure or cessation
of operations of the establishment or undertaking not due to serious business
losses or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">financial </span>reverses,
the separation pay shall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">be </span>equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half (1/2)
month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">this case, </span>it
is admitted that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">private </span>respondent
had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not </span>been terminated or
retrenched by petitioner but that due to financial crisis the number of working
days of private respondent was reduced to just two days a week.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner could not have been expected to
notify DOLE of the retrenchment of private respondent under the circumstances
for there was no intention to do so on the part of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, if an employee consented to his retrenchment
or voluntarily applied for retrenchment with the employer due to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span>installation of labor-saving
devices, redundancy, closure or cessation of operation or to prevent financial
losses to the business of the employer, the required previous notice to the
DOLE is not necessary as the employee thereby acknowledged the existence of a
valid cause for termination of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, considering that private respondent had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">been </span>rotated by petitioner for over
six (6) months due to the serious losses in the business so that private
respondent had been effectively deprived a gainful occupation thereby, and
considering further that the business of petitioner was ultimately closed and
sold off, the Court finds, and so holds that the NLRC correctly ruled that
private respondent was thereby constructively dismissed or retrenched from
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 286 of the Labor Code, it is provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 286.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
employment not deemed terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> suspension of the operation of a business or undertaking
for a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">period not exceeding six months,
or the fulfillment by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">employee of a military or civic duty shall
not terminate employment in all such cases, the employer shall reinstate the
employee to his former position without loss of seniority rights if he
indicates his desire to resume his work not later than one month from the
resumption of operations of his employer or from his relief from the military
or civic duty."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">From the foregoing it is clear that when
the <span class="SpellE"><u>bonafide</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"> </span>suspension of the operation of a business or undertaking exceeds
six (6) months then the employment of the employee shall be deemed terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, private respondent is entitled to one (1) month pay or at
least one-half (1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is
higher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court assumes that the award
of P8<span class="GramE">,100.00</span> separation pay in favor of the private
respondent was computed in accordance with the foregoing formula as provided by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, it should be recomputed
accordingly.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
