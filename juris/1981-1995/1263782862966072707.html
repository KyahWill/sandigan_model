				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In a sworn complaint filed on July 5, 1985,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the respondent Deputy Sheriff of Branch XXVI, Regional Trial Court, Medina, Misamis Oriental, was charged with abuse of authority, misconduct in office and ignorance of the law, in connection with the execution of judgment in Civil Cases Nos. 622-M and 688-M entitled, "Rafael Rodriguez v.&nbsp; The <i>City of Gingoog, et al.</i>" and "Silvino&nbsp; Lu Barro v. Gingoog&nbsp; City represented by Mayor Miguel P. Paderanga, et al.," respectively.<br><br>The charges and specifications are as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><table Â ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="12%"><div align="justify">Count 1 -</div></td> <td width="88%"> <div align="justify">Employing armed PC soldiers without authority from the court.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Count 2 -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Illegally levying on properties of third parties not included in the judgment.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Count 3 -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Levying on properties far beyond and in excess of the amount of the judgment.</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Count 4 -</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Garnishing the funds of the city and levying on and selling its properties by public auction.</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Specifically, it is alleged that:&nbsp; (1) the respondent, without authority from the court, employed two armed PC soldiers as escorts to intimidate and threaten the persons from whom a jeep and four Yamaha motorcycles were taken by him in enforcing a writ of execution;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> (2) on May 20, 1985, the respondent levied on and advertised for sale at public auction on July 3, 1985, properties of the complainants who were not party-defendants in Civil Case No. 688-M;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> (3) the amount to be satisfied was only for the total sum of P125,000.00 whereas the properties of the complainants levied upon was worth no less than P75,000.00;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and (4) knowing they were funds and properties of the City Government of Gingoog, he garnished the sum of P130,598.03 turned over to him by the Philippine National Bank, Gingoog City, and also levied on one jeep and four Yamaha motorcycles of this city.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>In his comment/explanation dated 16 August 1985, the respondent declared:<br><br>On the first charge, he formally requested the military escorts to maintain peace and order to protect him from bad elements since it was of public knowledge that Gingoog City was in a critically troubled situation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>On the second charge, he issued a notice of garnishment to the Philippine National Bank, Gingoog City, only after the decision in Civil Case No. 688-M became final and executory and in accordance with Appropriation Ordinance No. 23 under Resolution No. 233, Series of 1984, of the Sangguniang Panglungsod, Gingoog City.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>On the third charge, he levied on the private properties of complainants pursuant to the decision in the said case which clearly ruled that the defendants were liable jointly and severally for having acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's valid and just claim.&nbsp; Moreover, the tax declaration of the said private properties indicated they had a total value of only P48,684.00 whereas the balance of the garnishable amount was P72,955.60.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>On the fourth charge, he acted under the authority of the court which issued the decisions, orders and writs.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The administrative matter was referred to Hon. Pedro R. Luspo, Sr., Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Gingoog City, for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>At the pre-investigation conference, the respondent admitted all the facts alleged in Counts 2, 3, and 4 of the complaint but denied the factual allegations in Count No. 1.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In view of the fact that the decision of the lower court in Civil Case No. 622-M was affirmed by the Intermediate Appellate Court in two decisions dated June 12, 1985 and August 5, 1985,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the validity of the levy on the properties of the city government is now indisputable.&nbsp; Likewise rendered moot and academic is the question of the validity of the garnishment of the funds deposited with the PHilippine National Bank and the levy of the individual properties of the complainants Miguel Paderanga and Potenciano de los Reyes, as these issues have been put to rest by the affirmance of the lower court's judgment by default and the consequent order of execution in Civil case No. 688-M by the Intermediate Appellate Court and later the Supreme Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>The only issue to be resolved is whether the respondent abused his authority in securing the assistance of the two PC escorts in the implementation of the writ of execution.<br><br>On this matter, the investigating judge found that the respondent in the morning of June 1, 1985, without authority from the court, requested the assistance of two PC soldiers in serving the writ of execution.&nbsp; The soldiers were in civilian clothes but carried sidearms.&nbsp; The presence of the soldiers caused fear and apprehension among the employees of the complainants.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>The ruling in the case of <i>Wearever Textile Mills, Inc. v. Deputy Sheriff Bagaybayan</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> is squarely in point.&nbsp; As held in that case:<br><blockquote>"From the facts found by the investigating judge, it is clear that the respondent deputy sheriff abused his authority when he employed armed men to assist him and forced the gate open without a court order.&nbsp; The actuation of the deputy sheriff was aggravated by the fact that the armed men, although presumably members of the Philippine Constabulary, were not in uniform and were obviously employed to intimidate the security guards." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>The investigating judge found that the respondent was motivated by a malicious desire to embarrass and ridicule the complainants.&nbsp; The respondent argued against himself when he said he requested the soldiers to be in civilian clothes and not to bring firearms<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> while also stating that his request was prompted by the critical peace and order condition prevailing in the area.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> Moreover according to the investigating judge, the writ was served "in the heart of the City of Gingoog which is generally peaceful."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE, </b>the respondent Deputy Sheriff Rodriguez Orimaco is hereby declared guilty of abuse of authority and suspended from the service for a period of two (2) months without pay, with the warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; It is so ordered.<br><br><i>Yap, (Chairman), Narvasa, Melencio-Herrera</i>, and <i>Feliciano, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr size="1" width="60%" align="left" noshade="noshade"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Rollo, pp. 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Ibid.</i><br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id., </i>p. 2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><i> Id.</i> p. 3.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><i> Id.,</i> pp. 3-4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> <i>Id.,</i> pp. 4-5.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Id.,</i> pp. 20-21.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>Id.,</i> pp. 21-22.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Id.,</i> pp. 22-23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> <i>Id.</i> p. 23.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> TSN, April 29 and 30, 1986, pp. 35, 119, 120, 121.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; Annexes "1" and "2", respectively, Respondent's Memorandum; <i>Id.,</i> pp. 154-169.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Annexes "3" and "4", respectively, Respondent's Memorandum; <i>Id.,</i> pp. 170-180.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Report and Recommendation, pp. 11, 13; Rollo, pp. 192, 194.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; 109 SCRA 412.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> TSN, April 30, 1986, p. 125.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>&nbsp; <i>Rollo,</i> p. 200.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> <i>Ibid., </i>p. 194.<br></div>
