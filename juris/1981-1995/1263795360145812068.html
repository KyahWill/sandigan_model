<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As a result of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a bargaining </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

charges </span>pending against them before the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span>
office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, non-strikers similarly
facing criminal indictments were readily readmitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a complaint for unfair labor practice
against petitioner Companies was filed on <st1:date year="1958" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1958</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint specifically charged the petitioners with -- (1) interfering with the
exercise of the workers' right to concerted activity; and (2) discriminating
against Union members <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>regards
readmission to work after the strike on the basis of union membership and
degree of participation in the strike.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">After trial on the merits, the Court of
Industrial Relations, through presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>

us by respondent Unions docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>G.

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1971</st1:date>,
this Court rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>decision

review made by this Court of the determination of facts reached by the Court of
Industrial Relations and the consequent revision of the said findings of
fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arguments of then respondent
Companies centered on their objection that the Court erred in finding them
guilty of unfair labor practice.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>resolution
dated March 10, 1977 (76 SCRA 50), this Court found no sufficient or compelling
reasons to depart from the judgment embodied in the decision of January 30,
1971, save for the pronouncement on <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> which
we fixed at "the total equivalent of three (3) years without qualification
or deduction, as applicable to and fully justified in the case at bar."
The petitioners' motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioner Companies filed on March 16, 1977 a
"Motion for Clarification" of a portion of the March 10, 1977
resolution, asking whether or not the payment of the three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> shall be at the pay rates <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>of June 2, 1958, (the date of the act of discrimination or
discharge of the Union members) or the current pay rates for positions similar
or comparable to those previously held by them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In line with our ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Davao</u></span>

held, in a resolution dated May 5, 1977, that "the computation of the said
<span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is at the rate that the petitioners
entitled thereto were actually receiving and being paid at the time of
dismissal and strike x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
without deduction and qualification x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>", i.e., June 2, 1958.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We declared the resolution final and
immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the court's resolution of <st1:date year="1977" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1977</st1:date>, the petitioners paid in full the
total amount of three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> awarded to
the dismissed employees except four of them, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Ibarra, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blas</span>
Ventura and Jose <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>, who had reached the
retirement age while the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>pending
before us.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because of the petitioner Companies' refusal to reinstate the
aforementioned union members and their alleged sham reinstatement of others,
the Unions sued the Companies for contempt before respondent NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After hearing the parties, the respondent
NLRC issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>resolution, dated
July 28, 1978 finding petitioner Companies guilty of contempt and ordered them
through their respective presidents, to pay a fine of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00)
each.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A petition for <i>certiorari</i>
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">filed with us, docketed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-49071, questioning the aforesaid
resolution of the NLRC.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Companies alleged that the respondent Commission erred
in ordering the petitioners to pay the four (4) Union members an amount equal
to their daily salaries beginning May 16, 1977, until they are actually
reinstated, in utter disregard of the fact that they had been retired upon
reaching the age of sixty (60) years in 1963, 1970, 1974 and 1977, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, they alleged that the Commission
erred in arbitrarily ordering the petitioners to pay all reinstated employees
differential salaries "by way of salary rate adjustments" on the
basis of "the actual pay rates of the respondent companies' other employees
with comparable seniority" because this is an unwarranted deviation from
the final judgment of this Court in G.R. No. L-25291, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, they assailed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the order of contempt as well as the fine
imposed on them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 17, 1985, this Court rendered a decision affirming the
assailed resolution of the respondent NLRC, save, however, the pronouncement
finding petitioner Companies guilty of contempt (135 SCRA 697).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the aforementioned decision became final, the private respondents
filed with the execution arm of the respondent NLRC a "Motion for
Computation of Judgment", dated <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Order dated July 24, 1985, the respondent Labor Arbiter
directed the Chief, Research and Information Division, NLRC, to designate the
Socio-Economic Analyst "to compute the award in accordance with the
decision" of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 3, 1985, Analysts <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span>
B. Paz and <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pancito</span>
of the Research and Information Division of the NLRC submitted their
"Report of Examiner" indicating that the sums of money due to the
thirty-four (34) members of the private respondents amounted to P1<span class="GramE">,415,437.56</span>, representing their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
computed for a period of three (3) years, salary differentials, fringe benefits
and retirement pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1986</st1:date>,
the respondent Labor Arbiter of the Execution Arm issued the disputed order
which computed the benefits under the decision of this Court in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">aggregate </span>amount
of P2<span class="GramE">,348,334.13</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1986</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed their motion for reconsideration of the order now subject
of this present review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1986</st1:date>,
private respondents filed their motion to dismiss, alleging that the
petitioners' motion for reconsideration was filed beyond the ten-day period
provided in Article 223 of the Labor Code for appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, treating the petitioners' motion for reconsideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as an </span>appeal, the respondent
Commission issued its disputed resolution dismissing the petitioners' motion
filed on January 28, 1986 on the ground that the order appealed from had
already become final, a day before, on January 27, 1986, ten (10) calendar days
after the receipt by the petitioners of the order dated January 17, 1986.</p>

<span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Ventura and Jose <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span> with this Court's decision in G.R. No. L-9071,

to the issues to which G. R. No. L-49071 addresses itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case arose from petitioner Companies'
initial refusal to reinstate Union members <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
Ibarra, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Ventura and Jose <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>

petitioners allege that the respondent Commission erred in ordering them to pay
the four Union members their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> "in utter
disregard of the fact that the latter had been retired upon reaching the age of
sixty (60) years in 1963, 1970, 1974 and 1977, respectively." Stated otherwise,
it is alleged that the Commission erred in awarding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to respondents who are not, in the first place, entitled to reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Unions aver:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"In effect, what petitioners would have
respondent Commission do is to materially alter the Honorable Supreme Court's
longstanding, final judgment by excluding from the benefit of its reinstatement
order the four (4) mentioned union members whom petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">claim had already been retired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This of course, respondent Commission is not
authorized to do."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to which the
respondent employees are entitled was settled by this Court in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-25291.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In our
resolution dated <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1977</st1:date>,
we held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
[W]e are also constrained to reassess the ruling in our decision of January 30,
1971 to the effect that the strikers must receive <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
from the date of the act of discrimination, that is, from the date of their
discharge or their offer to return to work up to the date of their actual
reinstatement, deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> whatever they have
earned pending readmission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Considering all the circumstances at bar, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the Court considers the fixing and limitation of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> award to their total equivalent from three years without
qualification and deduction as applicable to and justified in the case at
bar."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, respondent Commission, in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1978</st1:date>, awarded daily salaries
from <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1977</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1985</st1:date>, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>period of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">eight (8) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Commission gravely erred in
doing so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The law of the case has been established in G. R. No. <span class="GramE">L-25291.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to which all reinstated employees are entitled
has been set to the equivalent for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>period of three (3) years of the rate of
pay at the time of their dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is in accord with the doctrine laid down by the trail-blazing <u>Mercury</u> <u>Drug</u>
<u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u> <u>Relations</u> (56 SCRA
694) case which to this day remains the rule in cases of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">same </span>or
similar circumstances (<span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span> Consolidated Mining
Co. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">v. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>,
136 SCRA 258).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The formula calls for
fixing the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification
and </span>deduction to three (3) years, subject to deduction where there are
mitigating circumstances in favor of the employer but subject to increase by
way of exemplary damages where there are aggravating circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the petitioners having been absolved of
the contempt charges against them, no aggravating circumstances would warrant
an increased award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the respondent Arbiter's award of leave benefits, the
decree on <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> is understood to be inclusive of
such benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grant of three years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification and deduction by the court
necessarily takes into consideration holidays, vacation leaves and service
incentive leaves, paying for all working days regardless of whether or not the
same fall on holidays or employees' leave days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Having already paid these benefits, petitioners can not be burdened to
pay the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">again.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>With regard to the award of allowances
by respondent Labor Arbiter, we held in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Soriano</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u>v.</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<u>Relations</u> <u>Commission,</u> </span><u>et</u> <u>al.</u> (G. R. No.
75510, October 27, 1987) that "the salary base properly used in computing
the separation pay and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due to petitioner
should include not just the basic salary but also the regular allowances that
petitioner had been receiving (See Santos v. National Labor Relations
Commission, G. R. No. 76721, September 21, 1987)." Thus, the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in the case at bar is, likewise, deemed to cover
the allowances claimed by respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to salary differentials, we have already made clear that the
rate at which the three-year <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> shall be
computed "at the rate that the petitioners are entitled thereto were
actually receiving and being paid at the time of dismissal and strike, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, i.e., <st1:date year="1958" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1958</st1:date>." To award salary differentials
would be to deviate from our ruling in G. R. No. L-25291 <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
and would, in effect, be granting <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> at the
current pay rates for positions similar or comparable to those previously held
by the respondents which we did not, in the first place allow.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>settled rule that upon reinstatement, illegally dismissed employees are
to be paid their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without deduction and
qualification as to any <u>wage</u> <u>increases</u> or <u>other</u> <u>benefits</u>
that may have been received by their co-workers who were not dismissed or did
not go on strike (<span class="SpellE">Durabuilt</span> Recapping Plant &amp;

policy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the issue of retirement pay, the petitioners
question the award of retirement benefits from the date of their respective
employments <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">up </span>to <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1985</st1:date> (the date G. R. No.
L-49071 was promulgated) to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the
four retirees <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> Ibarra, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> Ventura and Jose <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span>; (2) the strikers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

not reported back to work at any time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is argued that retirement benefits to be awarded respondent employees
should span only up to the date when they reached their sixtieth (60th)
birthday in accordance with the companies' retirement policies.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset, it must be noted that the original decision in G.
R. No. L-25291 provides no more than the grant of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to the petitioners' dismissed workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No salary differentials, fringe benefits and retirement benefits were
decreed by the court to warrant the respondent Arbiter's award thereof on
execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fundamental is the rule that execution must conform to that
ordained or decreed in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the
decision (<span class="SpellE">Laingo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>,
130 SCRA 144).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An order of execution
which varies the tenor of the judgment or exceeds the terms thereof is a
nullity (<span class="SpellE">Gamboa's</span> Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 72 SCRA
131; see <span class="SpellE">Villoria</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Piccio</span>,
95 Phil. 802).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter's order
is fatally infirm to that extent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, we go on to discuss the matter on retirement
benefits claimed by respondent employees to avoid further litigation between
the parties on the matter which may further delay the full and final
disposition of the case (National Housing Authority v. Court of Appeals, 121
SCRA 777)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Paragraph (a), Section
14, Rule 1, Book VI provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 14.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Retirement</u> <u>benefits</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-- (a) An employee who is retired pursuant to
a bona fide retirement plan or in accordance with the applicable individual or
collective agreement or established employer policy shall be entitled to all
the retirement benefits provided therein or to termination pay equivalent at
least to one-half month salary for every year of service, whichever is higher,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">An employee's years of service,
therefore, are determinative of the extent of retirement benefits due him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent retirees, Ibarra, <span class="SpellE">Ner</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Ventura</st1:place></st1:city>
and <span class="SpellE">Castillon</span> capitalize on this provision of law
alleging that because of the petitioners' failure to reinstate them, upon order
of the court in G. R. No. L-25291 on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="3">March
 10, 1977</st1:date>, they were unable to be retired, their retirement being possible
only on <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, computation of their retirement
benefits should include the period during which they were deprived of their
right to retire.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">This cannot be
allowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent employees are
covered by the petitioner Companies' retirement plan </span>which prevails <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the law in their cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plan grants retirement benefits to
employees upon reaching the age of sixty (60).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beyond such age, they cease to be covered by the petitioners' retirement
policy regardless of whether or not they continue in the companies'
employ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the computation of
benefits accruing under the plan cannot go beyond the stipulated date of
retirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the case at bar,
respondents would have been retired upon reaching the <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">age </span>of sixty (60), regardless of whether or not they had been
immediately reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondents'
tardy reinstatement could not have delayed the arrival <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>their compulsory date of
retirement under the policy as to grant them additional benefits beyond such
date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the application and payment
of benefits have been delayed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
their reinstatement, they could then apply for retirement benefits already due
them in accordance with the Companies' policies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the respondents aver, their employment is
deemed continuous or uninterrupted by their illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By their own arguments, the respondents'
retirement cannot be deemed to have been postponed by their dismissal and for
purposes of computing retirement benefits, years of service shall be understood
to be the period extending from the employee's date of hiring to the compulsory
date of retirement which, in this case, is the date of the employee's sixtieth
(60th) birthday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">cannot be extended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same rule applies to all other <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the aforementioned rule on computation of retirement benefits based on the
employee's years of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All those
who, before their final date of termination have reached the age of sixty (60)
shall be entitled to retirement benefits from date of hiring to the date of
their sixtieth birth anniversary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those

company policy shall, likewise prevail, the same being based on the employment
contracts or collective bargaining agreements between the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the petitioners had explained, pursuant to
their policies on the matter, the service award differential is given at the
end of the year to an employee who has completed years of service divisible by
five (5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, employees who, at the
time of their separation have completed years of service divisible by five from
the time of their reinstatement in May, 1977 shall be entitled to such
