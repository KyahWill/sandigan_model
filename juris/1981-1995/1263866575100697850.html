<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as culled from the pleadings, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 5, 1971, the then Public Service Commission granted
certificates of public convenience to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
Laguna <span class="SpellE">Tayabas</span> Bus Co., Inc. (BLTB) for the operation
of twelve (12) bus units on the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City - <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> City line (Case No. 70?5749); six (6) bus

<span style="">line (Case No. 70- 5751) (pp. 59-64, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 4, 1975, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Pantranco</span>
South Express, Inc. (PANTRANCO) filed a complaint against BLTB before public
respondent Board of Transportation (BOT), docketed as Case No. 75-31-C,
charging it with abandonment of services on said lines from August, 1971 to
April, 1975 and praying for the cancellation of <span class="SpellE">BLTB's</span>
certificates of public convenience (pp. 69-70, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1976</st1:date>,

charging BLTB with abandoning said services from March, <span style="">1975 to March, 1976 and reiterating its prayer for the cancellation of
the certificates of </span>public <span style="">convenience
(pp. 77-78, </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">BLTB </span>did not file
any written answer either to the complaint in Case No. 75-31-C or to the urgent

<blockquote>“3. At said hearings, Respondent admitted non-operation of the bus
services authorized in Cases Nos. 70-5749, 70-5750 and 70-5751 and thus the
need for Complainant to present evidence in both proceedings may be dispensed
with.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1979</st1:date>,
the BOT issued an order, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads (p. 133, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>):</p>

<blockquote>"In view of all the foregoing, this Board, in addition to its
rulings mentioned above -</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1. Orders respondent to operate within fifteen (15) days from
date hereof the whole complement of twenty-eight (28) units authorized under
the said certificates, utilizing for the purpose such units presently
authorized as RESERVES and inform the Board within ten (10) days from
commencement of operation, the makes and motor numbers of the units to be
operated for each line and the case numbers under which they are authorized for
appropriate entry in the records of the above-entitled cases, and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. Orders the fine of P10,000.00 imposed above to be paid to
this Board within ten (10) days from receipt by it of a copy of this Order and
declares the consolidated complaints filed in the above-entitled cases closed
and terminated.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Failure of respondent/applicant to comply with any of the
foregoing requirements shall be considered sufficient cause for this Board to
withdraw the authority herein granted.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It rationalized the non-cancellation of <span class="SpellE">BLTB's</span> certificates of public convenience, as follows (pp. <span style="">128 A - </span>133, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>):</p>

<blockquote>"Obviously, cancellation of a certificate of public
convenience is a penalty of the severest degree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its consequences are suffered not exclusively
by the operator; it extends to the <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> public
whose needs for transportation facilities would further be aggravated by a
diminution of needed services.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, where such a penalty is prayed for, this Board requires
the evidence to be strong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than that
this Board must apply the less severe penalties provided for by law, but equally
disciplinary in nature.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 16 (n) of the Public Service Law empowers this Board ‘to
suspend or revoke any certificate x <span class="SpellE">x</span> whenever the
holder thereof has violated or willfully (sic) and contumaciously refused to
comply with any order, rule or regulation of the Board or any provision of this
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>’<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

service during which such default or violation continues x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x'<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A reading of both provisions would show that failure to
comply with the terms and conditions of any certificate of public convenience
is basically punished with a fine, unless the violation is <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
or contumacious, in which case the penalty of suspension, or cancellation may
be imposed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Judged by the foregoing standards, this Board declares the
evidence of the complainant to be sadly lacking in elements that would qualify
the respondent's failure to operate as <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> and
contumacious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True the respondent did
not operate on its certificate from the time it was granted on <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1971</st1:date> up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had not justified its non-operation from
said date up to <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But on <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1972</st1:date>, the respondent justified its non?operation by
writing to the Board, that because of unfinished portions of the road it could
not render the service authorized by the Board to be rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board never overruled the respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this point, it must be borne in mind that whether in the
case of application for new services, or for the cancellation of lines already
granted, this Board must determine what the public need is.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This leads us into discussing what the public need is in the
areas covered by the certificates of public convenience in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Board, in its
desire to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be responsive to public need,
has always kept itself informed of actual and latest transportation conditions
in the provinces, including the <span class="SpellE">Bicol</span> region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thru reports/complaints from the general
public, from reports of its <span class="SpellE">fieldmen</span>, and from its
own personal observations acquired thru inspection trips, this Board is aware
that buses which are operating are very much less than what has been
authorized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was officially

agents and inspectors that are periodically submitted to it (see La <span class="SpellE">Mallorca</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> <span style="">Bus </span>Co., Inc. v. Mercado, G.R. <span style="">No. </span>L­19120, <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1965</st1:date>, 15 SCRA 343).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the BOT has the power to take into
consideration the result of its own observation and investigation of the matter
<span style="">submitted to it for </span>decision, <span style="">in connection with other </span>evidence
presented at the hearing of a case (Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., et al. v.
N. &amp; <span style="">B. </span>Stables Co., Inc.,
60 Phil. 851 <span style="">citing </span>Manila
Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Danon</span>, 58 Phil.
75; Manila Electric Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Balagtas</span>, 58 Phil. 429).</p>

<p class="BODY">Taking into consideration <span class="SpellE">BLTB's</span> letter
dated <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1972</st1:date>,
it acted in good faith when it did not immediately operate on those lines and
not because of a design to prejudice public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certificates of public convenience involve
investment of a big amount of capital, both in securing the certificate and in
maintaining the operation of the lines covered thereby, and mere failure to
operate temporarily should not be a ground for cancellation, especially as
when, in the case at bar, the suspension of the service was directly caused by
circumstances beyond the operator's control (<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Transportation Co. v. F.F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, et al., 95 Phil.
694).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of showing that
there is willful and contumacious violation on the part of the utility
operator, no certificate of public convenience may be validly revoked (<span class="SpellE">Manzanal</span> v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ausejo</span></span><span style="">, </span>et
al., G.R. No. L-31056, <st1:date year="1988" day="4" month="8">August <span style="">4, </span>1988</st1:date>, 164 SCRA
36).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, what cannot be
ignored is that the needs of the public are paramount, as elucidated by the BOT
in its order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise of its power
to grant or cancel certificates of public convenience, the BOT is guided by
public necessity and convenience as primary considerations (see <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. Public Service Commission, et al., G.R. No.
L-34820, <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1973</st1:date>, 50
SCRA 500).</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, <span class="SpellE">PANTRANCO's</span> purpose in
instituting the proceedings for cancellation of <span class="SpellE">BLTB's</span>
certificates of public convenience is to remove it (BLTB) as a competitor in
the business in which they are both engaged (see <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
Transportation Co. v. F.F. <span class="SpellE">Halili</span>, et al., <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">), </span>which is detestable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Experience has demonstrated that healthy competition always redounds to
the benefit of the commuters and the development of transportation as a whole.</p>
