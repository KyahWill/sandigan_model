<p class="BODY"><span style="">This case originated from
the civil action instituted by Go Tin and Julian Lee, mother and son, on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="8"><span style="">August
 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, against
Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong and the latter's sons, </span><span style="">docketed as </span><span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Case No. 58734 in
the </span><span style="">Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch XIX, presided by the Hon. Agustin P. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>,
for <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> and Accounting with
Receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sought to recover
their share, as widow and child, in the estate of the deceased Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, who had died in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> in 1935, leaving property conservatively
valued at P100,000.00, consisting of an interest in a partnership of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partnership had been liquidated and Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay's</span> share was taken </span><span style="">over, managed and administered, allegedly in trust for the benefit of
the widow and children of the deceased, by Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong, second eldest son of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, the eldest being
sickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong then invested the assets of the estate in the corporation known as Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, Inc. (the
Corporation, for brevity).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Complaint expressly
alleged "that in breach of </span><span style="">his
</span><span style="">trust and in grave abuse of the
confidence reposed on him by the plaintiffs (widow and son), defendant Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong clandestinely maneuvered and manipulated the
affairs of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>,
Inc., by forming a partnership known as Alaska Lumber Co. making it appear in
the records of the partnership that he and his deceased wife (Mina S.
Capistrano) alone were parties in said partnership </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> ;" that Alaska Lumber Co. and the other
firms organized </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong were
mere "fronts" to enable him to siphon the assets of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, Inc. to his
exclusive personal benefit to the exclusion and prejudice of plaintiffs mother
and son and other heirs of the deceased Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>; that
"all the assets of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, the Alaska Lumber Co., the <span class="SpellE">Uno</span>
Lumber Co., the New Venus Lumber, the Era Incorporated operating the Paris
Motel, and Parkway Trading should be impressed with a constructive trust as
being part of the conjugal estate of the deceased Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>
and plaintiff Go Tin, since 11/20 thereof rightfully and legally belongs to
plaintiff Go Tin and a proportionate 1/20 share thereof belongs to plaintiff
Julian Lee."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Complaint then
prayed, considering plaintiffs' actual and existing legal and beneficial
interest, for the appointment of a receiver of the assets, properties and funds
of all the firms serving as "fronts" for the fraudulent acts and
manipulations </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">defendant Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong and his children, namely, defendants Jesus C. Lee, Joseph. C. Lee and John
C. Lee, as the most convenient and feasible means of preserving and protecting
these properties and funds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The case is still pending
trial in the Court below, now unfortunately delayed because of the controversy
over the appointment of a Receiver during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of the action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants-respondents,
Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong and sons (the LEES, for short), deny
widow and son's interest in the properties and funds involved alleging that Go
Tin is not the legitimate wife of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and,
therefore, is not entitled to share in the latter's estate; and that the
properties left by Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> are </span><span style="">all </span><span style="">under the control and administration of the Corporation with its own
duly constituted officers charged with safeguarding and protecting the assets
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is emphasized further that
of the nine children of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, only plaintiff
Julian Lee filed the Complaint against their elder brother, Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> </span><span style="">Hong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong's </span><span style="">wife,
Mina S. Capistrano, died in 1963, their son, John C. Lee, was appointed
administrator of her estate consisting of about 80% of the assets and
properties of Alaska Lumber </span><span style="">Co.,
</span><span style="">in Special Proceeding No. 54999

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The LEES then filed a

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Also, on June 30, 1965,
this time after the Decision in CA-G.R. No. 35009-R had been rendered, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Instead of moving for

and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction with the Court of Appeals, docketed
as CA-G.R. No. 36093-R (Second <i>Certiorari</i> Petition), seeking to nullify
the aforementioned Orders including the Receivership Order, which had already
been passed upon in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A temporary Restraining Order was issued on </span><st1:date year="1965" day="3" month="8"><span style="">August 3,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the meantime, upon

which was later raised to P4,000.00 for the use of its 2-1/2 hectares of land </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Juan Luna Street, Manila, together with its sawmill, machineries and
equipment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the trial
Court in its Order of </span><st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="8"><span style="">August 2, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> authorized the Receiver to pay the
Corporation the amount of P402,000.00 out of Alaska Lumber Co.'s deposit in the

Petition (CA-G.R. No. 36093-R) denying <i>Certiorari</i> once more on the
ground that the validity of the Receivership Order was assailed and fully
litigated in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition (CA-G.R. No. 35009-R), and
since no appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was duly perfected, it has
become final and no longer open to further liti­gation pursuant to the
"law of the case" doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Right or wrong, it is binding on both the trial Court and the

jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">II.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, in the Amendatory Decision, committed an
error of law <span style="">in </span>ignoring and not
applying the well-settled doctrine that the petitioners' failure to file with
the Court below a motion for reconsideration of the order subject of the <i>certiorari</i>
proceeding is a fatal and insurmountable barrier' (Collector of Internal
Revenue vs. Reyes, G.R. No. L-8685, <st1:date year="1957" day="11" month="1">January

1964, June 30, 1965 and August 2, 1965, without first presenting the proper
motions for reconsideration before the trial court was fatally defective.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">III.</span></b><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The </span>Court of Appeals, in the
same Amendatory Decision, committed a similar serious error of law in taking
cognizance in CA-G.R. No. 36093-R, and, as a matter of fact, resolving <span style="">in </span>a diametrically opposite manner in
said proceeding the question of receivership, which was the principal question
raised and adjudicated in the previous <i>certiorari</i> proceeding, CA-G.R.
No. 35009-R, after the decision therein had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> for failure of the petitioners to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><span style="">IV.</span></b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, in the same Amendatory Decision, committed an
error of law in failing to consider the clear nature and scope of the Order of

June 30, 1965, were mere implementing orders issued to carry out the basic Order
of November 13, 1964, which Order was upheld in the decision in CA-G.R. No.

the assets of the firm placed under receivership.</blockquote>

and, as a matter of fact, reversing a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is plain from the

issue was fully litigated and resolved in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition
(CA-G.R. No. 35009-R).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And yet, in the
Second <i>Certiorari</i> Petition (CA-G.R. No. 36093-R), one of the ultimate
goals of the action was again "to nullify the order of the respondent
Judge of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="11"><span style="">November 13, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Assailing the
Receivership Order on jurisdictional grounds can no longer be successfully
done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principle of bar by prior
judgment, one of the aspects of the doctrine of </span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">res</span></i></span><i><span style=""> </span></i><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">judicata</span></i></span><span style=""> or <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by
judgment as known to Anglo-American jurisprudence, comes into play and
precludes the re-litigation in another <i>Certiorari</i> proceeding of the
specific question actually litigated and resolved in the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition, which is, the validity of the Receivership Order which included
"taking custody" of the properties and funds and "managing"
the businesses involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Second <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition must be held to be barred by the prior judgment in the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition, there being identity of parties, subject matter and cause of action
between the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition where the original Decision was
rendered, and the Second <i>Certiorari</i> Petition which sought to assail
again the Receivership Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further,
the judgment </span>in <span style="">the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition is a final one rendered by a Court of competent jurisdiction upon the
merits, there having been no appeal perfected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And even under the
"law of the case" doctrine, as aptly held in the original Decision in
the Second <i>Certiorari</i> Petition (CA-G.R. No. 36093-R), the Receivership
Order </span>is <span style="">no longer open to
further litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It constitutes the
controlling legal rule between the parties and can not be modified or amended.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"By 'law of the case' is meant that whatever is once
irrevocably established as the controlling legal rule or decision between the
same parties in the same case continues to be the law of the case so long as
the facts on which such decision was predicated continue to be the facts of the
case before the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, it was erroneous
for the Amendatory Decision to hold that the trial Court "abused its
discretion in authorizing the receiver to take possession and custody of all
the funds, assets and properties of the Alaska Lumber Co., as well as its
management, particularly before the final adjudication of the rights of the
parties".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To contend that the
Receivership Order merely "authorized" the appointment of the
Receiver as shown </span>in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of the Decision in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition, and did not include
"custody" nor "management" is to conveniently close one's
eyes to the basic text of the Receivership Order, to wit,</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is contended, however,

to the present proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First,
because the parties are not all the same considering <span style="">the entry into the picture of the intestate estate </span><span style="">of </span>Mina S. Capistrano upon the
approval by the lower court of Administrator John C. Lee's motion to intervene
as defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, because the only
issue in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition was the validity of the <span style="">appointment of the Receiver, while the
present case involves the validity of several acts of the Receiver occurring
after the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And third, because the Decision in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition
was not intended to be the final word as to subsequent acts of the Receiver
because of the Appellate Court's statement that "if at the hearing, it
will be shown that such appointment was uncalled for, the error may be
corrected by promptly asking the court to revoke the same."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We cannot subscribe to
the foregoing views.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental
that the application of the rule of </span><span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></i> may not <span style="">be evaded by simply including additional parties in a subsequent
litigation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There is still identity of parties although

is not such a necessary party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While the non-finality of
the appointment of the Receiver may be conceded in the sense that it may be
revoked during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action, yet it
cannot be gainsaid that the Decision of the Appellate Court in the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition upholding the validity of the appointment was, in legal contemplation,
final, no appeal having been perfected <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The argument that the only
issue in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition was the validity of the appointment
of the Receiver, while in the second, it is the validity of the several acts of
the Receiver after the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition, is tenuous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ignores the </span><span style="">full </span><span style="">scope of the Receivership
Order, which included not only the custody of the assets, properties and funds
claimed, but also the management of the businesses involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order of December 4, 1964 authorizing the
Sheriff to take over custody of properties and turn them over to the Receiver,
and that of June 30, 1965 denying the Motion for the surrender of the
properties of Alaska Lumber Co. to the intestate estate of Mina S. Capistrano,
are part and parcel of the custody and management specifically entrusted to the
Receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not alter the effects
of the basic <span style="">Receivership </span>Order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were allied Orders issued in
implementation and furtherance thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Order of </span><st1:date year="1964" day="14" month="12"><span style="">December 14, 1964</span></st1:date><span style=""> denying the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
for the discharge of the Receiver, upholds the custody granted the Receiver,
and was within the </span><span style="">discretion </span><span style="">of the trial Court to grant or deny.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In so far as the Order of
August 2, 1965 is concerned, which required the payment of rentals by Alaska
Lumber Co. in the sum of P402,000.00 </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">favor of the
Corporation, suffice it to say that this Order was issued only after
examination under oath of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong as to the
rentals due from the Alaska Lumber Co. to the Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Court, therefore, cannot be faulted
with grave abuse of discretion in issuing said Order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But even if the cause of
action in the Second <i>Certiorari</i> Petition were different, the issue
determined in the First <i>Certiorari</i> Petition, to reiterate, the validity
of the Receivership Order, must, as between the same parties, be taken as
conclusively established so long as the judgment in the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition remains unmodified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the
rule on conclusiveness of judgment, another aspect of the <span class="SpellE"><i>res</i></span><i>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>Amendatory Decision likewise holds that the "legal
interest" of mother and son in the properties held either by the
Corporation or by Alaska Lumber Co., an indispensable requisite or receivership
(Sec. 1(b), Rule 59), is non-existent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, this is a matter that was passed upon and litigated in CA-G.R.
No. 35009-R.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the appellate Court
in that case squarely held:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that the respondent Judge conducted a hearing of
the respondents' motion of <st1:date year="1964" day="3" month="11">November 3,
 1964</st1:date>, reiterating the prayer of the complaint for appointment of a
receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although during the hearing no
evidence was presented in support of the allegations of the complaint showing
the existence of the plaintiffs' interest in the properties and <span style="">funds </span>of the corporations, partnerships
and <span style="">business </span>enterprises
abovementioned, and the defendants had vigorously insisted that the plaintiffs
have no legal interest in the estate of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, as
shown by the fact that in Annex A, which is the deed of partition of the estate
of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>, plaintiff Go Tin is not included among
those who have a share in the estate, the respondent Judge was satisfied, and <span style="">in </span>this we agree with him, that the
plaintiffs have an interest in the properties of the corporations, partnerships
and business enterprises which are alleged as 'fronts' for the diversion of the
assets of the estate of the deceased, Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, to the respondent Judge there
was a <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> <u>facie</u> </span>showing of the existence
of the plaintiffs' interest in said entities on the basis of the allegations of
the complaint, and he did not consider it necessary for the plaintiffs to
present evidence in support thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
this stand of the respondent Judge, we see no abuse of discretion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondents' allegation that Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong diverted the share of the deceased Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> in
the partnership, Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>,
to the corporation, Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>, Inc., where it is made to appear that the principal
stockholders are Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong, his wife, M.S.
Capistrano, defendant Lee Chi <span class="SpellE">Chiao</span> and other persons
designated by Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong, sufficiently shows the
danger of dissipation, loss or misappropriation thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their further allegation that the share of Go
Tin in the conjugal partnership or community property, as the case may be, and
her hereditary portion, which constitute 11/20 thereof, were not to be included
as property of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> and Lee <span class="SpellE">Chay</span>,
Inc., but to be administered by Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> Hong together
with the 1/20 <span style="">share of her son, Julian
Lee, and notwithstanding this arrangement their shares were </span>so <span style="">included, sufficiently indicates the exist</span>ence
<span style="">of an actual and existing legal
interest in the properties under the control of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>If through subterfuge and
clandestine manipulations their shares are <span style="">actually utilized for the exclusive personal benefit of the defendants,
</span>such a state of affairs portrays the danger of their being lost or mate<span style="">rially injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="">claim that plaintiffs are the owners of a total share of 12/20 in the
properties and funds of said corporation, partnerships and business enterprises
which are actually managed, operated and controlled by Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong, not for the benefit of all heirs but for him, his Children and other
relatives is not flimsy or unfounded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, their shares may be extended the protection that the law
on receivership affords.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relief
sought that the defendants be ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to
them the said 12/20 </span><span style="">share in the
properties and funds of the above-mentioned corporations, partnerships and
business enterprise, and to account for the fruits and income thereof from the
year 1937 up to the present when defendant Lee <span class="SpellE">Tek</span>
Hong has been the sole administrators, manager and possessor thereof,
reinforces the need for safeguarding their shares, interest and participation
in the estate of Lee <span class="SpellE">Tay</span> in order that a judgment to
that effect may not be rendered ineffectual and illusory."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the Amendatory
Decision, therefore, to rule anew on the presence or absence of legal interest
would be to amend a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> pronouncement
</span><span style="">in </span><span style="">CA-G.R. No. 35009-R, and to violate the

transfer them to the hands of a receiver specially one not appointed as such in
a direct action involving their dissolution and liquidation." Again, the
matter of inclusion of parties was resolved in the Decision in the First <i>Certiorari</i>
Petition (CA-G.R. No. 53009-R), thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The petitioners contend that <span style="">as </span>the said corporations, partnerships and business enterprises
