				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In view of the prolonged and persistent failure of Atty. Alfredo Z. Villanueva, counsel for petitioner, to comply with our Resolution of 11 April 1994 notwithstanding the extension of his period to do so and despite his earlier incarceration by reason thereof, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> the Court Resolves to DENY the petition.<br><br>Atty. Villanueva has taxed the patience and forbearance of this Court. His failure, if not refusal, to submit the required reply is a wanton disregard of our orders. His continued apathy already borders on insolence which we cannot allow to pass without the corresponding sanction. All lawyers are expected to recognize the authority of the Supreme Court and to obey its lawful processes and orders <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and if he has not taken this to heart he is unfit to engage in the practice of law. His failure to live up to the duties and responsibilities of the legal profession is sufficient ground for suspension. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, the Court further Resolves to SUSPEND Atty. Alfredo Z. Villanueva from the practice of law for six (6) months effective immediately upon his receipt of this Resolution.<br><br>Corollarily, the Resolution of 26 September 1994 directed at the National Bureau of Investigation is ordered RECALLED for having been rendered academic by the denial of the petition and the suspension of Atty. Villanueva.<br><br>Let copies of this Resolution be attached to his personal record and circulated among all the different courts throughout the country.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Quiason,</i> and <i>Kapunan, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Resolution reads: "It appearing that Atty. Alfredo Z. Villanueva, counsel for petitioner, failed to file reply to the comment on the petition for review on certiorari as required in the resolution of April 11, 1994 within the extended period which expired on May 23, 1994, the Court Resolved to DIRECT the Director, National Bureau of Investigation, to ARREST Atty. Alfredo Z. Villanueva and COMMIT him into prison until he shall have complied with the filing of said reply" (<span style="font-style: italic;">see Rollo</span>, p. 80).<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <span style="font-style: italic;">Santos v.
