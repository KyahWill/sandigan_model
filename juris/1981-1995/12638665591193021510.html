of the Court of First Instance of South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>,
Branch I dated April 22, 1982 in Civil Case No. 1291 which, among others,

registered absolute owners of Lot No. <span style="">4
and ordered the petitioner to deliver to the private respondents the property

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case as <span style="">found by the </span><span style="">appellate
court are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiffs-spouses are native <span class="SpellE">muslims</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to 1952, <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span> bought a parcel of land with an area of 54,.4980
hectares, more or less, situated at <span class="SpellE">Makar</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(using the money given to her by her parents) from vendors <span class="SpellE">Cosin</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bentaib</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hadji</span> <span class="SpellE">Abdaua</span> <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The land was, however, surveyed in the name
of <span class="SpellE">Bangon</span> Yu (father of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Yu) on <st1:date year="1952" day="14" month="6">June 14 to 16, 1952</st1:date>
by private surveyor <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Mendoza which was
approved by the Director of Lands on <st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="3">March
 4, 1953</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1953" day="11" month="9">September 11 to 12, 1953</st1:date>, the land
was sub­divided into five (5) lots in another survey conducted and executed by <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> Mendoza, and approved by the Director of Lands on <st1:date year="1954" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1954</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subdivision was as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lot No. 1 for <span class="SpellE">Bengon</span>
Yu; Lot No. 2 for <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Yu; Lot No 3 for <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> <span class="SpellE">Pinag­awang</span>; Lot No. 4
for <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span> <span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span> and
Lot No. 5 for <span class="SpellE">Ison</span> Yu (the brother of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Yu).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A")</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Yu, together with his
wife, <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span> <span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span>
filed on December 21, their respective Free Patent Application for both Lot
Nos. 4 and 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1961</st1:date>, the approval of the Director of
Lands of the Free Patent Application, Free Patent No. V­-178889 was issued on <st1:date year="1961" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1961</st1:date> by authority of the
President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon transmittal to the Register of Deeds on <st1:date year="1961" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1961</st1:date>, the latter issued to <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Yu, married to <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span>, Original Certificate of Title No.
(C-14496) (P-523) on <st1:date year="1961" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1961</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B"), "B-1" and
"BB").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner's copy of
said title, however, was not received by the patentee <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Yu because the same <span style="">was </span>given to
defendant John Z. <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> (now deceased).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In 1958, on account of jealousy, <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span>
<span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span> left her husband at <span class="SpellE">Tocanabago</span>,
General Santos, <st1:place>South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>,
where they had a house in the land in question since their marriage and lived
with her parents at <span class="SpellE">Baluan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the same period, <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Yu lived in <span class="SpellE">Tupi</span>, <st1:place>South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They reconciled, however, in 1963 and since then lived together in <span class="SpellE">Buluan</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon their reconciliation, however, <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
Yu asked his wife if a certain Alfonso Non had approached her regarding the
sale of <span style="">their </span>land <span style="">to </span>John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span> <span class="SpellE">Matualaga</span> answered in the negative and further said that
she never executed any instrument conveying her property to anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> Yu then
explained that while they were separated, Alfonso Non approached him and told
him that there was a buyer interested in their land at a price of P200.00 per
hectare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
told Non that the land belonged to his wife as her <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>
property, hence, he did not have authority to sell the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alfonso Non, however, convinced <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> that if he would only sign the documents which Non
had prepared then Non will secure the signature of <span class="SpellE">Talinanap</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Buluan</span>, and if Non fails to get <span class="SpellE">Talinanap's</span> <span style="">signature,
</span>then <span class="SpellE">Melencio's</span> signature will be null and
void. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>With such understanding, <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> signed the "Agreement of Transfer of Rights
and Deed of Sale" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B") and the
"Quitclaim Deed" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D"),
without receiving any consideration therefore.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It turned out that the deeds involved the sale at the whole parcel of
land consisting of more than 54 hectares in favor of John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>
for a consideration of P9,500.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By reason of these information, the spouses sought the
assistance of the Commission on National Integration of Southern Mindanao
office which informed them that their original certificate of titles were taken
and delivered to John <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> by virtue of the sale
documents in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs demanded the return of their land to them and the
declaration of nullity of the documents in question." (pp. 45-46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 6, 1986 private respondents filed a complaint against
John Z. <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span> (later <span class="SpellE">substitued</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="6"><span style="">June 21, </span>1973</st1:date>,
the trial court issued its order dismissing the case on the ground of

motion for reconsideration to set aside the order dated <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1973</st1:date> which was denied on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Court<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of Appeals, Special Eighth Division, rendered

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition is devoid of

<p class="BODY">Section 145 of the Revised Administrative Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> provides that any transaction involving real property

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.2in;">Section 120 of the
Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141) provides that conveyances and
encumbrances made by persons belonging to the so-called "non Christian

is able to read and can understand the language in which the instrument of
conveyance or encumbrance is written.<span style="">&nbsp;
