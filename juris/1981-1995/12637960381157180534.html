<p class="BODY">The case involves a coconut plantation located at <st1:city><st1:place>San

(5) hectares, owned by petitioner Lorenzo Hernandez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dagli</span>
works on the said landholding and an old copra <span style="">kiln converted into a modest house served as his living quarters in the
plantation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Sometime in 197</span>1,<span style=""> </span>the petitioner sought to evict <span style="">the private respondent from the premises in a

enforcement of his alleged </span>right of <span style="">security of tenure on the ground that he is </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">tenant on the coconut plantation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner denied the </span>existence <span style="">of a tenancy relationship between them.<span style="">&nbsp;

<blockquote>"The main question involved in this appeal is with regard to
the real status of the plaintiff-appellant who worked (on) the coconut
landholding in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is he a tenant
or a hired farm laborer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are facts and cir­cumstances on record which clearly

the Court of Appeals denied the petitioner's plea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portions of the said Resolution
are as follows --</p>

<blockquote>"The circumstances surrounding the stay of the
Plaintiff-Appellant on the land in question such as the kind of work that he
performed and the fact that the land in question was formerly a subject of
tenancy relationship between his parents and the Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>
show indubitably that the Plaintiff-Appellant is a tenant on the land and not a
mere laborer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> motion has quoted the testimony of the carpenter
who constructed the house where the Plaintiff-Appellant lives x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"According to the testimony of the carpenter, it was the
Plaintiff-Appellant who ordered the construction of the house and was the one
who paid him at P4.00 a day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Plaintiff-Appellant was a mere hired laborer, it would be illogical for him to
build a house x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (on)
the said property and spend for the building (thereof) at his own expense for
as a hired laborer he can be dismissed at any time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He will be risking therefore his investment
on the house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court takes judicial notice that in most instances x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (where) the worker, say in a
hacienda, has to live on the land, the landowner usually is the one who
provides the housing facilities and<span style=""> </span>not
the worker himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bunkhouses are
always built by the landowners for their hired hands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"FOR ALL OF THE FOREGOING, this Court is more convinced that
the Plaintiff-Appellant is a tenant of the Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>

Thereafter, the parties filed their respective briefs and the case was

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the record of the case, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the instant Petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the time this litigation was initiated, the defunct Court of
Agrarian Relations had the exclusive jurisdiction over agrarian relations

Thereafter, the Decision of the Court of Appeals may be brought to this Court

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that the question of whether or not the
challenged Decision of the Court of Appeals is supported by the <span class="GramE">evidence,</span> is a question of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent claims otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the claim of the petitioner that the Court of Appeals
arrived at erroneous conclusions based on the findings of facts of the agrarian
court, the Court of Appeals ma<span style="">d</span>e
its own findings of<span style=""> </span>facts apart
from that of the agrarian court, so that its <span style="">conclusions </span>were based on its own factual findin<span style="">g</span>s.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Santa Ana, Jr. v. Hernandez</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice <span style="">J.
</span>B. L. Reyes, made the following pronouncement --</p>

<blockquote>"The credibility of witnesses and the weighing of conflicting
evidence are matters within the exclusive authority of the Court of Appeals,
and it is not necess<span style="">arily </span>bound
by the conclusions of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both the Judiciary Act… and the Rules of Court (Rule 45, section 2) only
allow a review of decisions of the Court of Appeals on questions of law; and
numerous decisions of this Court have invariably and re­peatedly held that
findings of fact by the Court of Appeals are conclusive and not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> by the Supreme Court … Barring, therefore, a
showing that the findings complained of are totally devoid of support in the
record, or that they are so glaringly erroneous as to constitute serious abuse
of discretion, such findings must stand, for this Court is not expected or
required to examine and contrast the oral and documentary evidence submitted by<span style=""> </span>the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by former Chief Justice Moran
in his Comments on the Rules of Court …, the law creating the Court of Appeals
was intended mainly to take away from the Supreme Court the work of examining
the evidence, and confine its task for the determination of questions which do
not call for the reading and study of transcripts con<span style="">taining the testimony of witnesses."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum, therefore, this Court does not re-examine the facts of
the case in a Petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> under Rule 45, except for
unusual reasons which would justify otherwise.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The review sought by the petitioner is not justified under any of
the grounds provided in Section 4, Rule 45 which would allow such review, to
wit --</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the Court of
Appeals has decided a question of substance, not theretofore determined by the
Supreme Court, or has decided it in a way probably not in accord with law or
with the applicable decisions of the Supreme Court;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b<span class="GramE">)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When</span>
the Court of Appeals has so far departed from the accepted and usual course of
judicial proceedings, or so far sanctioned such departure by<span style=""> </span>a lower court, as to call for an exercise
of the power of super<span style="">vision."</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this observation notwithstanding, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are convinced that the challenged Decision upholding the existence of a tenancy
relationship, and the Order denying a reconsideration of the same appear to be
justified on the basis of the findings of facts and <span style="">reasons </span>relied upon by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not based on mere speculation,
surmises or conjecture as petitioner represents.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of his contention, the petitioner cites the
pronouncements of this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dauan</u></span><u> v.

<p class="BODY">We have gone through these two cases relied upon by the
petitioner and <span class="GramE">We</span> are convinced that they do not
support his stand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Dauan</u></span> case involves a
homestead application filed as early as February 1935 relating to a <span style="">sizeable</span> parcel of land <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Vizcaya</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the records </span>of the application had been lost
during the last world war.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Years later,
a dispute arose between the original homestead applicant and some third parties
over the homestead application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The main
issue in the controversy was whether or not the homestead application had been
approved by the Government before the outbreak of World War II.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of the Bureau of Lands held that the homestead
application had not been approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
Decision was subsequently affirmed by the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the homestead
applicant challenged the Decision of the Secretary before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
and prevailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case eventually
reached this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the issues raised in the controversy was whether or not
the trial court could review the Decision of the Secretary even if the same was
not elevated to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled that
it was un­necessary to exhaust the available administrative remedy inasmuch as
the conclusion of the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources was
"drawn from the facts" of the case and is, therefore, "a
conclusion of law which the courts may review".</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion of the Secretary was based on the available
evidence which did not appear to be <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> by
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, there
is a conflict between the material allegations of both parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the assailed conclusion in <span class="SpellE"><u>Dauan</u></span> is that of an officer of the executive
department of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
instant controversy, the questioned conclusion is that of the Court of Appeals
-- a court of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The inapplicabi­lity
of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dauan</u></span> ruling to the case at bar is,
therefore, patent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Silverio</u></span> ruling refers to an
election case where the issue was the proper appreciation of a number of
ballots cast in the 1963 election for local governments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailed conclusion was that of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, a conclusion drawn from <u><span style="">undisputed</span></u><span style=""> </span>facts, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., the appearance of the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the facts are <u>not</u> <u><span style="">undisputed</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The inapplicability of
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Silverio</u></span> ruling to the case at bar <span style="">is, </span>therefore, likewise potent.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the guidance of the Bench and the Bar, the distinction
between a question of law and a question of fact is explained in <span class="GramE">Our</span> pronouncement in <u>Ramos v. </u><u><span style="">Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co.</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to </span>wit --</p>

them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the distinction is
well-known:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a question of law
in a given case when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a
certain state of facts; there is a question of fact when the doubt arises as to
the truth or the false­hood of alleged facts."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying this principle to the case at bar, a conclusion of the
