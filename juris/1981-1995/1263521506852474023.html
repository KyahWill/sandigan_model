This is a petition to review the resolution of respondent National Labor
 Relations Commission (NLRC) dated January 20, 1982, which dismissed the
 petitioner's appeal on the ground that it was filed beyond the 
reglementary period.
<p>
Private respondent Rodolfo Yanguas started working with respondent 
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company on January 22, 1951.  He rose
 from the ranks until he reached the position of Cable Foreman SJG-2 
sometime in July, 1972.
</p><p>
On September 20, 1980, private respondent Yanguas was informed that he 
would be placed under preventive suspension effective October 1, 1980, 
leading to dismis­sal, pending clearance from the Ministry of Labor and 
Employment for incompetence and inefficiency in the performance of 
assigned duties.
</p><p>
On September 23, 1980, petitioner company filed with the Ministry of 
Labor and Employment an application to terminate the services of private
 respondent on the above-mentioned grounds.
</p><p>
The facts and incidents which led the employer to file an application to
 terminate Yangua's employment are summarized in the Labor Arbiter's 
decision as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "As Cable Foreman SJ-2, complainant herein had employees under his
 supervision.  One of these PLDT employees was Vicente Rebong, who, 
along with other three co-workers were (sic) arrested and detained for 
qualified theft. </p>
  <p> "After due investigation conducted by respondent Company, it was 
found out that Vicente Rebong was able to engage in the buying and 
selling of stolen PLDT communications materials and equipment by leaving
 his job and work assignments almost everyday. </p>
  <p> "Respondent Company now alleges that complainant, instead of 
stopping Vicente Rebong and calling the latter's attention to these 
absences, he openly credited Vicente Rebong with full and complete 
attendance on those days when Rebong was, in truth, absent from his work
 assignment. </p>
  <p> "Respondent further alleges that "by such gross and criminal 
negligence in the performance of his supervisory duties and functions, 
complainant, in effect, collaborated with Vicente Rebong in:  (1) giving
 the latter the opportunity to buy and sell stolen company property and 
equipment during official work hours; and (2) falsifying the time 
records of Vicente Rebong by crediting him with full attendance in the 
latter's daily time report when the truth is Vicente Rebong was absent 
from his place of work assignment. </p>
  <p> "Complainant Yanguas, on the other hand, maintains that the 
respondent has no legal and moral basis in branding him as incompetent 
and inefficient in the performance of his assigned duties; that it is 
sufficient to consider the period he had worked with respondent P.L.D.T.
 and the performance of his duties as a Cable Foreman SJG- 2 for several
 years, in order to negate the claim of the respondent; and that the 
dismissal was anchored on some other motive or motives, particularly, 
avoidance of payment of retirements pay and/or other benefits to the 
complainant on the part of the respondent."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On October 15, 1980, the private respondent, in turn, filed with the 
Ministry of Labor and Employment, Regional Office No. IV a complaint 
against petitioner company for illegal dismissal and illegal suspension.
  This complaint also served as an opposition to the peti­tioner's 
application for clearance to terminate him.
</p><p>
On March 16, 1981 Labor Arbiter Mirasol Corleto rendered a decision 
finding "that the negligence of the complainant is not a sufficient 
cause of this dismissal and that such penalty of dismissal is too harsh 
and too severe".  The Labor Arbiter further ruled that since Yanguas is 
no longer seeking reinstatement but only payment of his retirement 
benefits and considering that he had been with petitioner company for 
twenty nine (29) years and eight (8), and four (4) more months, and 
therefore, would have been eligible for optional retirement under 
company rules and policies, it is but fair and just that Yanguas be 
allowed to retire with retirement benefits.  Under Article 6 of the 
Benefit Plan of the petitioner company, an employee who had completed 
twenty five (25) years of service, is entitled to benefits computed as 
provided in the plan.
</p><p>
Consequently, the Labor Arbiter issued the clearance for petitioner 
company to terminate the services of Yanguas but ordered the petitioner 
within ten (10) working days from receipt of the decision to pay the sum
 of Ninety Four Thousand Fifty Pesos (P94,050.00) retirement benefits to
 Rodolfo Yanguas.
</p><p>
On March 23, 1981, notice was served upon petitioner at its Makati Main 
Office by leaving a copy of the decision with the clerk at the 
corporation's receiving section who acknowledged receipt thereof.  It 
was only on March 26, 1981 that petitioner company's counsel on record, 
Atty. Jesus F. Villarroya, received notice when the copy of the decision
 was given to the receiving clerk of the Legal Services Division of the 
petitioner company.
</p><p>
On April 10, 1981, the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company 
appealed to the respondent NLRC only with respect to that portion of the
 decision awarding retirement benefits to the private respondent.
</p><p>
On January 20, 1982, the respondent NLRC dismissed the petitioner's 
appeal on the ground that it was filed beyond the reglementary period of
 appeal.  The Commission ruled that the tenth working day within which 
to file the subject appeal fell on April 8, 1981 since the March 16, 
1981 decision of the Labor Arbiter was received by the petitioner on 
March 23, 1981.
</p><p>
Petitioner assigns a lone error for the grant of this petition, alleging that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "RESPONDENT NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION COMMITTED GRAVE 
ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHEN IT DISMISSED PETITIONER'S APPEAL FOR ALLEGED 
FAILURE FILE THE SAID APPEAL WITHIN THE REGLEMENTARY PERIOD 
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THE DECISION WHICH WAS CITED AS THE BASIS FOR 
THE DENIAL OF THE APPEAL WAS NOT PROPERLY SERVED ON THE PETITIONER."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The only issue is the timeliness of the appeal filed with the respondent
 National Labor Relations Commission.  From what date should the ten 
(10) days period to appeal be computed.
</p><p>
Petitioner argues that the receipt of the decision on March 23, 1981, 
cannot form the basis for the computation of the period to appeal 
because the copy of the decision was served on the Philippine Long 
Distance Telephone Company itself, and not on its counsel on record, 
Atty. Jesus F. Villarroya.  Petitioner submits that the decision of the 
Labor Arbiter was served only on March 26, 1981 thru the receiving clerk
 of the Legal Services Division where the counsel works.  Computed from 
March 26, 1981, the petitioner's ten (10) working days within which to 
perfect its appeal to the respondent Commission expired on April 13, 
1981.
</p><p>
Respondents on the other hand argue that since the petitioner company 
received the said notice of the decision on March 23, 1981, and the 
petitioner's counsel works in the same building, the ten (10) day 
reglementary period for appeal started from March 23, 1981.  Respondents
 submit that service of the notice of the decision of the Labor Arbiter 
with a copy of the decision addressed to "Atty Jesus F. Villarroya, 
counsel for respondent, 9th Floor PLDT Building, Makati, Metro Manila", 
at the petitioner's receiving section, at the ground floor of the said 
PLDT building was valid service for purposes of computing the period to 
appeal.
</p><p>
Section 2, Rule 13 of the Revised Rules of Court reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 2.  <em>PAPERS TO BE FILED AND SERVED</em>.  - Every order 
required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the 
complaint, every writ­ten motion other than one which may be heard <em>ex parte</em>,
 and every written notice, appearance, demand, offer of judgment or 
similar papers shall be filed with the Court, and served upon the 
parties affected thereby.  <em>If any of such parties has appeared by an attorney or attorneys, service upon him shall</em> <em>be made upon his attorneys or one of them, unless service upon the himself is ordered by the Court.</em>" xxx.  (Italics is supplied) </p>
  <p> Under the above provision, it is clear that service of notice, 
pleadings, orders, and the like, should be made on the party, if not 
represented by counsel (Elli v. Ditan, 1 SCRA 503) and when a party is 
represented by counsel, notice should be made upon the counsel.  Notice 
upon the party himself, is not considered in law unless service upon the
 party is ordered by the Court.  The term "every written notice" 
includes notice of decisions or orders.' (<em>Jalover v. Ytoriaga</em>, 80 SCRA 100). </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    The notice of the decision dated March 20, 1981 signed by Virgel R. 
 Velasco, Stenographic Reporter was served by the Bailiff upon 
petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company at the ground 
floor of its building on March 23, 1981.  The bailiff's return dated 
March 24, 1981 reads:
  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
      PLDT MAKATI
    </p>
    <p>
      Mar. 23. RECD.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
and below the words "Mar. 23 RECD" is the signature of the receiving 
clerk.  The said notice of decision clearly shows that the address of 
record of Atty. Villarroya, petitioner's counsel is "9th Floor PLDT 
Bldg., Makati, Metro Manila." (Annex A-1, Reply).
</p><p>
The bailiff, instead of serving the notice of the decision at the lawyer
 on the ninth floor which is clearly indicated in the notice of 
decision, left the notice at the ground floor of the petitioner's main 
building.  We have held time and again that notices to counsel should 
properly be sent to the address of record in the absence of due notice 
to the court of change of address (<em>Phil. Suburban Dev. Corp. v. Court of Appeals</em>,
 100 SCRA 109).  Hence, practical considerations and the realities of 
the situation dictate that the service made by the bailiff on March 23, 
1981 at the ground floor of the petitioner's building and not at the 
address of record of petitioner's counsel on record at the 9th floor of 
the PLDT building cannot be considered a valid service.  It was only 
when the Legal Services Division actually received a copy of the 
decision on March 26, 1981 that a proper and valid service may be deemed
 to have been made.  The notice of decision received by the Legal 
Services Division of peti­tioner company has the following markings:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    LEGAL SERVICES DIVISION
  </p>
  <p>
    RECEIVED
  </p>
  <p>
    cpp                            3/26/81
  </p>
  <p>
    PLDTCo.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    In <em>Alimpoos v. Court of Appeals</em>, (106 SCRA 159), we held:
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> "x x x under the circumstances therefore, reliance may be placed 
on the assertion of counsel that the offended party, Eliseo Alimpoos, 
had given him a copy of the ORDER only on April 4, 1966, which must be 
deemed as the date of notice to said counsel of the order."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The purpose of the rule is obviously to maintain a uniform procedure 
calculated to place in competent hands the orderly prosecution of a 
party's case.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x This rule is not a mere technical­ity, but one founded on 
considerations of fair play.  A party engages an attorney of record 
precisely because it does not feel competent to deal with the 
intri­cacies of law and procedure.  Furthermore, as the party directly 
served would have to communicate with its attorney and turn over to him 
the notice received, the net result would be to noticeably shorten the 
usable period for taking the proper steps required to protect the 
party's interests." (<em>J.M. Javier Logging Corporation v. Mardo</em>, 24 SCRA 776). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In modern multistoried buildings, there may be several hundred rooms 
with hundreds of different employees discharging different functions.  A
 receiving clerk in a given mailing section may not know the difference 
between a notice to a lawyer and the thousands of other communications 
received by her either by mail or through personal or commercial 
messengers and may not act accordingly.  Service upon a lawyer must be 
effected at the exact given address of the lawyer and not in the 
vicinity or at a general receiving section for an entire multi-storied 
building with many offices.
</p><p>
It is apparent therefore that respondent National Labor Relations 
Commission committed error in holding that the appeal was interposed 
beyond the reglementary period.  The March 23, 1981 service cannot be 
deemed as notice in law to petitioner.  The ten (10) working days within
 which to perfect an appeal should be com­puted from March 26, 1981.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the resolution of respondent National Labor Relations 
Commission dated March 16, 1981 is hereby set aside and the respondent 
Commission is ordered to give due course to the petitioner company's 
appeal in NLRC Case No. 10-8864-80.  The temporary restraining order 
issued on April 14, 1982 enjoining the respondents from enforcing the 
resolution dated January 20, 1982 is made permanent.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, (Acting Chairman), Plana, Relova </em>and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J.,</em> on leave.
