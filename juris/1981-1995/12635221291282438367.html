This is an automatic review of the decision dated August 19, 1977 of the
 then Court of First Instance of Ilocos Norte in Criminal Case No. 78-IV
 imposing the death penalty on Oliver S. Tajon and ordering him to 
indemnify the heirs of Exequiel Lucero in the sum of P12,000.00, plus 
the amount of P1,591.00 representing mortuary and funeral expenses, and 
to pay the costs.
<p>
The evidence of the prosecution shows that about 6:30 in the evening of 
October 27, 1971, Exequiel Lucero, Roman Balgos, Romeo Balgos and Primo 
Campos were standing at the junction of the municipal road, barrio No. 
1, Canaan, Badoc, Ilocos Norte.  Accused Oliver S. Tajon, armed with a 
short firearm approached Exequiel Lucero and without saying a word, 
suddenly grabbed the collar of Lucero's shirt and immediately shot him 
on the forehead, left breast and left arm in rapid succession.  Tajon, 
at the time was accompanied by Pepito Ladera and Romeo Corpuz who were 
armed with a short and a long firearm, respectively.
</p><p>
Peace officers Alfredo Cala and Patrolman Godofredo Rañon arrived upon 
being summoned and they saw the victim, Exequiel Lucero, prostrate on 
the ground still breathing.  Near his body were three (3) empty shells 
of a .32 caliber firearm.  However, when asked who his assailant was, 
Lucero could not talk and was unable to answer the query of Sgt. Cala.  
With the help of some people around, the victim was brought to the 
clinic of Dr. Amador Corpuz who, after conducting a preliminary 
examination, caused his transfer to the adjoining town of Sinait, Ilocos
 Sur.  He was dead upon arrival at the bigger clinic of Dr. Corpuz.  
Autopsy report shows that Exequiel Lucero suffered the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.  Wound, gunshot, through and through, entrance .6 x .6 cm; 6.5
 cm above the eyebrow, 4 cm. to the sagittal line of the head, left 
side. </p>
  <p>
    2.   Wound, gunshot, through and through, entrance .6 x .6 cm., 5 cm
 above the cubital fossa of the elbow on the antero lateral aspect of 
the forearm, left side.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.   Wound, gunshot, through and through, exit of wound No. 2, .6 x 
.6 cm., 6 cm above the cubital fossa of the elbow on medial aspect of 
the forearm, left side.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.   Wound, gunshot, through and through, exit of wound No. 1, 1 x 
1.5 cm., 4.5 cm below vault of the skull just on the sagittal line, left
 side.
  </p>
  <p> 5.   Wound, gunshot, re-entrance of wound No. 2, .6 x .6 cm., 1.5 
cm behind the entero-axillary line, between the 7th and 8th rib. 12.5 cm
 below armpit, left side." (p. 4, Appellee's Brief) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Dr. Arzadon testified that Exequiel Lucero's death was due to hemorrhage as a result of gunshot wounds.
</p><p>
Further, evidence shows that on October 24, 1971 or three (3) days 
before the incident, Lucero, nephew and political campaigner of Benjamin
 Coloma who was running against incumbent Mayor Angel Bautista of Badoc,
 Ilocos Norte was threatened by accused Oliver S. Tajon, bodyguard and 
political follower of Mayor Bautista.
</p><p>
Defense evidence is alibi.  Tajon denied being the assailant of Lucero, 
his childhood mate, because about 6:30 in the evening of October 27, 
1971 he was at Badoc Municipal Building calling for Atty. Gines via the 
police radio communication network.  His uncle Abundio Gines was with 
him and he even saw Pat. Godofredo Rañon, Jr. in front of the municipal 
building on his way to fetch Sgt. Alfredo Cala to tell the latter about 
the shooting of Exequiel Lucero.  The two, Pat. Rañon and Sgt. Cala went
 to the municipal building first before they left for the scene of the 
crime.  He denied the truth of the testimonies of Roman Balgos and Romeo
 Balgos that he held the collar of the shirt of Lucero before the latter
 was shot and claimed that mayoralty candidate Benjamin Coloma directed 
Roman and Romeo Balgos to point him out as the assailant.  Finally, he 
denied having seen, much less met Exequiel Lucero that evening of 
October 27, 1971.
</p><p>
The trial court, in convicting appellant Oliver S. Tajon of the crime of murder, said -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x [T]his Court is inclined to believe the version of the 
People to be the truth, for the State's witnesses testified in clear, 
straightforward, positive and convincing manner regarding the audacious 
shooting to death (like a public execution and in the presence of his 
teenager companions Primo, Roman and Romeo) of the late Exequiel Lucero 
at the cross-roads that unfortunate evening of Oct. 27, 1971, some 300 
meters away from the Badoc Municipal Hall.  No convincing motive was 
shown by the defense why eye-witnesses Roman Balgos and Romeo Balgos 
would testify falsely against accused imputing to him the heinous crime 
of snuffing the life of an 18-year old boy and in a treacherous manner. 
 That victim, Roman and Romeo, were living in the same house and are 
relatives are not questioned, but this fact does not prevent the court 
in having reliance in their testimonies as they are very credible 
witnesses.  Their narration of the execution of Exequiel by herein 
accused impudently made in their presence, the suddenness of the act 
electrifying them into immobility like voiceless ciphers, were 
immediately relayed, first to their relatives and then to the 
authorities and without any delay; hence, no time to concoct their story
 to suit State's interest.  Their statements partake of the nature of 
Res Gestae explaining the facts in issue, for they are sufficiently 
contemporaneous with the act that they accompany and explain (Topacio 
vs. Paredes, 23 Phil. 255); that the account of the instant killing is 
the offspring of the facts speaking through the party talking about the 
facts, when the human mind taken aback by the suddenness of the event 
has automatically expressed itself through the tongue and neither had 
the opportunity to fabricate (People vs. Umblas, 5 C.A.R. (2s) 1234).  
On the other hand, herein accused cannot be relied upon as a believable 
witness because his version contradicts that of his corroborating 
witness Jaime Calaycay.  For instance, while Jaime claims that Pepito 
Ladera was also with them, herein accused insists that said Ladera was 
not with them at the POLCOM in the office of the Badoc Police Chief; 
while Jaime states that he was called by Abundio Gines to his house and 
on the way he saw accused about 6 P.M., October 27, 1971, infront of the
 house of Mayor Angel Bautista just across the street, accused on the 
other hand says that said Jaime arrived at Abundio's house where he 
(accused) also stays at 3:00 that afternoon; that while they negotiated 
walking the some 300 meters distance from Abundio's house to the 
municipal building for about ten (10) minutes, accused Oliver asserts 
that it took them to walk that distance of about a kilometer from house 
to municipal building one and a half (1½ ) hours; that while accused 
testified that Abundio wanted to send message to one Noling Gines in 
Dingras, Ilocos Norte, Jaime's version was that Abundio wanted to have 
contact with Atty. Manoling Corrales at Dingras, and about a fighting 
cock they wanted to match in the cockpit.  Incidentally, Exh. 'I-1' of 
the Dingras POLCOM Log Book contains the message 'Come Badoc on Sunday. 
 This is very urgent.' The matter about the fighting cock is not at all 
mentioned.  Besides, this corroborating witness (Jaime) is also a biased
 witness considering that the father of accused's wife Delia and the 
former's are brothers.  Jaime's declaration therefore, cannot be given 
credence, as he is a close relative and as such is naturally inclined to
 give the testimony confirming accused's assertions.  These 
contradictions above-referred to by the way are on material points; it 
being so, they cannot be relied upon.  As a rule, a witness may be said 
to be a biased one when his relation to the cause or to the parties is 
such that he has an incentive to exaggerate or give false color to his 
statements or to suppress or prevent the truth or to state that is false
 (PP. vs. Watin, 67 O.G. 590).  Another rule, is that contradictions in 
the testimony of witness may render his testimony worthless (Mondragon 
vs. CA, et al., Dec. 1974, S.C.D., page 224 and other cases too numerous
 to cite).  Applying the above precepts, the Court cannot find reliance 
on Jaime and accused, for their versions are based on contradictions and
 vacillation.  The defense of Alibi must be convincing and to the 
satisfaction of the Court and not based on 'contradictions' and 
'vacillations' as in the instant case." (pp. 95-97, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Appellant's defense is untenable in its transparent flimsiness and weak 
character.  The clear and convincing evidence of the prosecution on the 
felonious shooting perpetrated by accused-appellant Oliver S. Tajon may 
be taken as conclusive.  His guilt has been established beyond 
reasonable doubt.  Roman Balgos testified on the identity of accused 
appellant Tajon, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "FISCAL - </p>
  <p>
    Q    If Oliver Tajon is here now, will you point to him?

<p>
On the other hand, defense evidence of alibi is the weakest of all the 
defenses in view of the ease with which it is concocted; it cannot 
prevail over the positive identification of appellant by the prosecution
 witnesses.
</p><p>
The crime committed by appellant Tajon is murder, qualified by treachery
 as alleged in the information.  There was treachery because appellant 
made a deliberate surprise and unexpected assault on Exequiel Lucero.  
When appellant emerged from the dark, rushed in front of his victim, 
suddenly grabbed his collar and shot his forehead, left breast and left 
arm in rapid succession, Lucero was completely unaware of what would 
happen to him.  Stated differently, the victim was caught flatfooted and
 was not in a position to put up a defense against the unforeseen 
assault upon him.  The fact that the attack was frontal does not negate 
the presence of <em>alevosia </em>considering that the victim was shot in a defenseless situation.
</p><p>
We agree with the submission of the Solicitor General that the 
prosecution has failed to show that evident premeditation was present.  
The affidavit of the victim made three days before the incident purports
 to show that it was Pepito Ladera who actually threatened him and it is
 noteworthy that Ladera was not held responsible for the death of 
Lucero.  This lack in evidence for the prosecution precludes the finding
 that evident premeditation was proved beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
Likewise, We are in accord with the stand of the Solicitor General that 
the lower court erred in treating the circumstance of abuse of superior 
strength as a separate and distinct aggravating circumstance because it 
is deemed absorbed in the qualifying circumstance of treachery and is 
inherent in the same.  For superior strength to aggravate a crime, it 
must be clearly shown that there was deliberate intent to take advantage
 of it (People vs. Bello 10 SCRA 298).  Further, abuse of superior 
strength is absorbed by <em>alevosia </em>or treachery (People vs. Layson, 30 SCRA 92)
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the judgment of the trial court is modified in the sense 
that appellant Oliver S. Tajon is sentenced to reclusion perpetua and is
 ordered to pay the heirs of Exequiel Lucero in the sum of P30,000.00 as
 indemnity, plus the amount of P1,591.00 representing mortuary and 
funeral expenses, and to pay the costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
