of Court, the petitioners (86 security guards) assail:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
order dated <st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1990</st1:date>
of the National Labor Relations Commission, 5th Division, denying their
petition for a <span style="">writ </span>of
injunction to stop the <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Development
Corporation (SUDECOR) from terminating their services on <st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The NLRC held that the petition was moot and academic as their dismissal
from the service of SUDECOR had become a <u><span style="">fait</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>accompli</u>
(Annex A, Petition); and</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
order of <st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1990</st1:date>
denying their motion for reconsideration and remanding the records of the case
to the Arbitration Branch for further proceedings (Annex B).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="10"><span style="">October
 11, 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
petitioners filed in the Department of Labor and Employment Regional Office XI
a letter-complaint charging SUDECOR with violations of labor standards, by not
paying them overtime pay, </span><span style="">rest </span><span style="">day pay, holiday pay, night differentials,
daily camping allowance, not providing them with safety devices and housing,
and by illegally dismissing some employees (NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">RAB-11-04-00277-89).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="4"><span style="">April
 12, 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
Regional Director indorsed the case to the Regional Arbitration Branch of the
NLRC because an issue arose as to whether the complainants (herein petitioners)
were employees of SUDECOR.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1990" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23,
 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
petitioners, anticipating their mass dismissal at the end of that month, filed
with the NLRC a telegraphic motion for issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction to stop the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
followed it up on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28, 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">with
</span><span style="">a supplemental complaint and
petition for preliminary injunction with prayer for the issuance of a temporary
restraining order which was received by the NLRC </span><span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As previously stated,
both the telegraphic and formal petitions for injunction were not acted upon
immediately by the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the time it
did on June 11, 19???0, the petitioners had already been laid off from their jobs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> minute
resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="6"><span style="">June 11, 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> stated that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After due deliberation, the Commission resolves to dismiss
the petition for injunction for being moot and academic, the action sought to
be enjoined had already transpired on May 31, 1990.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, the instant petition may be treated either as a
complaint for illegal dismissal and/or unfair labor practice (ULP) and the same
is remanded to the Regional Arbitration Branch for appropriate action." <span class="GramE">(Annex A, p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners received
the resolution on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="6"><span style="">June 14, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
filed </span>by <span style="">registered mail on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> a motion for
reconsideration with the NLRC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> which denied their motion
for tardiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of the NLRC resolution dated </span><st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="8"><span style="">August 24, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, received by the petitioners on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="9"><span style="">September
 14, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, reads as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the challenged order is upheld and the appeal
DISMISSED for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Motion
for Reconsideration is DENIED for having been filed beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Let the record of the instant cases be immediately remanded to the
Arbitration branch of origin for further proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Executive Labor Arbiter is directed to
submit a report on the action taken within fifteen (15) days from receipt of
the records of the cases." <span class="GramE">(pp. 52-53, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In their petition for <i>certiorari</i>
</span><span style="">in </span><span style="">this Court, the petitioners bitterly assail
the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> delay in resolving their application for a
temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They allege that since their telegraphic
motion was sent on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="23" month="5"><span style="">May 23, 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> and the supplemental motion was filed on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="28" month="5"><span style="">May 28,
 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, the NLRC had
enough time to issue a temporary restraining order to stop their wholesale
dismissal on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioners allege
that the NLRC erred in holding that their motion for reconsideration was filed
late because </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">pleading was </span><span style="">in fact </span><span style="">filed on the
tenth day of the ten-day period for appeal not "three (3) days out of
time." <span class="GramE">(p. 28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition for <i>certiorari</i>
has no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if the petitioners’
computation of the appeal period were correct, the NLRC committed no grave
abuse of discretion in denying their motion for reconsideration for, as a
matter of fact, the injunctive relief prayed for could not be granted because
the mass lay-offs which were sought to be enjoined, had already occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A writ of injunction cannot be issued against
consummated acts </span><span style="">(Ramos vs. </span><span style="">CA, G.R. No. 80908, May 24, 1989; <span class="SpellE">Aragones</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Subido</span>, 25 SCRA 95
[1968]; <span class="SpellE">Ramonte</span> </span><span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bonto</span></span><span style="">, 16 SCRA 257 [1960]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The failure of the NLRC
to act immediately on the application for injunction is not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In light of the
explanation given by the </span><span style="">Commission
in </span><span style="">its order of </span><st1:date year="1990" day="24" month="8"><span style="">August
 24, 1990</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="GramE">no grave abuse of discretion nor</span> excess of jurisdiction is
imputable to it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“In passing it should be stated here and now that the
regionalization of the Commission is by mandate of Republic Act 6715 which
amended the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
thereto, this Division of the Commission after months of <span style="">preparation </span>opened its doors <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City on <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time everything was in disarray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
records were not yet delivered by the shipping company at the warehouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioners who are not from the place
were still relocating their families.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
top it all, the staffing pattern intended for the Division Office was not yet
realized because of the lack of funding and the dearth of trained
personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Altogether, the Commission
could not be expected to perform miracles like acting on a telegraphic motion
for the issuance of a temporary restraining order, which to grant the same on
this basis <span style="">is </span>a procedural
risk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same is true with acting on a
petition for injunction with a prayer for the issuance of a temporary
restraining order to prevent the doing of <span style="">an
</span>act which is threatened to be done on the day following the date of its
filing." <span class="GramE"><span style="">(p. </span>52,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In any event, the petitioners are not bereft of <span style="">adequate remedies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their action for illegal </span>dismissal,
