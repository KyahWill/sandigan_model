EUTROPIO MIGRINO, AS PRESIDING JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, NCJR, BRANCH 15, PASIG, METRO MANILA AND TROADIO TECSON, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case puts in issue the authority of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG), through the New Armed Forces of the Philippines
Anti-Graft Board (hereinafter referred to <span style="">as </span>the “Board”), to investigate and cause the prosecution of
petitioner, a retired military officer, for violation of Republic Acts Nos.
3019 and 1379.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assailed by the Republic in this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and/or <i>mandamus</i> with prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order are the orders of
respondent judge in Civil Case No. 57092 Branch 151 of the Regional Trial Court
of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) dated June 23, 1989, denying petitioners’
Motion to Dismiss and Opposition, and (2) dated June 26, 1989, granting private
respondent’s application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petition seeks the
annulment of the two orders, the issuance of an injunction to enjoin respondent
judge from proceeding with Civil Case No. 57092 and, finally, the dismissal of
the case before the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy traces its roots to the order of then PCGG
Chairman <span class="SpellE">Jovito</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>,
dated <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1986</st1:date>, which
created the New Armed Forces of the Philippines Anti-Graft Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board was created to “investigate the
unexplained wealth and corrupt practices of AFP personnel, both retired and in
active service.” The order further stated that “[t]he Board shall be primarily
charged with the task of investigating cases of alleged violations of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act No. 3019, as amended) and <span style="">shall </span>make the necessary
recommendations to appropriate government agencies and instrumentalities with
respect to the action to be taken thereon based on its findings.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on information received by the Board, which indicated the
acquisition of wealth beyond his lawful income, private respondent Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Troadio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tecson</span> (ret.) was
required by the Board to submit his explanation/comment together with his
supporting evidence by October 31, 1987 [Annex “B”, Petition.] Private
respondent requested, and was granted, several postponements, but was unable to
produce his supporting evidence because they were allegedly in the custody of
his bookkeeper who had gone abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Just the same, the Board
proceeded with its investigation and submitted its resolution, dated </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30,
 1988</span></st1:date><span style="">, recommending
that private respondent be prosecuted and tried for violation of Rep. Act No.
3019, as amended, and Rep. Act No. 1379, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for preliminary investigation by the PCGG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent moved to dismiss the case on
the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the PCGG
has no jurisdiction over his person; (2) that the action against him under Rep.
Act No. 1379 has already prescribed; <span style="">(3)
that E.O. No. 14, insofar as it suspended the provisions of Rep. Act No. 1379
on prescription of actions, was inapplicable to his case; and (4) that having
retired from the AFP on May 9, 1984, he was now beyond the reach of Rep. Act
No. 3019.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board opposed the motion
to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="2">February
 8, 1989</st1:date>, the PCGG denied the motion to dismiss for lack of
merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent moved for
reconsideration but this was denied by the PCGG in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent was directed to submit his
counter-affidavit and other <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence on
<st1:date year="1989" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1989</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 p.m.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="3"><span style="">March
 13, 1989</span></st1:date><span style="">, private

the Regional Trial Court in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pasig</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, Metro Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Case No. 57092 and
raffled to Branch 151, respondent judge’s court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss and
opposed the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction on
the principal ground that the Regional Trial Court had no jurisdiction over the
Board, citing the case of </span><u><span style="">PCGG</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> <u>Pena</u>, G.R.
No. 77663, April 12, 1988, 159 SCRA 556.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="6">June<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>23, 1989</st1:date>, respondent judge denied
petitioner’s motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date>, respondent judge
granted the application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction,
enjoining petitioners from investigating or prosecuting private respondent
under Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379 upon the filing of a bond in the amount of
Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

and <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date> and from
proceeding with Civil Case No. 57092.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent filed his comment, to which petitioners filed
a reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rejoinder to the reply was
filed by private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
gave due course to the petition and the parties filed their memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case was deemed submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in the petition are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT JUDGE GRAVELY
ABUSED HIS DISCRETION OR ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ASSUMING
JURISDICTION OVER AND INTERFERING WITH THE ORDERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE
PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON GOOD GOVERNMENT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT JUDGE GRAVELY
ABUSED HIS DISCRETION OR ACTED WITHOUT OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN ISSUING
THE ASSAILED ORDER DATED JUNE 26, 1989 ENJOINING PETITIONERS FROM INVESTIGATING
AND PROSECUTING PRIVATE RESPONDENT FOR VIOLATION OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 3019,
OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ANTI-GRAFT AND CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND REPUBLIC ACT NO.
1379, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN ACT FOR THE FORFEITURE OF UNLAWFULLY ACQUIRED
PROPERTY [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the first issue, petitioner contends that following the
ruling of the Court in <u>PCGG</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Pena</u> the Board, being a
creation and/or extension of the PCGG, is beyond the jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the second
issue, petitioner strongly argues that the private respondent’s case falls
within the jurisdiction of the PCGG.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pivotal issue is the
second one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this point, private
respondent’s position is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . he is not one of the subordinates
contemplated in Executive Orders 1, 2, 14 and 14-A as the alleged illegal acts
being imputed to him, that of alleged amassing wealth beyond his legal means
while Finance Officer of the Philippine Constabulary, are acts of his own
alone, not connected with his being a crony, business associate, etc. or
subordinate as the petition does not allege so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence the PCGG has no jurisdiction to investigate him. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>If indeed private respondent amassed wealth beyond his legal means,
the procedure laid down by Rep. Act 1379 as already pointed out before be
applied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And since, he has been
separated from the government more than four years ago, the action against him
under Republic Act 1379 has already prescribed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . . no action can be filed anymore against
him now under Republic Act 1379 for recovery of unexplained wealth for the
reason that he has retired more than four years ago.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order creating the AFP Anti-Graft Board
(Annex “A”, Petition) is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nowhere in Executive Orders 1, 2, 14 and <span class="GramE">14-A is</span>
there any authority given to the commission, its chairman and members, to
create Boards or bodies to be invested with powers similar to the powers
invested with the commission. . . . [Comment, pp. 6-7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 117-118.]</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The</span> most important
question to be resolved in this case is whether or not private respondent may
be investigated and caused to be prosecuted by the Board, an agency of the
PCGG, for violation of Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioners, the PCGG has the
power to investigate and cause the prosecution of private respondent because he
is a “subordinate” of former President Marcos. They cite the <span class="SpellE">PCGG’s</span> jurisdiction over -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
recovery of all ill-gotten wealth accumulated by former President Ferdinand E.
Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, <b><u>subordinates</u></b> and close associates,
whether located in the Philippines or abroad, including the takeover or
sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by
them, <b><u>during</u> <u>his</u> <u>administration</u></b>, directly or
through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using
their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[E. O. No. 1, sec. <span style="">2.]<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, the alleged unlawful accumulation of wealth was done
during the administration of Pres. Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, what has to be inquired into is whether or not private
respondent acted as a “<b>subordinate</b>” of Pres. Marcos within the
contemplation of E.O. No. 1, the law creating the PCGG, when he allegedly
unlawfully acquired the properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">A close reading of E.O. No. 1 and related executive orders will
readily show what is contemplated within the term “subordinate.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The Whereas Clauses of E.O. No. 1 express the urgent need to
recover the ill-gotten wealth amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his
immediate family, relatives, and close associates both here and abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">E.O. No. 2 freezes “all assets and properties in the Philippines
in which former President Marcos and/or his wife, Mrs. Imelda <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> Marcos, their close relatives, subordinates,
business associates, dummies, agents, or nominees have any interest or
participation.”</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Applying the rule in
statutory construction known as <span class="SpellE"><u>ejusdem</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>generis</u></span>, that is -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>[W]here general words follow an enumeration of persons or things,
by words of a particular and specific meaning, such general words are not to be
construed in their widest extent, but are to be held as applying only to
persons or things of the same kind or class as those specifically mentioned
[Smith, Bell &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
96 Phil. 53, 58 (1954), citing Black on Interpretation of Laws, 2nd Ed., 203.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">the
term “subordinate” as used in E.O. Nos. 1 and 2 would refer to one who enjoys a
close association or relation with former Pres. Marcos and/or his wife, similar
to the immediate family member, relative, and close associate in E.O. No. 1 and
the close relative, business associate, dummy, agent, or nominee in E.O. No. 2.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, as stated by the
Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bataan</u></span> <u>Shipyard</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>Engineering</u>

<p class="BODY">It does not suffice, as in this case, that the respondent is or

Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
showing that the respondent unlawfully accumulated wealth by virtue of his
close association or relation with former Pres. Marcos and/or his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because otherwise the respondent’s
case will fall under existing general laws and procedures on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rep. Act No. 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt

[Sec. 2.] The Solicitor General shall file the petition and prosecute the case

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the record shows that private respondent was being

of the petition filed by private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Particularly, petitioner argues that the trial court cannot acquire
jurisdiction over the PCGG.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This matter
has already been settled in <u>Pena,</u> <u>supra,</u> where the Court ruled
that those who wish to question or challenge the <span class="SpellE">PCGG’s</span>
acts or orders must seek recourse in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
which is vested with exclusive and original jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan’s</span>
decisions and final orders are in turn subject to review on <i>certiorari</i>
exclusively by this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[<u>Ibid</u>,
at pp. 564-565.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The ruling in <u>Pena</u>

to enjoin the regional trial courts from interfering with the actions of the </span><span style="">PCGG.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge clearly acted without or in excess of his
jurisdiction when he took cognizance of Civil Case No. 57092 and issued the
writ of preliminary injunction against the <span style="">PCGG.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, we are confronted with a situation
wherein the <span style="">PCGG </span>acted in excess
of its jurisdiction and, hence, may be enjoined from doing so, but the court
that issued the injunction against the <span style="">PCGG
</span>has not been vested by law with jurisdiction over it and, thus, the
injunction issued was null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nullification of the assailed order<span style=""> </span>of respondent judge issuing the writ of preliminary injunction
is therefore in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
respondent judge must be enjoined from proceeding with Civil Case No. 57092.</p>

<p class="BODY">But in view of the patent lack of authority of the <span style="">PCGG </span>to investigate and cause the
prosecution of private respondent for violation of Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and
1379, the <span style="">PCGG </span>must also be
enjoined from proceeding with the case, without prejudice to any action that
may be taken by the proper <span class="SpellE">prosecutory</span> agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule of law mandates that an agency of
government be allowed to exercise only the powers granted it.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The pronouncements made above should not be
taken to mean that the <span class="SpellE">PCGG’s</span> creation of the AFP
Anti-Graft Board is a nullity and that the PCGG has no authority to investigate
and cause the prosecution of members and former members of the Armed Forces of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for violations of Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The PCGG may investigate and cause the prosecution of active and retired
members of the AFP for violations of Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379 only <b><u>in</u>
<u>relation</u> <u>to</u> <u>E.O.</u> <u>Nos.</u> <u>1,</u> <u>2,</u> <u>14</u>
<u>and</u> <u>14-A</u></b>, i.e., insofar as they involve the recovery of the
ill-gotten wealth of former Pres. Marcos and his family and “cronies.” But the
PCGG would not have jurisdiction over an ordinary case falling under Rep. Acts
Nos. 3019 and 1379, as in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>E.O. Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A did not envision the PCGG as the
investigator and prosecutor of all unlawful accumulations of wealth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG was created for a specific and
limited purpose, as we have explained earlier, and necessarily its powers must
be construed with this in mind.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">6. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his pleadings, private respondent contends
that he may no longer be prosecuted because of prescription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He relies on section 2 of Rep. Act No. 1379
which provides that “[t]he right to file such petition [for forfeiture of
unlawfully acquired wealth] shall prescribe within four years from the date of
resignation, dismissal or separation or expiration of the term of the officer
or employee concerned.” He retired on May 9, 1984, or more than six (6) years
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it must be pointed out
that section 2 of Rep. Act No. 1379 should be deemed amended or repealed by
Article XI, section 15 of the 1987 Constitution which provides that “[t]he
right of the State to recover properties unlawfully acquired by public
officials or employees, from them or from their nominees or transferees, shall
not be barred by prescription, <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, or <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.” Considering that sec. 2 of Rep. Act No. 1379 was
deemed amended or repealed before the prescriptive period provided therein had
lapsed insofar as private respondent is concerned, we cannot say that he had
already acquired a vested right that may not be prejudiced by <span style="">a </span>subsequent enactment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, to bar the Government from recovering ill-gotten wealth
would result in the validation or legitimization of the unlawful acquisition, a
consequence at variance with the clear intent of Rep. Act No. 1379, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 11.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Laws</u> <u>on</u> <u>prescription.</u></span> -
The laws concerning acquisitive prescription and limitation of actions cannot
be invoked by, nor shall they benefit the respondent, in respect to any
property unlawfully acquired by him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thus, </span>we hold that
the appropriate <span class="SpellE">prosecutory</span> agencies, i.e., the city
or provincial prosecutor and the Solicitor General under sec. 2 of Rep. Act No.
1379, may still investigate the case and file the petition for the forfeiture
of unlawfully acquired wealth against private respondent, now a private
citizen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(On the other hand, as regards
respondents for violations of Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379 who are still in the
government service, the agency granted the power to investigate and prosecute
them is the Office of the Ombudsman [Rep. Act No. 6770].) Under Presidential
Decree No. 1606, as <span class="GramE">amended,</span> and Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 195 violations of
Rep. Acts Nos. 3019 and 1379 shall be tried by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court hastens to add that this decision
is without prejudice to the prosecution of private respondent under the
pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code and other related penal laws.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of respondent judge dated June 26,
1989 in Civil Case No. 57092 is NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge is ORDERED to dismiss Civil
