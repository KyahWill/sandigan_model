<p class="BODY"><span>This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Manila in Civil Case No. 72498,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> entitled "<em>Philippine Refining Company 
v. Hon. Enrico Palomar</em>", finding that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> promotion schemes ("Breeze </span>Easy 
<span>Money" and "CAMIA Lucky-Key Hunt") were not in the nature of a lottery and 
enjoining appellant from issuing a "fraud order" on the afore-mentioned schemes 
of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It appears that the Philippine Refining Company, herein 
<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, resorted to two schemes to promote the sale 
of its products:<span>&nbsp; </span>Breeze Easy Money and CAMIA Lucky-Key Hunt, both 
of which envisioned the giving away for free of certain prizes (without 
additional consideration) for the purchase of Breeze soap and CAMIA cooking 
oil.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, the participants would get the exact value of 
the price for the goods plus the chance of winning in the scheme.<span> 
</span>No one would be re</span>quired to pay more than the usual price of the 
products.</p>
<p class="BODY">This Court has consistently ruled that a plan whereby prizes can 
be obtained without any additional consideration (when a product is purchased) 
is <em>not</em> a lottery (<span class="SpellE"><em>Uy</em></span><em> v. 
Palomar</em> L-23248, February 28, 1969; <em>U.S. v. Baguio</em>, <span>39 
</span>Phil. 862; <span class="SpellE"><em>Caltex</em></span><em> (Phil.) Inc. v. 
Postmaster-General</em>, 18 SCRA 247).<span>&nbsp; </span>It is thus clear that the 
schemes in the case at bar are not lotteries.</p>
<p class="BODY">The allegation that the prohibition by the Postmaster General 
should have first been appealed to the Department Secretary concerned in view of 
the doctrine denominated as "the exhaustion of administrative remedies" has no 
applicaÂ­tion here because one recognized exception to the doctrine is when the 
issue raised is purely a legal one.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>In view of the foregoing</b>, the Court RESOLVED to DISMISS 
this appeal and to AFFIRM the assailed decision of the Court of First 
Instance.</p>
