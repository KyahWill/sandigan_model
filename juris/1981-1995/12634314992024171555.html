				<BR><STRONG>REGALADO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This petition for review on 
<i>certiorari</i> seeks the nullification of
 the resolution of respondent Court of Appeals dated May 8, 1991, 
reconsidering its preceding resolution of March 15, 1991, in CA-G.R. SP 
No. 24120, entitled “Ma. Lourdes R. Villanueva vs. Blue Cross Insurance,
 Inc."
<p>
Petitioner's plaint in her present recourse narrates that on October 12,
 1989, she filed a complaint with the Insurance Commission alleging, 
inter alia, that, in consideration of the annual payment of P7,535.00, 
private respondent executed a policy of sickness and accident insurance;
 that on August 12, 1989, petitioner was admitted to a hospital where 
she was diagnosed and operated on for cholecystitis; that petitioner 
paid the hospital and doctor's bills in the aggregate sum of P48,934.05,
 the same being the actual hospital and professional fees charged to 
her; and that private respondent wrongfully refused to pay petitioner 
the said amount which she is entitled to recover under the policy.
</p><p>
Private respondent's answer raised the special and affirmative defenses 
that under the insurance policy, definitions and exclusions were clearly
 specified and among the exclusions are conditions which pre-existed 
before the effective date of the insurance of which the insured was 
aware or should reasonably be aware; and that cholecystitis was a 
pre-existing condition, hence petitioner’s sickness is non-compensable.
</p><p>
On September 21, 1990, the Insurance Commission rendered its decision in
 I.C. Case No. 3277 in favor of petitioner ordering private respondent 
to pay the latter the amount of P48,934.05 with legal interest from the 
date of the filing of the complaint until fully satisfied, plus 
P5,000.00 attorney's fees and costs. In the main, the Insurance 
Commission, after a review of them evidence presented, concluded that 
petitioner's illness, contrary to private respondent's defenses, was not
 a pre-existing disease and, therefore, is fully compensable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</p><p>
According to respondent court, a copy of said decision was received by 
private respondent on September 27, 1990. On October 15, 1990, or more 
than the fifteen (15) days allowed by Section 2, Republic Act No. 5434, 
private respondent filed a motion for reconsideration which petitioner 
opposed. On December 13, 1990, the Insurance Commission denied said 
motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  On December 17, 1990, private respondent filed a
 notice of appeal with the Insurance Commission.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
On March 15, 1991, the Third Division of respondent Court of Appeals 
dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was filed out of time and 
that private respondent did not duly file a copy of its notice of appeal
 with respondent Court as mandated by Republic Act No. 5434.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
Respondent court noted that under the aforesaid Section 2 of Republic 
Act No. 5434, private respondent had ten (10) days from its receipt on 
December 14, 1990 of the aforesaid order denying its motion for 
reconsi­deration within which to appeal. While respondent court, in its 
resolution of May 8, 1991, subsequently agreed that private respondent 
filed its notice of appeal with the Insurance Commission within the said
 10 day period, no such notice was filed with respondent court as 
required by Section 3, Republic Act No. 5434.
</p><p>
Private respondent then moved for the reconsideration of the dismissal 
of its appeal. On May 8, 1991, the Special Third Division of respondent 
court resolved to reconsider its original resolution and ordered the 
reinstatement of the appeal "in keeping with the ends of substantial 
justice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
</p><p>
Hence, the petition at bar with the following assignment of errors:
</p><ol><li>
The respondent court committed an error in reinstating the appeal when 
it has no jurisdiction to do so, no notice of appeal having been filed 
with it.
<p>
</p></li><li>
 The manner of appeal from quasi-judicial bodies has been fixed with the
 solemnity of a statute; the Court of Appeals erred in ignoring 
it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</li></ol>
We agree with petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred in 
reconsidering its previous resolution dismissing herein private 
respondent's appeal in CA-G.R. SP No. 24120. The dismissal of said 
appeal is proper and fully justified by private respondent's failure to 
file a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals as required by 
Republic Act No. 5434 for the perfection of its appeal from the decision
 of the Insurance Commission.
<p>
The Court of Appeals has been vested with exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or
 awards of quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or 
commissions, except those falling within the exclusive appellate 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. During the period relevant to and 
involved in the appeal from the Insurance Commission to respondent court
 in CA-G.R. SP No. 24120, subject of the present review, the appeal to 
the Court of Appeals from said quasi-judicial body was governed by the 
provisions of Republic Act No. 5434 insofar as the same are not 
inconsistent with the provisions of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
As restated and clarified in the Lacsamana case, to perfect an appeal 
under Republic Act No. 5434, the following rules must be observed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In an appeal from quasi-judicial bodies to the Court of 
Appeals 
under Republic Act No. 5434 and Section 22(c) of the Interim Rules, the 
appeal shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the Court of 
Appeals and with the quasi-judicial body within fifteen days from notice
 of the ruling, award, order, decision or judgment; or in case a motion 
for reconsideration is filed within said period, then within ten days 
from notice of the resolution denying the motion for reconsideration 
(Sections 2 and 3 of R.A. No. 5434). No extension of time to file such a
 notice of appeal is needed, much less allowed."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is, therefore, indubitable that to perfect an appeal, notice must be 
filed both with the Court of Appeals and with the board, commission or 
agency that made or rendered the ruling, award, order, decision or 
judgment appealed from. In the instant case, even assuming that a notice
 of appeal was seasonably filed with the Insurance Commission, no such 
notice of appeal was filed with the Court of Appeals. The said failure 
of petitioner to comply with the requirements of law for the perfection 
of its appeal is fatal to its present remedial attempt. It renders the 
decision of the Insurance Commission final and executory and the same 
can no longer be a subject of review.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
This Court has invariably ruled that perfection of an appeal in the 
manner and within the period laid down by law is not only mandatory but 
also jurisdictional.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  The 
failure to perfect an appeal as required by the rules has the effect of 
defeating the right of appeal of a party and precluding the appellate 
court from acquiring jurisdiction over the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
The right to appeal is not a natural right nor a part of due process; it
 is merely a statutory privilege, and may be exercised only in the 
manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  The party who seeks to avail of the same must comply with the 
requirements of the rules. Failing to do so, the right to appeal is 
lost.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
It is true that in some cases the filing of an appeal was allowed where a
 stringent application of the rules would have denied it, but only when 
it would serve the demands of substantial justice and in the exercise of
 the court’s equity jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  In the case at bar, however, the interests of justice would not be 
served by a policy of liberality, nor has the private respondent 
advanced any compelling reason to warrant the same. In fact, in its 
original resolution,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  
respondent court itself expounded at length on the very same doctrines 
enjoining strict compliance with the rules governing appeals which we 
have set out herein and, on such considerations, dismissed the appeal 
therein.
</p><p>
Moreover, relaxation of the rules is not called for since the issues 
raised are mainly factual. The decision of the Insurance Commission was 
based on its findings that the illness of private respondent, 
cholecystitis, was not a pre-existing ailment and is, therefore, fully 
compensable. It further specifically found that private respondent 
failed to prove petitioner's awareness of that pre-existing condition 
which is excluded under the insurance policy. We find no reason to 
disturb the said findings which are supported by the evidence on record 
and the conclusions of experts.
</p><p>
Settled is the that factual findings of administrative agencies are 
accorded not only respect but finality, because of the special knowledge
 and expertise gained by these quasi-judicial tribunals from handling 
specific matters falling under their jurisdiction.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  Courts cannot take cognizance of 
such factual issues.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup>
  In reviewing administrative decisions, the reviewing court cannot 
re-examine the sufficiency of the evidence. The findings of fact must be
 respected, so long as they are supported by substantial 
evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> 
</p><p>
It has long been recognized that strict compliance with the Rules of 
Court is indispensable for the prevention of needless delays and for the
 orderly and expeditious dispatch of judicial business.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  For a party to seek exception for its failure to comply strictly with 
the statutory requirements for perfecting its appeal, strong compelling 
reasons such as serving the ends of justice and preventing a grave 
miscarriage thereof must be shown, in order to warrant the Court's 
suspension of the rules.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>  Otherwise, the rules must strictly apply, as 
in this case.
