				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">For the death of Pacifico Peque on November 2, 1988 in the Municipality of Dulag, Province of Leyte, herein accused-appellant Edgardo Maceda, together with his two brothers-in-law, Antonio and Teodoro Vacal, were charged with murder in Criminal Case No. 89-02-87 of the Regional Trial Court of Leyte<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in an information dated February 21, 1989.&nbsp; However, only herein appellant was arraigned and tried on a plea of not guilty, since the Vacals were not apprehended and have since remained at large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>After trial, appellant was found guilty and sentenced to serve the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the widow of the deceased in the sum of P30,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>The antecedents which led to the filing of this criminal action are hereinunder set forth, as synthesized by the court <i>a quo</i> from the testimonies of the witnesses,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> and as clarified and amplified by us from the transcripts of the stenographic notes of the trial.<br><br>As testified by Inocencio Relador,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> he, together with Peque and a certain Myrna Bautista, were on their way home to Sitio Sinandigan from Barangay Cabacungan proper in the evening of November 2, 1988.&nbsp; About fifty (50) meters from the house of appellant, two (2) flashlights suddenly flashed their beams at them with the lights coming from the yard of appellant.<br><br>Appellant and his brothers-in-law, Antonio and Teodoro Vacal, then approached and met them at the front yard of the former's aforestated house, appellant and Antonio being armed with bolos and Teodoro with a local knife known as "pisao." Without warning, Teodoro stabbed Peque at the latter's back.&nbsp; Wounded, Peque fled in the direction of the barangay proper but he was pursued and overtaken by the appellant and his companions about one hundred (100) meters away from the point of initial confrontation.<br><br>Because of his confusion, Relador claimed that he also fled toward the same direction where Peque and his armed pursuers were headed but he tripped and sprawled on a grassy spot about fifteen (15) meters from where Peque was overtaken by appellant and the latter's companions.&nbsp; From there, he saw how Maceda and the Vacals took turns in stabbing and hacking Peque.<br><br>Appellant understandably submits a different version of the macabre incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> He admits having killed Peque but pleads self-defense and exculpates his brothers-in-law from any participation in the killing.&nbsp; According to appellant, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening of November 2, 1988, he and his family were eating supper when Peque arrived at their backyard and challenged him to come out and fight.&nbsp; Peque then pushed their kitchen door aside where he was met by appellant's mother-in-law, Rosario Vacal, whom Peque stabbed and wounded on the dorsal portion of her left palm.<br><br>Believing that Peque had fled, and fearing that he may return and create further trouble, appellant told his family that they would transfer to his father's house at Barangay Del Carmen.&nbsp; Appellant then carried his 3-year old son and all of them, each carrying one of his children, were about to pass the gate when Peque, who had hidden himself behind a coconut tree, met him with a thrust of a "pisao" about eight inches long.<br><br>Allegedly wounded superficially in the inner portion of his right forearm, appellant put down his son, unsheathed his bolo, faced Peque and delivered several stabbing and hacking blows to his body without letup.&nbsp; Peque then struggled and fled from the yard to a distance of about fifteen (15) meters where he fell and bled to death.<br><br>In his brief, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding him guilty of the crime of murder and sentencing him to serve the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the widow in the sum of P30,000.00; and in not acquitting him, instead, of the offense charged.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Appellant's pretensions do not inspire credence.&nbsp; Firmly entrenched is the rule that where the accused invokes self-defense, it is incumbent upon him to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he indeed acted in defense of himself.&nbsp; He must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that of the prosecution.&nbsp; For, even if the prosecution evidence is weak, it could not be disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the killing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>In the present case, the burden of evidence having been shifted, we find the narrations of the sequence of events by the accused and the witness for the defense, Rosario Vacal, decidedly unconvincing, not only because of their inherent conflict with each other but also on account of their inconsistency with the common experience and observation of mankind.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>To support appellant's contention that he acted in self-defense, his mother-in-law, Rosario Vacal, testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%">Q </td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Now you said that Pacifico Pique<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and Edgardo Maceda fought in the yard of the house of Edgardo Maceda, did I get you correct?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>A</td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.

</tbody></table></blockquote>We cannot but find the aforequoted testimony as an affront to credulity.&nbsp; Even indulging the witness in the scenario she has presented on the supposed fight between

fate that could have befallen appellant in his encounter with the deceased.&nbsp; If they could not run to the aid of appellant for fear of the consequences, the least they could have done was to seek the aid of other persons or the proper authorities to avert any further untoward occurrences.&nbsp; They, however, allegedly did not do so.&nbsp; Worse, they let the evening pass just like any other day as if nothing serious had happened, they all just went to sleep.&nbsp; This is an incredible and unnatural reaction of the wife, the mother-in-law and the brothers-in-law of Maceda who, to all

</tbody></table></blockquote>In any event, self-defense on the part of appellant is further negated by the physical evidence in the case.&nbsp; Specifically, the number of wounds, twelve (12) in all, indicates that Maceda's act was no longer an act of self-defense but a determined effort to kill his victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> As perceptively observed by the trial court, appellant admitted that his first bolo hack across the face of the victim was a mortal wound sufficient to stop further attack and eliminate any peril to appellant.&nbsp; Further we agree that appellant's claim that he acted alone and his theory of self-defense are refuted by the twelve (12) wounds of the victim, especially in the light of the uncontradicted testimony of witness Inocencio Relador.<br><br>Considering, moreover, the location and the serious nature of the wounds suffered by the deceased, it is incredible that he was still able to run the distance of fifteen (15) meters as appellant would make it appear.&nbsp; Indeed, the trial court's suggestion that the deceased ran after he was first stabbed, before the appellant could deal him the fatal blows, stands more to reason and all the more negates self-defense.&nbsp; For, by then, even the supposed unlawful aggression would have ceased; and when unlawful aggression which has begun no longer exists, the one making the defense has no more right to kill or even wound the former aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>Noteworthy is the fact that the corpse of the victim was found about one hundred (100) meters distant from his house and not within the immediate vicinity of appellant's house.&nbsp; Accordingly, the prosecution's version that the deceased was first stabbed in front of his house, after which he ran for his life but was overtaken and hacked by appellant and his companions some one hundred (100) meters away, appears to be more consistent with the truth of what actually transpired in this case.<br><br>Parenthetically, whether or not appellant acted in self-defense is essentially a question of fact.&nbsp; Being so and in the absence of any showing that the court <i>a quo</i> failed to appreciate facts or circumstances of weight and substance that would have altered its conclusion, the court below, having seen and heard the witnesses during the trial, is in a better position to evaluate their testimonies.&nbsp; No compelling reason, therefore, exists for this Court to disturb the trial court's finding that appellant did not act in self-defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>It bears mention, at this point, that the trial court properly convicted appellant of murder.&nbsp; Although it made no disquisition in its decision of the circumstances which qualified the killing to murder, a perusal of the facts of the case will readily reveal that treachery and abuse of superior strength attended the killing.<br><br>While the aforementioned circumstances may not simply be deduced from presumption as it is necessary that the existence of these aggravating or qualifying circumstances be duly proven as the crime itself,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> the rule does not preclude proof of their attendance by circumstantial evidence.&nbsp; By either means of proof, however, said circumstances are amply demonstrable in the case before us.<br><br>Here, immediately prior to the stabbing, appellant and his companions flashed the beams of their flashlights on the face of the victim, momentarily blinding the latter, hence the sudden criminal attack, although frontal, was treacherously perpetrated in a manner tending to directly insure its execution and with impunity to the assailants.<br><br>In the same breath, when all of the said malefactors, wielding bolos and a knife, simultaneously attacked the victim who was unarmed and trying to flee, abuse of superior strength cannot be more manifest.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> However, such circumstance can no longer be taken into account to aggravate the liability of appellant since the same is already absorbed in treachery,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> not to speak of the fact that, under the circumstances of this case and the present state of the law, the penalty imposed on appellant can not be further increased.&nbsp; The same is true with respect to the alleged circumstance of evident premeditation, aside from our persuasion that the evidence does not support a finding of its attendance.<br><br>Finally, on the items constituting the civil liability of accused-appellant, the Court hereby awards in favor of the widow of the decease the sum of P7,000.00 in actual damages, representing funeral and burial expenses which are duly evidenced by receipts and promissory notes corresponding to the loans contracted by her to defray said expenses.&nbsp; The death indemnity is also further increased to P50,000.00 in accordance with the policy adopted by the Court en banc on August 30, 1990.<br><br>WHEREFORE, subject to the aforestated modifi­cations, the judgment of the trial court is hereby AFFIRMED.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Melencio-Herrera, (Chairman), Paras, Padilla,</i> and <i>Sarmiento, JJ.</i>, concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="NOSHADE" size="1"
