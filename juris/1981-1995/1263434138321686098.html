				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for the review of the decision of the then
Intermediate Appellate Court (IAC), dated April 8, 1986 in AC-G.R. No.
SP-06313, entitled "BF Homes, Inc. v. Judge Ansberto P. Paredes, etc., et
al.," annulling the decision of the trial court and directing the Register
of Deeds to suspend issuance of the owners' copies of the land titles to the
Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation ("RCBC"), purchaser of the
foreclosed properties of private respondent BF <span style="">Homes, Inc. ("BF Homes") until the matter shall have been
resolved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in SEC Case No. 002693
and its Resolution on May 28, 1986 denying RCBC's motion for reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case are
narrated in the Court of Appeals' decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 28, 1984, B.F. Homes filed a "Petition for
Rehabilitation and for Declaration or Suspension of Payments" (SEC Case
No. 002693) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the creditors listed in its inventory of creditors and
liabilities was RCBC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 26, 1984, RCBC requested the Provincial Sheriff of
Rizal to extra-judicially foreclose its real estate mortgage on some properties
of B.F. Homes.  A notice of
extra-judicial foreclosure sale was issued by the Sheriff on October 29, 1984, scheduled
on November 29, 1984, copies furnished both B.F. Homes (mortgagor) and RCBC
(mortgagee).</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of B.F. Homes, the SEC issued on November 28, 1984 in
SEC Case No. 002693 a temporary restraining order (TRO), effective for 20 days,
enjoining RCBC and the sheriff from proceeding with the public auction
sale.  The sale was rescheduled to
January 29, 1985.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 25, 1985, the SEC ordered the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction upon petitioner's filing of a bond.  However, petitioner did not file a bond
until January 29, 1985, the very day of the auction sale, so no writ of
preliminary injunction was issued by the SEC.  Presumably, unaware of the filing of the bond, the sheriffs proceeded
with the public auction sale on January 29, 1985, in which RCBC was the highest
bidder for the properties auctioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 5, 1985, B.F. Homes filed in the SEC a consolidated
motion to annul the auction sale and to cite RCBC and the sheriff for
contempt.  RCBC opposed the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Because of t<span style="">he </span>proceedings in the SEC, the sheriff
withheld the delivery to RCBC of a certificate of sale covering the auctioned
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February <span style="">13, </span>1985,
the <span style="">SEC </span>in <span style="">Case </span>No. 002693 belatedly issued a
writ of preliminary injunction stopping the <span style="">auction sale </span>which had been conducted by the sheriff two weeks
earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 13, 1985, despite SEC Case No. 002693, RCBC filed with
the Regional Trial Court, Br. 140, Rizal (CC 10042) an action for <i>mandamus</i>
against the provincial sheriff of Rizal and his deputy to compel them to
execute in its favor a certificate of sale of the auctioned properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer, the sheriffs alleged that they proceeded with the
auction sale on January 29, 1985 because no writ of preliminary injunction had
been issued by SEC as of that date, but they informed the SEC that they would
suspend the issuance of a certificate of sale to RCBC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 18, 1985, the SEC appointed a Management Committee for
B.F. Homes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On RCBC's motion in the <i>mandamus</i> case, the trial court
issued on May 8, 1985 a judgment on the pleadings, the dispositive portion of
which states:<sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></sup></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, petitioner's ‘Motion for Judgment on the
pleadings’ is granted and judgment is hereby rendered ordering respondents to
execute and deliver to petitioner the Certificate of the Auction Sale of
January 29, 1985, involving the properties sold therein, more particularly
those described in Annex 'C' of their Answer." (p. 87, <span style="">Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 4, 1985, B.F. Homes filed an original complaint with the
IAC pursuant to Sec. 9 of B.P. 129 praying for annulment of the judgment,
premised on the following:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x:  (1) even
before RCBC asked the sheriff to extrajudicially foreclose its mortgage on
petitioner's properties, the SEC had already assumed exclusive jurisdiction
over those assets, and (2) that there was extrinsic fraud in procuring the
judgment because the petitioner was not impleaded as a party in the <i>mandamus</i>
case, respondent court did not acquire jurisdiction over it, and it was
deprived of its right to be heard." (CA Decision, p. 88, Rollo)<sup><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 8, 1986, the IAC rendered a decision, setting aside the
decision of the trial court, dismissing the <i>mandamus</i> case and suspending
issuance to <span style="">RCBC </span>of new land
titles, "until the resolution of case by SEC in Case No. 002693,"
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment dated May 8, 1985 in Civil Case No.
10042 is hereby annulled and set aside <span style="">and
</span>the case is hereby dismissed.  In
view of the admission of respondent Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation that
the sheriffs' certificate of sale has been registered on B.F. Homes’ TCT's Nos.

48151, 48165 (sic), 48128, 48194, 68603, 71273, 71275, and 71276, the Register
of Deeds for Pasay City is hereby ordered to <u>suspend</u> the issuance to the
mortgagee- purchaser, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, of the owner's
copies of the new land titles replacing them <u>until</u> <u>the</u> <u>matter</u>
<u>shall</u> <u>have</u> <u>been</u> <u>resolved</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Securities</u>
<u>and</u> <u>Exchange</u> <u>Commission</u> <u>in</u> <u>SEC</u> <u>Case</u> <u>No.</u>
<u>002693</u>." (p. 91, Rollo) (emphasis ours).<sup><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></sup></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 18, 1986, RCBC filed its present petition on the
following assigned errors:</p>

<blockquote>1.  Petitioner did not commit extrinsic fraud in
excluding private respondent as party defendant in Special Civil Case No. 10042
as private respondent was not indispensable party thereto, its participation
not being necessary for the full resolution of the issues raised in said case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  S<span style="">EC.
Case No. 2693 cannot be invoked to suspend Special Civil Case No. 10042, and
for that matter, the </span>extrajudicial foreclosure of the real estate
mortgage in petitioner's favor, as these do not constitute actions against
private respondent contemplated under section 6(c) of Presidential Decree No.
902-A.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Even assuming <u>arguendo</u> that the extra-judicial
sale constitutes an action that may be suspended under section 6(c) of
Presidential Decree No. 902-A, the basis for the suspension thereof did not
exist so <span style="">as</span> to adversely affect
the <span style="">validity and regularity thereof.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  The Regional Trial Court had jurisdiction to
take cognizance of Special Civil Case No. 10042.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  The Regional Trial Court had jurisdiction
over Special Civil Case <span style="">No.
10042." (p. 5, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1986, <span style="">We </span>gave
due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24, 1986, RCBC filed <span style="">a </span>"Manifestation" informing Us that on October 16,
1986, the SEC in Case No. 002693 had issued an Order denying the consolidated
Motion to Annul the Auction Sale and to cite RCBC and the sheriff for contempt,
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petitioner's ‘Consolidated Motion to Cite
Sheriff and Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation for Contempt and to Annul
Proceedings and Sale’, dated February 5, 1985, should be, as it is, hereby
DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>While</u> </span><u>we</u>
<u><span style="">cannot</span></u><span style=""> <u>direct</u> </span>the Register of Deeds <u>to</u>
<u><span style="">allow</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u><span style="">consolidation</span></u><span style=""> </span>of
the titles subject of the 'Omnibus Motion' dated September 18, 1986 filed by
the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation, and therefore, denied said Motion, <u><span style="">neither</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>can</u> <u>this</u> <u><span style="">Commission</span></u><span style=""> <u>restrain</u> </span>the said bank and the
Register of Deeds from effecting said consolidation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 138, Rollo, emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">as a consequence of which, "the
Register of Deeds of Pasay City effected the transfer of title over the subject
properties to petitioner and caused the issuance of new titles in its name,"
and therefore "the interest of petitioner to continue prosecuting the
instant petition has become moot and the issues raised therein have become
academic." Petitioner RCBC further prayed that <span style="">"x x x </span>the (instant) petition be deemed as mooted by the
events that transpired, <span style="">x x x<b> </b></span>and
that "this petition be thereby dismissed."</p>

<p class="BODY">  We note the precipitate
manner in which the transfers of title in RCBC's name had been effected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved by the appellate court's decision, RCBC had invoked
this Court's jurisdiction.  We gave due
course to its petition on November 27, 1986.  It now manifests its loss <span style="">of </span>interest
to pursue the case because it had "effectively achieved" what had
been nullified by the appellate court, without awaiting Our final ruling on its
<span style="">petition.<b><o:p></o:p></b></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Based on its
manifestation, it would seem that the Pasay City Register of Deeds had taken
the SEC Resolution dated October 16, 1986 as its cue for proceeding with the
transfers of title, despite an explicit directive in the Court of Appeals'
decision "to suspend issuance x x x until the matter shall have been
resolved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in SEC Case No.
002693."</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">SEC </span>Case No. 002693
is BF Homes' rehabilitation.  On the
other hand, <span style="">SEC </span>Resolution dated <span style="">October 16, </span>1986 is a denial of BF
Homes' Consolidated Motion to Annul the auction sale and to cite RCBC and
sheriff for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">By specifically mentioning the case number (002693) the appellate
court could only have meant the BF Homes' rehabilitation and not any
indiscriminate action taken by the SEC.  Hence, until final rehabilitation, both RCBC and the Pasay City Register
of Deeds had to abide by the explicit directive of the appellate court to <u>suspend</u>,
in the meantime, issuance <span style="">of new land
titles, </span>or effect <span style="">registration
in </span>RCBC's name.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against this background, We do not see any merit in considering
the case closed or terminated, for being moot and academic, since there is
basis for nullifying end setting aside the TCTs in RCBC's name.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now discuss the merits of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court had ruled on the illegality of the <i>mandamus</i>
case and thus set aside the decision of the lower court, directing the delivery
of the certificates of auction sale.  This ruling effectively upholds the exclusive jurisdiction of the SEC
(under Sec. 5(d) of PD 902-A as amended) over the assets and properties of a
distressed firm under PD 902-A, as amended.  In the cases of BF Homes, Inc. v. CA, et al., G.R. No. 76879 and Roa v.
CA, G.R. No. 77143, October 3, 1990, We clarified that when a corporation threatened
by bankruptcy is taken over by a receiver, all the creditors should stand on an
equal footing, not anyone should be given preference by paying one or some of
them ahead of the others.</p>

<p class="BODY">RCBC and the Pasay City Register of Deeds must have premised their
action on SEC's refusal in the resolution dated October 16, 1986 to exercise
jurisdiction on the contempt case, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While we cannot direct the Register of Deeds to allow the
consolidation of the titles subject of the 'Omnibus Motion' dated September 18,
1986 filed by the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation and, therefore, denies
said Motion, neither can this Commission restrain the said bank and the
Register of Deeds from effecting said consolidation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">as their go-signal to disregard the
appellate court's directive and proceed with the registration of titles.  Their action of course, is clearly
contumacious and both are equally guilty of contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the properties, subject of the motion for contempt (in the
SEC) involved assets of a distressed firm, SEC would have been fully justified
in issuing the corresponding restraining order against the consolidation of
title in RCBC, pursuant to Sec. 6(a), PD 902-A, as amended.  However, We do not know if the SEC
Resolution dated October 16, 1986 was ever questioned by BF Homes.  At any rate, since this was not raised as an
issue here, We shall refrain from discussing this.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact remains that by ordering the suspension of registration
of titles, the appellate court clearly intended to have BF Homes'
assets/properties <u>remain untouched</u> during the period of rehabilitation
so as not to render the SEC Management Committee irrelevant and inutile and to
give it unhampered "rescue efforts" over the distressed firm.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also agree with BF Homes that as owner, it should have been
impleaded in CC 10042 to allow it to protect its rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, since RCBC had gone ahead with the registration of
title in complete defiance of the Court of Appeals' directive, We have no
recourse except <span style="">to set aside such
transfer and nullify the TCTs issued in RCBC's name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is recognized that RCBC is a preferred creditor and
likewise the highest bidder at the auction sale, We have however stated that
whenever a distressed corporation asks the SEC for rehabilitation and
suspension of payments, preferred creditors may no longer assert such
preference, but as earlier stated, stand on equal footing with other
creditors.  Foreclosure shall be
disallowed so as not to prejudice other creditors, or cause discrimination
among them.  If foreclosure is
undertaken despite the fact that a petition for rehabilitation has been filed,
the certificate of sale shall not be delivered pending <span style="">rehabilitation.  Likewise, if
this has also been done, no transfer of title shall be effected also, within
the period of rehabilitation.  The
rationale behind PD 902-­A, </span>as <span style="">amended,
is to effect </span>a <u><span style="">feasible</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
</span><u><span style="">viable</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">rehabilitation.  This cannot be achieved if one creditor is
preferred over the others.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the prohibition against foreclosure <u>attaches</u>
<u>as</u> <u>soon</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>petition</u> <u>for</u> <u>rehabilitation</u>
<u>is</u> <u>filed</u>.  Were it
otherwise, what is to prevent the petitioner from delaying the creation of the
Management Committee and in the meantime dissipate all its assets.  The sooner the SEC takes over and imposes a
freeze on all the assets, the better for all concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DISMISSED, the decision of
the Court of Appeals is AFFIRMED with the modification that RCBC and Vicente A.
Garcia, Pasay City Register of Deeds, are hereby found guilty of CONTEMPT and
FINED One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) each.  The new torrens titles issued in RCBC's name are hereby NULLIFIED and
SET ASIDE and BF Homes TCT's Nos. 51001, 51002, 51003, 51005, 51006, 51007,

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FELICIANO, <i>J.</i>:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the statement of facts set out in the <u>ponencia</u> of my
learned brother in the Court, Mr. Justice Medialdea, the following items are
found, among other things:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“On September 28, 1984, B.F. Homes filed a ‘Petition for Rehabilitation
and for declaration of suspension of payments’ (SEC Case No. 002693) with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="text-align: center;" align="center"><span style="">x </span>x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span style="">x </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span style="">x x<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>On March 18, 1985, the SEC appointed a management committee for
B.F. Homes.” <span style="">(<u>Ponencia</u> </span>pages
2-3)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, a period of just about six (6) months intervened
between the filing of the petition for rehabilitation and for declaration of
suspension of payments and the appointment by the SEC of a management committee
for B.F. Homes.  During that intervening
six (6) months period, the SEC purported to act by issuing, on 28 November
1984, a temporary restraining order enjoining the Rizal Commercial Banking
Corporation (RCBC) and the Sheriff from proceeding with the extra-judicial
foreclosure sale.  On 13 February 1985,
the SEC belatedly issued a writ of preliminary injunction purportedly stopping
the auction sale actually conducted by the Sheriff two (2) weeks earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>ponencia</u> also states:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“While it is recognized that
RCBC is a preferred creditor and likewise the highest bidder at the auction
sale, We have, however, stated that whenever a distressed corporation asks the
SEC for rehabilitation and suspension of payments, preferred creditor may no
longer assert such preference, but as earlier stated stand an equal footing
with other creditors.  Foreclosure shall
be disallowed so as not to prejudice other creditors, or cause discrimination
among them.</span></blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="text-align: center;" align="center">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<blockquote>In this connection, the prohibition against foreclosure <u>attaches
as soon as a petition for rehabilitation is filed</u>.  Were it otherwise, what is to prevent the
petitioner from delaying the creation of the management committee and in the
meantime dissipate all its assets.  The
sooner the SEC takes and imposes a freeze on all the assets, the better for all
concerned.” (Emphasis partly in the original and partly supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">I understand the above quoted portion of
the <u>ponencia</u> to be saying that <u>suspension of actions</u> for claims
against the corporation which applies for rehabilitation <u>takes effect as
soon as the application or a petition for rehabilitation is filed with the SEC</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would point out, with respect, that the actual language used in
Section 6 (c) and (d) of P.D. No. 902-A, as amended, does <u>not</u> support
the position taken in the <u>ponencia</u>.  The pertinent provision of Section 6 (c) is as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">“Sec. </span>6.  In order to effectively exercise such
jurisdiction, the Commission shall possess the following powers:</blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="text-align: center;" align="center">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>c) To appoint one or
more receivers of the property, real and personal, which is the subject of the
action pending before the Commission in accordance with the pertinent
provisions of the Rules of Court in such other cases whenever necessary to
preserve the rights of the parties-litigants to and/or protect the interest of
the investing public and creditors; Provided, however, That the <u>Commission
may</u>, <u>in appropriate cases</u>, <u>appoint a rehabilitation receiver</u>
of corporations, partnerships or other associations not supervised or regulated
by other government agencies who shall have, in addition to the powers of a
regular receiver under the provisions of the Rules of Court, such functions and
powers as are provided for in the succeeding paragraph (d) hereof; Provided,
further, that the Commission may appoint a rehabilitation receiver of corporations,
partnership or other associations supervised or regulated by other government
agencies, such as banks and insurance companies, upon request of the government
agency concerned; Provided, finally, that <u>upon appointment of a management
committee, rehabilitation receiver, board or body</u> pursuant to this Decree, <u>all
actions for claims against corporations</u>, partnerships or associations <u>under
management or receivership</u> pending before any court, tribunal, board or
body shall be <u>suspended</u> accordingly.</blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: center;" align="center">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

<blockquote>(Emphases supplied)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be pointed out that the appointment of a management
committee or a rehabilitation receiver is not ordinarily effected immediately
upon the filing of an application for suspension of payments and for rehabilita­tion.  The reason is that the SEC must first
determine whether the jurisdictional requirements for the appointment of a
management committee are present.  There
are at least two (2) sets of requirements:  a) the requirements in respect of the petition for declaration of
suspension of payments; and b) the requirements concerning the petition for
creation and appointment of a management committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirements which must be satisfied in respect of <span style="">a</span> declaration of suspension of
payments are set out in Section 5 (d) P.D. No. 902-A, as amended by P.D. No.
1758, which reads <span style="">as </span>follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SEC. 5.  In addition to the
regulatory and adjudication functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission
over corporations, partnerships and other forms of associations registered with
it as expressly granted under existing laws and decrees, it shall have original
and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:</blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="text-align: center;" align="center">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</p>

<blockquote>d) Petitions of
corporations, partnership or associations to be declared in the state of <u>suspension
of payments in cases where the corporation</u>, partnership or association <u>possesses
sufficient property to cover all its debts but foresees the impossibility of
meeting them when they respectively fall due</u> or <u>in cases where the
corporation</u>, partnership or association <u>has no sufficient assets</u> to
cover its liabilities, <u>but is under the management of a</u> Rehabilitation
Receiver or <u>Management Committee</u> created pursuant to this Decree.”
(Underscoring and emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon the other hand, the requirements
which must be shown if a management committee is to be appointed by the SEC are
set out in Section 6 (d) of the same statute:</p>

<blockquote>d) <u>To create and
appoint a management committee, board, or body</u> upon petition or <u>motu</u>
<u>proprio</u> to undertake the management <span style="">of </span>corporations, partnerships or other associations not
supervised or regulated by other government agencies in appropriate cases <u>when
there is imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or destruction of assets</u>
or other properties or <u>paralization of business operations</u> of such
corporations or entities <u>which may be prejudicial to the interest of
minority stockholders, parties-litigants or the general public</u>; Provided,
further, that the Commission may create or appoint a management committee, board
or body to undertake the management of corporations, partnerships or other
associations supervised or regulated by other government agencies, such as
banks and insurance companies, upon request of the government agency concerned.</blockquote>

<p class="XXX" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: center;" align="center">x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x x x”</p>

<blockquote>(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Moreover, the SEC could conclude that the
condition of the petitioning corporation is such that appointment of a
management committee would <u>not</u> be appropriate, that the condition of
insolvency (“no sufficient assets to cover its liabilities”) is realistically
irreversible, or that its restructuring and rehabilitation would not be
feasible.  Section 6(d), second
paragraph reads:</p>

<blockquote>“The management committee or rehabilitation receiver, board or body
shall have the power to take custody of, and control over, all the existing
assets and property of such entities under management; to evaluate the existing
assets and liabilities, earnings and operations of such corporations,
partnership or other associations, to determine the best way to salvage and
protect the interest of the investors and creditors; to study, review and
evaluate the feasibility of continuing operations and restructure and
rehabilitate such entities <u>if determined to be feasible by the Commission</u>.  It shall report and <span style="">be </span>responsible to the Commission until dissolved by order of the
Commission:  x x x.” (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As already noted, SEC took just about six (6) months after the
filing of the petition of B.F. Homes to decide to create and appoint a
management committee.  <u>Only upon such
appointment of the management committee did the proviso in Section 6 (c) which
decrees suspension of actions</u> for claims against the petitioning
corporation <u>take effect</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It is only then that the SEC determines that the circumstances
warranting, under the statute, the appointment of a management committee do
exist, i.e., that there is “imminent danger of dissipation, loss, wastage or
destruction of assets --- or paralization of business operations --- which
[would] be prejudicial to the interest of minority stockholders, parties
litigant or the general public.” Only when such circumstances have been
determined to exist is there justification for suspending actions for claims
against the corporation so placed under SEC management.  The authority of the SEC to suspend or
freeze the judicial enforcement of claims against a corporation is an <u>extraordinary</u>
authority, most specially where credits secured by specific liens on property,
like real estate mortgages, are involved; such authority cannot lightly be
assumed to have arisen simply because the corporation <u>on its own initiative</u>
goes to the SEC and there seeks shelter from its lawful creditors.  Lastly, but not least, it should be recalled
that creditors secured by specific liens on property are, under our insolvency
law, entitled to opt to rely solely upon their security and hence to refrain
from joining other (unsecured) creditors who must share among themselves the
remaining assets of the insolvent corporation once voluntary or involuntary
insolvency proceedings are commenced.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that in <u>In re Petition for Declaration of
Insolvency of [a] Filand Manufacturing and Estate Development Company; et al</u>.
(G.R. No. 73123, dated 2 September 1991), the Court stressed that the SEC like
any <span style="">other administrative body is a
tribunal with limited jurisdiction and as such may wield only such powers as
are specifically granted to it by its enabling statute and that its
jurisdiction should be interpreted in </span><u><span style="">strictissimi juris</span></u><span style="">.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, respectfully suggest that the SEC acted prematurely
and without jurisdiction or legal authority when, on 28 November 1984, it
issued a temporary restraining order enjoining RCBC and the Sheriff from
proceeding with the public auction sale, and when, on 13 February 1985, the SEC
issued a writ of preliminary injunction stopping the auction sale which,
incidentally, had already been conducted two (2) weeks earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to grant the Petition for Review and to reverse and set
aside the Decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
