				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A picture speaks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>thousand
words, it has been said.  The
prosecution presented a Polaroid picture of accused-appellant Daniel C. Navarro
with his sexual organ halfway inside his daughter’s private part.  His daughter, then eleven years old,
testified that it was painful when her father inserted his organ inside her
private part.  His wife, who took the
picture with a Polaroid camera given by one Robert Tanner,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that she took the picture when her husband’s sexual organ had already
penetrated her daughter’s private part and was on the verge of completely being
inserted, as this was the instruction of said Robert Tanner.  Accused-appellant waived his right to present
evidence on his behalf even if his Demurrer to Evidence would be denied.  He now appeals his conviction for rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Daniel C. Navarro was charged with the crime of
rape alleged to have been committed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“That in or about September 1989, in the City of Zamboanga, Philippines,
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">carnal knowledge of x </span>x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ANGELITA </span>NAVARRO y <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">CRUZ, his daughter, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court, the antecedents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>this case are, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Angelita Navarro is a pretty Grade IV pupil at Immaculate
Concepcion Elementary School at Tetuan, Zamboanga City.  She is called An-An by her parents and by
the kids <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in their neighborhood.  She testified that she is eleven years
old.  She was born on April 28,
1978.  This fact was indubitably
established by her Certificate of Birth marked as Exhibit “F”.  She resided with her parents, Daniel and
Elizabeth Navarro, and her brothers Dennis, 17 yrs. old, and Robert, 4 years
old, at their house at Gov. Alvarez St., Camino Nuevo, Zamboanga City.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“When she was five (5) years old, her father, accused Daniel
Navarro, took her to Lantaka Hotel where he was then working as waiter and
introduced her to an American named Robert Tanner who used to come to Zamboanga
City every year.  When she was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">eight (8) years old, her father again took
her to Tanner’s room at Lantaka Hotel.  Her father had conversation with Tanner and then left her inside
Tanner’s room.  When she was alone with
Tanner in the room, the latter took her pictures while she was naked.  Then Tanner asked her to pose with her legs
apart and took her pictures while she was in that position.  </span>x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">x.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Angelita calls Tanner ‘Papa Bob’.  Tanner calls her ‘Bobbi’.  Tanner
calls Daniel Navarro ‘Boone’, ‘Osi-san’, ‘old Dan’, and Elizabeth Navarro
‘Beth’, and ‘Beautiful Girl’ (tsn, p. 34, id).  Tanner gave Angelita a wrist watch, magazines and toys.  He gave to her father two Polaroid cameras
which she identified in court (Exh. ‘I’; ‘J’).  A picture taken with a Polaroid camera develops in itself in a few
seconds (tsn, pp. 60-61, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">id).  With a Polaroid camera, ‘pictures are taken,
developed and printed in less than a minute’ (Merit Students Encyclopedia, Vol.
4, </span>p. 69).  Angelita’s father and
mother used <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the Polaroid cameras to
take her nude pictures which were sent to Tanner in the United States.  In return, Tanner sent dollars to her
father.  Tanner was the one paying for
the tuition fees of Angelita and for her school uniforms and other needs since </span>1985.  Angelita said:  ‘It is just like paying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">me
because he used to have pictures coming from me’ (tsn, p. 67, id).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“From 1985 to 1988, many pictures were sent by her parents to
Tanner.  In all the pictures, she was
naked.  Tanner does not like pictures
with her clothes on.  In some pictures,
she was lying down with her legs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">spread
apart and her vagina exposed.  On one
occasion twenty (20) pictures were taken.  Sixteen (16) were sent to Tanner and the four were left behind.  The pictures were taken by her father or by
her mother on orders of her father (tsn, pp. 55-57, 76, 81, id).  When Tanner’s money arrive, her parents play
mah­jong.  Angelita joins her mother in
playing mahjong using Tanner’s money (tsn, p. 79, id).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sometime in the month of September or October, 1989, while
Angelita was inside a room in their house at Governor Alvarez, her father asked
her to undress in the presence of her mother who was also in the room.  It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was
about 4:30 in the afternoon.  Angelita
just came from school.  When she was
already naked, her father ordered her mother to take several pictures with the
use of a Polaroid camera.  One picture
shows Angelita standing, completely naked, wearing a hat, with her private parts
exposed (Exh. ‘A’).  Another picture
shows Angelita with her open mouth and tongue a few centimeters below her
father’s bared penis (Exh. ‘C’).  A
picture was taken while she was actually sucking inside her mouth her father’s
penis; another with her legs spread apart.  On this occasion, her father inserted his penis inside her vagina while
her mother took pictures of the sexual connection (Exh. ‘B’).  All the pictures, including one with her
father’s penis lodged inside her vagina, except the three (3) pictures marked
as Exhibits ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’, were sent to Robert Tanner in the United States
(tsn, pp. 10-11, 15-20, 23, 76-77, April 16, 1990).  Angelita testified that it was painful when her father pushed his
erected penis into her sexual organ because his penis was able to penetrate
inside her vagina.  She said:  ‘x x x My father just inserted his
penis.  When I felt the pain, I told my
father that it is painful.  According to
my father, never mind’ (tsn, p. 76, id).  </span>x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

convicting him of the crime of rape as his penis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>not erect during the supposed intercourse, thereby negating
any assertion by the prosecution that his penis had been inserted inside his
daughter’s vagina.  He claims that it is
impossible to insert and lodge a soft, flaccid and limp penis between the lips
of his daughter’s private part; as his penis was just “attached” to the labia.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant’s arguments are fallacious in the face of the
damaging evidence of the Prosecution showing how he raped his daughter, to
wit:  the testimonies of both the victim
and accused-appellant’s wife narrating how the accused-appellant had sexual
intercourse with Angelita, the medical report on the condition of the victim’s
private part after the rape showing lacerations on the victim’s hymen and the
actual picture of the rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> At
any rate, there is consummated rape where the penis of the accused touched the
middle part of the vagina, having penetrated the labia of the pudendum; full
penetration or rupture of the hymen is not essential.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant’s pretension of innocence is utterly devoid
of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">To understand, why such a heinous and shocking incident could
have happened, this Court quotes, with approval, the following finding of fact
by the trial court, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The uncontradicted evidence of the prosecution established that
accused Daniel Navarro facilitated or promoted the corruption of his
eleven-year old daughter by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">leaving her
to sleep alone in the hotel room of Robert Tanner; allowing her to go with
Tanner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Manila where she slept in the same bed in a
hotel with Tanner; taking nude pictures of his daughter in different obscene
poses and forcing his wife to do so; inserting his penis inside his daughter’s
vagina and asking his wife to take pictures of the sexual act; sending the
obscene pictures of his minor daughter to Tanner in the United States to
satisfy the lust of Tanner, </span><b><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">all</span></i></b><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> </span><b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dollars</b>

corroborated the fact of rape with her testimony that Angelita’s hymen had a
healed incomplete laceration at 3 o’clock and healed complete lacerations at 6
o’clock and 8 o’clock, and that the lacerations could have been caused by the
penetration of a male organ.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

accused-appellant’s assertion of the impossibility of rape being committed as
his penis was just “attached” to his daughter’s labia is plain nonsense.  His daughter would NOT have cried out in
pain IF it were otherwise.  Denial is
the weakest defense and will not prosper against a positive testimony
identifying accused-appellant as the person who had sexual intercourse with the
victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
