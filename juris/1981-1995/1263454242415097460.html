				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case was certified to this Tribunal by the Court of Appeals
for final determination pursuant to Section 3, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"</span>x x x On
January 11, 1977, appel足lant filed a petition with the Court of First Instance
of Rizal for the probate of the holographic will of Ricardo B. Bonilla and the
issuance of letters testamentary in her favor.  The petition, docketed as Sp. Proc. No. 8432, was opposed by the
appellees Amparo Aranza <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Bonilla,
Wilferine Bonilla Treyes, Expedita Bonilla Frias and Ephraim Bonilla on the
following grounds:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>Appellant
was estopped from claiming that the deceased left a will by failing to produce
the will within twenty days of the death of the tes足tator as required by Rule
75, section 2 of the Rules of Court;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>The
alleged copy of the alleged holographic will did not contain a disposition of
property after death and was not intended to take effect after death, and
therefore it was not a will;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>The
alleged holographic will itself, and not an alleged copy thereof, must be
produced, otherwise it would produce no effect, as held in <u>Gan</u> <u>v</u>.
<u>Yap</u>, 104 Phil. 509; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>The
deceased did not leave any will, holographic or otherwise, executed and attested
as required by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellees likewise moved for the consolidation of the
case with another case (Sp. Proc. No. 8275).  Their motion was granted by the court in an order dated April 4, 1977.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On November 13, 1978, following the consolidation of the
cases, the appellees moved again to dismiss the petition for the probate of the
will.  They argued that:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>The
alleged holographic was not a last will but merely an instruction as to the
management and improvement of the schools and colleges founded by decedent
Ricardo B. Bonilla; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">"(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span></span>Lost
or destroyed holographic wills cannot be proved by secondary evidence unlike
ordinary wills.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon opposition of the appellant, the motion to dismiss was
denied by the court in its order of February 23, 1979.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The appellees then filed a motion for reconsideration on the
ground that the order was contrary to law and settled pronouncements and
rulings of the Supreme Court, to which the appellant in turn filed an
opposition.  On July 23, 1979, the court
set aside its order of February 23, 1979 and dismissed the petition for the
probate of the will of Ricardo B. Bonilla.  The court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'. . .  It is our considered
opinion that once the original copy of the holographic will is lost, a copy
thereof cannot stand in lieu of the original.</p>

<p class="2Q">'In the case of Gan vs. Yap, 104 Phil. 509, 522, the Supreme Court
held that 'in the matter of holographic wills the law, it is reasonable to
suppose, regards the document itself as the material proof of authenticity of
said wills.'</p>

<p class="2Q">'MOREOVER, this Court notes that the alleged holographic will was
executed on January 25, 1962 while Ricardo B. Bonilla died on May 13,
1976.  In view of the lapse of more than
14 years from the time of the execution of the will to the death of the decedent,
the fact that the original of the will could not be located shows to our mind
that the decedent had discarded before his death his allegedly missing
Holographic Will.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Appellant's motion for
reconsideration was denied.  Hence, an
appeal to the Court of Appeals in which it is contended that the dismissal of
appellant's petition is contrary to law and well-settled jurisprudence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On July 7, 1980,
appellees moved to forward the case to this Court on the ground that the appeal
does not involve question of fact and alleged that the trial court committed
the following assigned errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT A LOST
HOLOGRAPHIC WILL MAY NOT BE PROVED BY A COPY THEREOF;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE
LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DECEDENT HAS DISCARDED BEFORE HIS DEATH
THE MISSING HOLO足GRAPHIC WILL;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN DISMISSING
APPELLANT's WILL."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only question here is whether a holographic will which was
lost or cannot be found can be proved by means of a photostatic copy.  Pursuant to Article 811 of the Civil Code,
probate of holographic wills is the allowance of the will by the court after
its due execution has been proved.  The
probate may be uncontested or not.  If
un足contested, at least one identifying witness is required and, if no witness
is available, experts may be resorted to.  If contested, at least three identifying witnesses are required.  However, if the holographic will has been
lost or destroyed and no other copy is available, the will can not be probated
because the best and only evidence is the handwriting of the testator in said
will.  It is necessary that there be a
comparison between sample handwritten statements of the testator and the
handwritten will.  But a photostatic
copy or xerox copy of the holographic will may be allowed because comparison
can be made with the standard writings of the testator.  In the case of Gan vs. Yap, 104 Phil. 509,
the Court ruled that "the execution and the contents of a lost or
destroyed holographic will may not be proved by the bare testimony of witnesses
who have seen and/or read such will.  The will itself must be presented; otherwise, it shall produce no
effect.  The law regards the document
itself as material proof of authenticity." But, in Footnote 8 of said
decision, it says that "Perhaps it may be proved by a photographic or
photostatic copy.  Even a mimeographed
or carbon copy; or by other similar means, if any, whereby the authenticity of
the handwriting of the deceased may be exhibited and tested before the probate
court." Evidently, the photostatic or xerox copy of the lost or destroyed
holographic will may be admitted because then the authenticity of the
handwriting of the deceased can be determined by the probate court.</p>
