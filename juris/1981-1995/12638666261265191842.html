				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An analysis of the private respondent's claims discloses their
utter lack of support from the facts on record; yet he has somehow succeeded in
delaying the just denouement of his specious demands and even in persuading the
Intermediate Appellate Court to grant him a remedy to which he was clearly not
entitled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Relief to the petitioner is
clearly indicated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their lifetime, the spouses Pedro and <span class="SpellE">Matilde</span>
Lim were the owners in fee simple of two parcels of land covered by OCT No.
RP-3 and TCT No. T-522 of the Registry of Deeds for <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These lots they mortgaged to the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP) under deeds dated <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1961</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1963" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1963</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The mortgage contracts contained a stipulation requiring consent of the DBP to
any transfer of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1968</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> sold the lots to the Spouses Miguel and <span class="SpellE">Escolastica</span> <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span>, who assumed
the mortgage obligation burdening the property in favor of the DBP.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Approval of the transaction having been subsequently given by the DBP,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the <span class="SpellE">Paguios</span> obtained titles to the property in their
names, TCT Nos. 7844 and 7845.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Annotated
on the titles was the mortgage of the DBP, inclusive of the explicit
requirement, already mentioned, that any transfer of the mortgaged property
required the consent of the DBP.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the <span class="SpellE">Paguios</span> failed to pay the
balance of the price to the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>, the latter sued
them for the recovery thereof in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The suit ended in a compromise agreement which was approved by the Court and
embodied in its judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The judgment enjoined the parties to comply with their compromise agreement in
good faith, “subject * * to the liens which the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may have in the properties in question.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In virtue thereof the <span class="SpellE">Paguios</span>, by deed dated <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1973</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
the two (2) lots to the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Some three weeks afterwards, the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>
executed a "Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage" dated <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1973</st1:date>, conveying the same
two (2) lots to Angel Bautista (private respondent herein).<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Since the transaction did not count with the consent of DBP, what Bautista did
was to send a letter on the same day to the Manager of the DBP Branch at <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Clodualdo</span> Reyes,
submitting the deed for consideration and approval, asking for an extension of
at least 120 days to settle the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>' mortgage
indebtedness or negotiate for the restructuring thereof, and promising to pay
the mortgage debt in full as soon as he received the price of a subdivision he
was then selling.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1974</st1:date>, Bautista
wrote another letter to the DBP, requesting that he be furnished with the
statement of account of the late Pedro Lim, and undertaking to pay that account
in full as soon as he received payment of the price of a subdivision he was
selling in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

On <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1974</st1:date>, Bautista
once more communicated with the DBP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
declared that although more than a year had passed since he sent his letter of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1973</st1:date> to the DBP, he had
"not received any answer from you or your staff." He added that if
his request had been approved, he should be informed of the schedule of
payments expected of him so "we can adjust our finances"; but that if
the transaction had been disapproved, he was ready to pay in full the mortgage debt
"which we have already assumed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1974</st1:date>,
DBP Branch Manager Reyes sent Bautista a letter specifically in response to the
latter's request for information about the statement of account of Pedro Lim,
who had since died, and his (Bautista's) offer to assume and liquidate the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reyes stated that the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> had not "officially assumed the mortgage of the
spouses Miguel <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Your <span class="SpellE">privity</span> with
the DBP would be based on the contract with the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>,
which we in fact recommended but was not approved based on the credit findings
of our Credit Department on your financial and credit standings." The
Manager went on to say that the Lim account was already with the Bank's Legal
Division for foreclosure, and the Bank could not accede to Bautista's request
(for restructuring or payment) which it considered "without valid and
legal basis under existing rules."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As Manager Reyes had warned, foreclosure of the mortgage on the
lots in question was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> effected on
account of the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>' failure to pay their
indebtedness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the foreclosure sale,
conducted on <st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1974</st1:date>,
the property was auctioned off to the DBP as the highest bidder.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Prior thereto, notices of the extrajudicial foreclosure sale, dated <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1974</st1:date>, were served on the
Spouses Lim and the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the same notices were posted,
from June 25 to date of sale, in the old public market, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Post</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Office</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

<p class="BODY">After the lapse of more than a year, with neither the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> nor the <span class="SpellE">Paguios</span> coming forth
to redeem the foreclosed property, the DBP consolidated its ownership over the
lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This it did on <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, TCT Nos. 7844 and 7845 were
cancelled, and new ones issued to DBP, numbered 13329 and 13330.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As for Bautista, from the time that he received Manager Reyes’
letter of <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1974</st1:date>, and
for a period of more than five (5) years thereafter, he did nothing towards
vindicating any claim to the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bautista was next heard from after a company named <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Allied Ventures Co., hereafter simply LAVCO,
offered on <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1979</st1:date>
to buy the two parcels of land from DBP and deposited P280,000.00 with it as
earnest money.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Having apparently gotten wind of the transaction, Bautista filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1979</st1:date> a complaint with
the Court of first Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte
against the DBP, the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del
Norte and the Register of Deeds for "annulment of extra-judicial
foreclosure of mortgage, certificate of sale, consolidation of ownership,
damages, with prayer for preliminary injunction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1979</st1:date>,
DBP executed in <span class="SpellE">LAVCO's</span> favor a Deed of Conditional
Sale of the two parcels of land, including the buildings thereon and the
chattels therein.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The price set was P1,400,000.00 of which P280,000.00 had been earlier deposited
with the DBP, as already mentioned.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Bautista's complaint was eventually dismissed by the Trial Court
by Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1982</st1:date>,
after a preliminary hearing at <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> instance on the
affirmative defenses set out in its Answer, and after submission of evidence
and relevant pleadings by the parties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court found that:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) as regards the alleged sale by the Lim Spouses to Bautista,
the transaction on which the latter relies for his claims to the property,
"there was no actual consideration given by Angel L. Bautista to the said
spouses," hence the sale was void as being "absolutely simulated or
fictitious;"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(2) there was no written consent given by the DBP to that sale by
the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span> to Bautista, in violation of <i>“<span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de non <span class="SpellE">alienando</span>"</i>
in the mortgage contracts, i.e., that the "mortgagor shall not sell,
dispose of, mortgage, nor in any manner encumber the mortgaged property,
without the written consent of the Mortgagee;"</p>

<p class="BODY">(3) the extrajudicial foreclosure "proceedings and the
certificate of sale were effected with all the formalities, in consonance with
the requirements of he law;" and</p>

<p class="BODY">(4) Bautista was definitely aware of the mortgages in favor of
the DBP, and of the scheduled foreclosure sale but did not take part in the
bidding or otherwise attempt to settle the mortgage obligation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court accordingly ruled that Bautista's action had
"no leg to stand on," and he had "miserably failed to establish
his legal right of ownership over the mortgaged properties;" that, in
other words, he had "no cause of action and, therefore, ** <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> motion to dismiss ** (the) complaint should be **
GRANTED."</p>

<p class="BODY">Bautista's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his
complaint was denied by Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="10">October
 7, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the action was going on, and presumably in the expectation
that it might end in an amicable settlement, National Steel Corporation
(hereafter simply NSC) somehow came to negotiate with Bautista for the purchase
of the lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Bautista and NSC came to an
agreement in consideration of the price of P1,520,659.20, conditioned upon an
amicable settlement being reached in said pending action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this basis, Bautista filed a motion with
the Court asking that NSC be granted authority to deposit the price with the
DBP, to await final disposition of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The DBP manifested that it had no objection to such a deposit being made
with it, but emphasized that its consent thereto was not an admission of any
right on the part of Bautista in the lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">NSC also negotiated, and ultimately entered into a contract with
LAVCO for the purchase of one of the latter's lots, that covered by TCT No.
13330.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It paid the stipulated price to LAVCO from which, in turn, LAVCO paid to DBP
the sum of P1,059,307.82 in connection with their Deed of Conditional Sale of <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1979</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

LAVCO thereafter took possession of the property, and its right of possession
was subsequently upheld by the Court of Agrarian Relations in a decision
rendered on <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1981</st1:date>
in a case brought by a tenant against LAVCO (CAR Case No. 117 [<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>],

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1982</st1:date>
Bautista appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court from the Trial Court's
above mentioned Order of <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1982</st1:date>

<p class="BODY">2) "the prayer of <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Allied

this appeal."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another Resolution of the same Court, dated May 10, 1985,
required DBP "to comply with the ** resolution promulgated on January 14,
1985 ordering said bank to deposit to this Court all monies, income, etc. of
the property in question."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1985</st1:date>,
Bautista presented a "Manifestation" in relation to the Resolution of
<st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1985</st1:date> (requiring
deposit of "all monies ** or proceeds of the properties subject matter of
this case").<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
The manifestation's avowed purpose was "to help ** (the Court of Appeals)
in arriving at the proper amounts or incomes to be deposited to this Honorable
court by defendant DBP and all persons or entities claiming right under them
(DBP) particularly <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> Allied Ventures company
and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>."
It specified what Bautista evidently believed were the amounts that should be
so deposited, including the down payment of P280,000.00 made by LAVCO to DBP,
the proceeds of the extrajudicial foreclosure sale of December 13, 1983 in the
sum of P1,059,307.82, other amounts received by LAVCO as share in the harvest
received from "tenant-overseer" Jose <span class="SpellE">Campong</span>,
and "rice milling and warehousing (fees) from the rice mill of the
properties subject of the case," etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Intermediate Appellate Court required DBP to comment; the latter
moved for an extension of time to comply since it had not been furnished a copy
of Bautista's manifestation; DBP was finally given a copy of the manifestation
on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1985</st1:date>, after
which it submitted its comment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment dated <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="7">July
 29, 1985</st1:date>, DBP disputed Bautista's averments.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

It pointed out, among other things, that Bautista's claim to the property in
question was "anchored on an alleged deed of sale with assumption of
mortgage in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> DBP," but since
Bautista "never paid the loans secured by such mortgages" the same
were foreclosed, and he had done nothing for some six (6) years thereafter to
pay those obligations; that the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, and all
income thereafter derived from the property rightfully pertained to DBP and its
successor-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was "on account of the above-mentioned resolutions ** of
the respondent Appellate Court," to wit:</p>

<blockquote>1) of January 14, 1985, ordering "defendant DBP and any or all
persons or entities claiming under them (DBP) to deposit ** all monies,
incomes, harvest or proceeds of the properties subject matter of this case
covered by TCT Nos. T-7844 (<span class="SpellE">a.f</span>.) and 7845 (<span class="SpellE">a.f</span>.),"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2) of <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1985</st1:date>,
"denying the petitioner's 'Motion for Reconsideration' without citing the
facts and legal grounds on which such denial was anchored," and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3) of <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1985</st1:date>,
requiring DBP to comply with the resolution of <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="1">January 14, 1985</st1:date>,<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">which resolutions, according to
petitioner DBP, "may soon be implemented," that it "commenced
the present petition" in this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The recourse to this Court by petitioner DBP might in a sense be
deemed somewhat precipitate; but this aspect of the case may be disregarded as
of no real significance since the merit of its cause otherwise appears plain
and patent upon the record, and its consequent entitlement to relief clear and
of no little urgency.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should have been evident to the Intermediate Appellate Court,
in light of the material facts before it, and now before this Court, that
Bautista had absolutely no right over the property in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the record indisputably shows that -</p>

<p class="BODY">1) as Bautista was well aware, the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of the sale of the property to him by the Lim Spouses on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1973</st1:date> was conditioned on the approval
thereof by the DBP, the holder of a mortgage thereon;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) Bautista failed to obtain <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span>
consent to the sale; in fact, he was advised that his request for approval
thereof had been denied based on the unsatisfactory state of his
"financial and credit standings;"</p>

<p class="BODY">3) the mortgage on the property was thereafter <span class="SpellE">extrajudically</span> foreclosed on account of the mortgagor's
(the <span class="SpellE">Lims</span>') failure to pay the mortgage debt;</p>

<p class="BODY">4) at no time before or after the foreclosure did Bautista offer
to pay the mortgage obligation; indeed, the one-year period for redemption
expired without his being heard from at all;</p>

<p class="BODY">5) then, too, for a period of five (5) years or so after the
foreclosure sale and the consolidation of title in favor of the highest bidder,
the DBP, Bautista made no effort whatever towards prosecuting his alleged claim
to the property;</p>

<p class="BODY">6) no act of recognition, or generation, of any right in
Bautista's favor over the property was ever executed by DBP or the latter's
subsequent transferees; the agreement between Bautista and the National Steel
Corporation, which at the time did not itself have any right over the property
-- and which was subject to any contingent amicable settlement, which however
never materialized -- was quite obviously, totally ineffectual to invest
Bautista with any right over said property.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was thus no justification whatsoever for the Intermediate
Appellate Court to order -- on Bautista's motion and for his benefit --
"DBP and any or all persons or entities claiming under them (DBP) ** to
deposit ** (with it) all monies, incomes, harvest or proceeds of the properties
subject matter of the case and covered by TCT Nos. T-7844 (<span class="SpellE">a.f</span>.)
and T-7845 (<span class="SpellE">a.f</span>.)." In doing so, that Court
acted whimsically, capriciously, oppressively and despotically.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It made dispositions with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, causing serious injury to the
parties whose rights over the property in question are as clear and
unquestionable on the record as Bautista's lack thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">These conclusions having been reached, this case should
ordinarily end in this Court simply with the nullification of the challenged
resolutions of the respondent Court and the remand of the case to the latter
for resolution of the appeal taken to it by Bautista.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that all the material
facts necessary for a determination on the merits of that appeal, have already
been laid before, and duly reviewed and assessed by, this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court perceives no cogent reason why the
case may not now be adjudicated on its merits in this Court, conformably with
the conclusions just mentioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the circumstances, a remand of the case to the respondent Court would be
unnecessary, and result merely in undue deferment of the final disposition of
the controversy, already long delayed.</p>

<p class="BODY">One other factor additionally demonstrates the correctness of the
course of action just indicated, and that is, the fact that Bautista has
indulged in “forum shopping.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">DBP's</span> "Opposition to
Manifestation and Motion" dated May 9, 1989, it asserted that after
Bautista had appealed to the Court of Appeals from the adverse judgment rendered
by the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City in
Civil Case No. 1282-79 (II-660), he filed on January 8, 1983, “another case
with the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> Regional Trial Court, this time
denominated as Specific Performance but alleging the same things as his
complaint in the case filed with then CFI <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City
Branch II FROM WHENCE THIS PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> ORIGINATES.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To this pleading of DBP, Bautista filed on <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1989</st1:date> an undated reply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In it, Bautista did not deny that he did file
the second action; on the contrary, he tacitly admitted having done so but
averred that that act of his did not constitute forum shopping.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
This is what he says:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>No forum-shopping</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The interim rules of court provides (sic):</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SEC.17.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitions for writs
of <i>certiorari</i>, etc., - No petition for <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i>,
prohibition, habeas corpus or quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span> may be
filed in the Intermediate Appellate Court if another similar petition has been
filed or is still pending in the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor may such petition be filed (in the Supreme Court if a similar
petition has been filed) or is still pending in the Intermediate Appellate
Court (unless it be to review the action taken by the Intermediate Appellate
Court) on the petition (filed) with it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A violation of this rule shall constitute contempt of court and shall be
a cause for the summary dismissal of both petitions, without prejudice to the
taking of appropriate action against the counsel or party concerned.'</p>

<blockquote>We take exception to the wild view of petitioner that the acts of
private respondent falls (sic) under the aforementioned provisions of the law
and existing jurisprudence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But "existing jurisprudence" does not justify
characterizing petitioner's view as "wild," as Bautista does; it does
not limit forum shopping to actions or proceedings in the same court, as he
seems to think.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in line with the
principle adverted to by Bautista himself, case law sustains the power of the
Courts to condemn and sanction the institution of an action or proceeding
raising (otherwise than by due appeal) the same basic issues as another still
pending, or already disposed of by the same or another court, by a party in
both actions or proceedings, regardless of the courts involved, that act being
deemed contumacious as an abuse of the processes of the Court, and as
professional misconduct on the part of a lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><i>Pacquing</i></span><i> v. CA</i>, 115
SCRA 117, 123 (1982) the Court declared litigants deserving of reprimand
"who frustrate the speedy administration of justice by resorting to all
available means to get from one court what is denied them by another, ** as
well as their counsel who assist in such undesirable conduct in grave violation
of the lawyer's oath of office." Similarly, in <span class="SpellE"><i>Vda</i></span><i>.
de <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Yrad</span>, Jr.</i>,
133 SCRA 727-731 (1984), the penalty of severe censure was imposed for the
contumacious act of a lawyer in filing a petition in the Court of Appeals
thirty days after filing a similar petition in this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <i>Minister of Natural Resources v. Heirs
of <span class="SpellE">Orval</span> Hughes, et al.</i>, 155 SCRA 566 (1987), it
was ruled that the parties' "resort to forum shopping, to the filing of
repetitious suits in different courts not only furnishes ground for giving
their present action short shrift, but also lays the foundation for an inquiry
into their liability for constructive contempt for having abused the processes
of the courts, and their counsel's own liability for the same sanction and such
other additional administrative responsibility as might be proper in the
premises.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a></p>
