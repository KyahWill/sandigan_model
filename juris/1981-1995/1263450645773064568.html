reconsideration of the decision of this Court rendered on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Comment thereon was filed by private respondents under date of <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1981</st1:date> and a reply of
petitioners dated <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1981</st1:date>
to <span class="GramE">said</span> comment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the foregoing pleadings, the Court studied carefully
and deliberated maturely on the following considerations:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Originally, petitioners
filed the petition in <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. L-17859 for review
under Republic Act 5440 only of the partial summary judgment of the trial court
of September 22, 1977 and the subsequent order of said court of November 8,
1977 for the immediate execution of its partial judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, that appeal was purely on questions
of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, upon agreement of the
parties during the hearing on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1979</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> issued an order on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1979</st1:date>, modifying an earlier
restraining order We had issued, by allowing the trial court to proceed with
the hearing of the whole case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still
later, on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1979</st1:date>, <span class="GramE">We</span> resolved to permit the trial court to render judgment,
provided it should not order execution thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the trial court
rendered final judgment on <st1:date year="1979" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1979</st1:date>,
petitioners herein perfected an appeal to the Court of Appeals which was
docketed therein as CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 65677.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under date of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1979</st1:date>, respondents filed

of CA-<span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. 65677 in order that the same may be
treated by <span class="GramE">Us</span> also as an appeal under Republic Act

petitioners filed the following:</p>

Annex B to the complaint; and</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioners are not precluded from

consideration of the cases at bar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the interest of a speedy and fair
administration of justice, petitioners hereby conform to the instant
motion." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 754-755, Record.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that
petitioners qualified their conformity to the consolidation proposed by
respondents by stating that "petitioners are not precluded from raising
other issues, both legal and <u>factual</u>, etc.", in resolving the
questions of fact We cannot but give due consideration to the findings of the
trial court sustained by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, whatever issues petitioners have claimed in their brief as well
as in their motion for reconsideration to be of fact are actually legal
questions, for all that they ask of Us is to interpret, construe or otherwise
evaluate the legal import of documents that are in the records and in this
connection.</p>

<p class="BODY">For instance, in one portion of the trial court's decision, it
found and held:</p>

<blockquote>"5. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span> and SAN
MAURICIO contend that Proclamation 500, and for that matter <span class="SpellE">P.D</span>.
837, should be construed to respect existing private rights claiming that <span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span> by a series of transactions had acquired existing
mining rights under the Philippine Bill of 1902.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>We consider the evidence presented in
support of the claim as not competent because it does not sufficiently show how
<span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span> or SAN MAURICIO acquired said rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there is no proof as to who was in
possession of the property upon the passage of the Philippine Bill of 1902 and
the <span class="SpellE">successional</span> rights thereto from 1902 to the
present</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But
assuming, however, that SAN MAURICIO, as predecessor-in-interest of <span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span> had some interest in the land prior to 1957, that
interest was conveyed or sold by SAN MAURICIO to <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span>
by the Contract of Sale and Assignment of Rights of 1957.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may be true that in 1973, <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> resold the same property or right of SAN MAURICIO
and the latter was succeeded thereto by <span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span>, it
is equally true that at the time of the sale on November 23, 1973, <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> was merely an administrator of the property under
Proclamation No. 500, Series of 1968 and it had no authority to sell or dispose
of the land or any interest therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendants cannot disclaim knowledge of the effects of Proclamation No.
500 and/or its provisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should
know or ought to have known that on <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="11">November
 23, 1973</st1:date> said Proclamation was still in effect, not having been
repealed and/or recalled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Proclamation on said date is an indisputable
proof that the Office of the President could not have approved the supposed <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C-2) for the simple reason
that a Deed of Sale or Assignment of Rights cannot repeal and/or adversely
affect a Proclamation.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"With respect to the contract of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 26, 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C-8), we have already
discussed on it earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
believes that its findings and conclusions with respect to said contract
applies with greater force in disposing of the argument of <span class="SpellE">MARSMAN</span>
as to its right under the Philippine Bill of 1902.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, as the Court has pointed out, the approval of the
Contract of Sale with Assignment of Rights of <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C-2) by
the then Assistant Executive Secretary, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
B. Zamora, is a forgery and no right could spring <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
no obligations were created as if no contract was executed by the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The contract on the other
hand, the contract of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 26, 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C-8) is subject to the right of the government
to withdraw at anytime from the assignee the use of surface rights in the land
subject matter of said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was withdrawn by <span class="SpellE">P.D</span>. 837 when it vested in <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> absolute ownership of the land covered by it and
authorized <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> to sell or dispose of the land
either by public bidding or by negotiation, as <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span>
did with the sale thereof to SMELTERS on <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1975</st1:date>." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 742-743,
Record, underscoring Ours.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We cannot take the above conclusions of the trial court
lightly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True it is that the matter of
whether or not the signature of Secretary Zamora was a forgery or not and
whether or not there was in fact an approval by Secretary Reyes of the 1975
document may be deemed as involving weighing of the respective evidence of the
parties, but aside from Our view expressed in Our decision as well as elsewhere
in this resolution that, at any rate, if indeed there were such approvals by
Secretaries Zamora and Reyes, the transactions purportedly sanctioned by them
are in law <u>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our own appraisal of the evidence on these
factual matters is that the same preponderates in favor of respondents'
position in regard thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of these considerations, and after giving due
attention and studying the arguments of the parties in the pleadings
aforementioned, the Court resolved to DENY petitioners' motion for
reconsideration on the following grounds <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That this Court took into account Appendix A
of respondent SMELTERS' brief reading <u>verbatim</u> as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">cannot</span>
constitute a denial neither of due process nor of an opportunity on the part of
petitioners to be heard as to the true import thereof.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The document in question was petitioners'
main actionable document to bolster their defense that therein or together
therewith there was a collateral agreement that <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span>
would resell "surface" rights to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the bringing out of the said
document by any party at any later stage of the proceedings could not have
caught petitioners by surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
under the rules, petitioners should have attached the same to their
answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Section 7, Rule 8) Instead, in
an allegation which, to put it mildly, could mislead any court, in paragraph
XXVIII of their answer they alleged, in relation to the deed of November 19,
1957 in question, the following:</p>

<blockquote>"That on November 19, 1957, defendant SAN MAURICIO MINING
COMPANY executed in favor of <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> a Deed of
Absolute Sale of the <u><span style="">surface rights</span></u><span style=""> </span>over 144.62 hectares of land covering
its twenty mineral claims in Jose <span class="SpellE">Panganiban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, together with all the improvements
thereon, subject to a collateral understanding between them to the effect that
when <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> stops the operation of the smelting plant
thereon, or, abandons the site, SAN MAURICIO would have the first option to
reacquire from <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> the surface rights over its
said mineral claims and all the improvements thereon." (Underscoring Ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">thereby referring very distinctly and
definitely <span style="">to </span>the object of the
transaction as only "<u>surface rights</u>", when the naked truth is
that the text of the agreement, as can be read above does not even mention
surface rights anywhere within its four corners.</p>

<p class="BODY">If, as petitioners now contend, they could have shown at the
trial that the said document did not express the true intent and agree­ment of
the parties they should have made such allegation then, were they really candid
with the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule, such allegation of failure of a
document to express the true intent of the parties must be alleged in the
pleadings as an indispensable predicate for the presentation of any evidence to
such effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it is not sufficient
excuse for the omission of petitioners to make such allegation in their answer
that in its own complaint Smelters pre­mised its causes of action on the deeds
of <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1973</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C-2) and </span><st1:date year="1975" day="26" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 26, 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> C-8) therein referred to,
for evidently, as We understand respondent's theory in its complaint, the reference
to said later documents was made only as premise in order to attack their
intrinsic legal import in the light of Proclamation 500 and Presidential Decree
837, and, alternatively, albeit hypothetically, to invoke the right of the
government therein to withdraw what had been <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span>
to petitioners by <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the essence of denial of due process cannot contemplate
a situation wherein the party who has knowledge of and holds a document that
would bring out the truth as to a given situation withholds such document,
whether as a matter of forensic strategy or bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due process is no more than the indispensability
of fairness and opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Understandably then, it cannot be pretended that there has been denial
thereof in a situation where precisely, as a matter of candidness and honesty
to the court, <span style="">the </span>party claiming
to be aggrieved is the one who for tactical reasons or otherwise is the one
guilty of not disclosing to the court the vital document that contains the most
conclusive evidence regarding the matter in dispute.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As held in Our decision, it is to Us, at most
of only secondary significance to dwell on the issue of whether or not the said
1973 and 1975 documents were approved by the Office of the President, albeit
Our appraisal of the evidence, with due respect to the arguments of
distinguished counsel of petitioners, that Secretary <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
Zamora's signature is a forgery and the alleged approval supposedly signed by
Secretary Roberto Reyes has not been satisfactorily proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And truth to tell, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are in the dark as to how those latter documents came to mention "surface
rights".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only explanation We
could gather from the record, and in the absence of direct evidence on the part
of peti­tioners that the 1957 document did not intend to mean what it says, is
that the government officials who took part in the preparation of the 1973 and
1975 documents invoked by petitioners acted on the basis of an erroneous
assumption, which error cannot in law bind the state on a matter adversely
affecting the proprietary rights of the government.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To Our mind, the contention of petitioners'
counsel that the subsequent acts of <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> prove the
failure of the 1957 document to express the true intent of the parties cannot
be better supported in a new trial, since under the provisions of Proclamation
500, <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> was a mere administrator of the
properties in question and any actuation thereof bartering away the rights of the
state under the clear terms of the 1957 document cannot be but <u>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u>, if not erroneous, hence not binding on the
government and people of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it may be noted that seemingly,
Smelters' position in the latter stages of the proceedings appear rather
variant from the allegations in its complaint, but We are not told and We have
not found in the record any indication that such change or alteration, if there
was in essence any, of Smelters' fundamental causes of action, was ever
objected to by petitioners, so much so that when, quite unnecessarily (from the
point of view of Section 5 of Rule 10 providing that "failure to so amend
does not affect the result of the trial of these issues"), respondent
filed a motion to amend its complaint in order to make a portion thereof <span class="GramE">conform</span> with the evidence it had <span class="SpellE">unopposedly</span>
offered, no wonder said motion for such amendment was allowed.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 45pt; text-indent: -23.4pt;">(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As to the prayer that these cases be referred
to the Court <u>en banc</u> on the ground that a question of unconstitutionality
is involved, it is quite clear, as We have already explained, that the factual
premises for the attack on constitutional grounds has not been established by
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, Our conclusions
of fact that the properties in question, including the mines, were acquired by <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> on November 19, 1957 and was never reacquired
validly by petitioners leads necessarily to the conclusion that <span class="SpellE">P.D</span>. 837 does not deprive the petitioners of any property
at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the premise for
the issue of whether or not <span class="SpellE">P.D</span>. 837 is
unconstitutional to arise has not been established.</p>

<p class="BODY">The long and short of the merits of these cases is that
petitioners would want Us to hold, without complying with the prerequisites of
the rule on pleadings on the point, and without convincing evidence before Us
or any that they could possibly present in a new trial,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
that Presidential Decree No. 837 deprives them of property without due process
of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there would have been
such deprivation, if from the evidence on record it appeared convincingly that
the properties in dispute were still owned by petitioners when <span class="SpellE">P.D</span>. 837 was issued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as <span class="GramE">We</span> have found and explained above, such
is not the fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the Deed of Absolute
Sale of <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1957</st1:date>,
petitioners sold their mining rights to <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners omitted to allege and prove at
the trial that said document did not mean what it says.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And now, on the basis of subsequent
actuations of officials which <span class="GramE">We</span> hold to be <u><span style="">ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>petitioners claim the said
properties were <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, petitioners have the right to contend
and argue that their evidence proves their position, but <span class="GramE">We</span>
reject any attempt to impose upon this Court a theory that is plainly wanting
in basis under the rules of pleading and evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resort to the basic principle of right to
be heard and denial of due process, as <span class="GramE">We</span> have already
ex­plained, lacks basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> see it, petitioners are now trying desperately to make it
appear that legally the production of the Deed of Absolute Sale of <st1:date year="1957" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1957</st1:date> which reveals what
really was acquired by <span class="SpellE">NASSCO</span> <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
was only surface rights was incum­bent upon Smelters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without necessarily accusing petitioners of
bad faith, it is to Our mind indisputable that even dis­regarding the rule on
actionable documents, if only as a matter of <span style="">fair play and </span>placing all cards on the table without any hidden
ace, petitioners should have revealed to the trial court said document by
properly attaching or copying the same in their answer, with the appropriate
allegation, if such is indeed what happened, that the same failed to express
the real intent of the parties, and thereafter supporting such allegation by
competent evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is too late in
the day now to correct that omission by beclouding the issue with an invocation
of denial of an opportunity to be heard, which, to be sure, they were the ones
who refrained to avail of such opportunity to themselves for reasons of their
own.<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Premises considered, the subject motion for reconsideration of
petitioners is hereby DENIED for lack of merit, and if the Court has taken
pains in this resolution to once more discuss the same issues already raised
before Our decision was rendered, it is only to place said decision in clearer
light and to set aright, if possible, petitioners' perspectives in regard
thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">This denial is FINAL.</p>

A careful reading of petitioners' brief and motion for reconsideration and
rejoinder indicates that they rely mostly on documents already in evidence and
which We say are <u><span style="">ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></span></u><span style="">, </span>hence
no amount of supposed admissions of Smelters or <span class="SpellE">Nassco</span>
in regard thereto can in law improve their invalidity and inefficacy, the
object or subject matter in issue herein being portions of the public domain.</p>
