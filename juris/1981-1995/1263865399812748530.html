				<H3>NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY AND NEW AGRIX, INC., PETITIONERS, VS. PHILIPPINE VETERANS BANK, THE EX-OFFICIO SHERIFF AND GODOFREDO QUILING, IN HIS CAPACITY AS DEPUTY SHERIFF OF CALAMBA, LAGUNA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case involves the constitutionality of a presidential decree
which, like <span style="">all </span>other issuances
of President Marcos during his regime, was at that time regarded as
sacrosanct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only now, <span style="">in a freer </span>atmosphere, that his acts
are being tested by the touchstone of the fundamental law that even then was
supposed to limit presidential action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The particular enactment in question is Pres. Decree No. 1717,
which ordered the rehabilitation <span class="GramE">of</span> the <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span> Group of Companies to be administered mainly by the
National Development Company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
outlined the procedure for filing claims against the <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>
companies and created a Claims Committee to process these claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Especially relevant to this case, and noted
at the outset, is Sec. 4(1) thereof providing that "all mortgages and
other liens presently attaching to any of the assets of the dissolved
corporations are hereby extinguished."</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, the <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span> Marketing, Inc.
(AGRIX) had executed in favor of private respondent Philippine Veterans Bank a
real estate mortgage dated July 7, 1978, over three (3) parcels of land
situated in Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>, Laguna.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the existence of the mortgage, AGRIX
went bankrupt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was for the expressed
purpose of salvaging this and the other <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>
companies that the aforementioned decree was issued by President Marcos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant thereto, the private respondent filed a claim with the
AGRIX Claims Committee for the payment of its loan credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the New <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>,
Inc. and the National Development Company, petitioners herein, invoking Sec. 4
(1) of the decree, filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna, for the cancellation of the mortgage lien
in favor of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
its part, the private respondent took steps to <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
foreclose the mortgage, prompting the petitioners to file a second case with
the same court to stop the foreclosure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two cases were consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission by the parties of their respective
pleadings, the trial court rendered the impugned decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Francisco Ma. Guerrero annulled not
only the challenged provision, <u>viz</u>., Sec. 4 (1), but the entire Pres.
Decree No. 1717 on the grounds that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the presidential exercise of legislative power was a violation of the principle
of separation of powers; (2) the law impaired the obligation of contracts; and
(3) the decree violated the equal protection clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration of this
decision having been denied, the present petition was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition was originally assigned to the Third Division of
this Court but because of the constitutional questions involved it was
transferred to the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court granted the petitioner's prayer for a temporary restraining order and
instructed the respondents to cease and desist from conducting a <span style="">public </span>auction sale of the lands in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the Solicitor General
and the private respondent had filed their comments and the petitioners their
reply, the Court gave due course to the petition and ordered the parties to
file simultaneous memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
compliance by the parties, the case was deemed submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that the private respondent is now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from contesting the validity of the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In support of this contention, it cites the
recent case of <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span> Marketing, Inc.,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
where the constitutionality of Pres. Decree No. 1717 <span style="">was </span>also raised but not resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, after noting that the petitioners
had already filed their claims with the AGRIX Claims Committee created by the
decree, had simply dismissed the petition on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="GramE">petitioners</span> stress that in the case
at bar the private respondent also invoked the provisions of Pres. Decree No.
1717 by filing a claim with the AGRIX Claims Committee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing to get results, it sought to
foreclose the real estate mortgage executed by AGRIX in its favor, which had
been extinguished by the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only
when the petitioners challenged the foreclosure on the basis of Sec. 4 (1) of
the decree, that the private respondent attacked the validity of the
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that stage, however,
consistent with <st1:city><st1:place><u>Mendoza</u></st1:place></st1:city>, the
private respondent was already <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
questioning the constitutionality of the decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court does not agree that the principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that the private respondent did file a claim
with the AGRIX Claims Committee pursuant to this decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted, however, that this was done
in 1980, when President Marcos was the absolute ruler of this country and his
decrees were the absolute law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
judicial challenge to them would have been futile, not to say foolhardy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent, no less than the rest
of the nation, was aware of that reality and knew it had no choice under the
circumstances but to conform.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there were a few venturesome souls who dared to
question the dictator's decisions before the courts of justice then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record will show, however, that not a
single act or issuance of President Marcos was ever declared unconstitutional,
not even by the highest court, as long as he was in power.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To rule now that the private respondent is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> for having abided with the decree instead of
boldly assailing it is to close our eyes to a cynical fact of life during that
repressive time.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case must be distinguished from <st1:city><st1:place><u>Mendoza</u></st1:place></st1:city>,
where the petitioners, after filing their claims with the AGRIX Claims
Committee, received in settlement thereof shares of stock valued at P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> without protest or reservation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The herein private respondent has not been
paid <span style="">a </span>single centavo on its
claim, which was kept pending for more than seven years for alleged lack of
supporting papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the
validity of that claim was not questioned by the petitioner when it sought to
restrain the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage by the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner limited
itself to the argument that the private respondent was <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from questioning the decree because of its earlier compliance with its
provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of these observations, there <span style="">is </span>the consideration that an affront
to the Constitution cannot be allowed to continue existing simply because of
procedural inhibitions that exalt form over substance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is especially disturbed by Section 4(1) of the decree,
quoted above, extinguishing all mortgages and other liens attaching to the
assets <span style="">of </span>AGRIX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also notes, with equal concern, the
restriction in Subsection (ii) thereof that all "unsecured obligations
shall not bear interest" and in Subsection (iii) that "all accrued
interests, penalties or charges as of date hereof pertaining to the
obligations, whether secured or unsecured, shall not be recognized."</p>

<p class="BODY">These provisions must be read with the Bill of Rights, where it
is clearly provided in Section 1 that "no person shall be deprived of
life, liberty or property without due course of law nor shall any person be
denied the equal protection of the law" and in Section 10 that "no
law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed."</p>

<p class="BODY">In defending the decree, the petitioners argue that property
rights, like all rights, are subject to regulation under the police power for
the promotion of the common welfare.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contention is that this inherent power of the state may be exercised at any
time for this purpose so long as the taking of the property right, even if
based on contract, is done with due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is an over-simplification of the problem before
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police power is not a panacea
for all constitutional maladies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
does its mere invocation conjure an instant and automatic justification for
every act of the government depriving a person of his life, liberty or
property.</p>

<p class="BODY">A legislative act based on the police power requires the
concurrence of a lawful subject and a lawful method.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In more familiar words, a) the interests of
the public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular class, should
justify the interference of the state; and b) the means employed are reasonably
necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not unduly oppressive upon
individuals.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying these criteria to the case at bar, the Court finds first
of all that the interests of the public are not sufficiently involved to
warrant the interference of the government with the private contracts of
AGRIX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree speaks vaguely of the
"public, particularly the small investors," who would be prejudiced
if the corporation were not to be assisted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the record does not state how many there are of such investors,
and who they are, and why they are being preferred to the private respondent
and other creditors of AGRIX with vested property rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public interest supposedly involved is not identified or
explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not been shown that by
the of creation of the New <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>, Inc. and the
extinction of the property rights of the creditors of AGRIX, the interests of
the public as a whole, as distinguished from those of a particular class, <span style="">would </span>be promoted or protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">indispensable
link to the welfare of the greater number </span><span style="">has </span><span style="">not been
established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it would
appear that the decree was issued only to favor </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">special group of
investors who, for reasons not given, have been preferred </span>to the
legitimate creditors of AGRIX.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <span style="">there is </span>a
<span style="">valid public interest involved, </span>the
Court <span style="">still finds that the means
employed to rehabilitate AGRIX fall far short of the requirement that </span>they
shall not be unduly oppressive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
oppressiveness <span style="">is </span>patent on the
face of the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right to property
in all mortgages, liens, interests, penalties and charges owing to the
creditors of AGRIX is arbitrarily destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No consideration is paid for the extinction of the <span style="">mortgage rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accrued interests and other charges are </span><span style="">simply </span><span style="">rejected by the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
right to property is dissolved by legislative fiat </span>without regard <span style="">to the private interest violated and, worse,
in favor of another </span>private <span style="">interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A mortgage lien </span>is
<span style="">a property right </span>derived from
contract and so comes under the protection of the Bill of Rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">So do interests on loans,
as well as penalties and charges, which are also vested rights once they
accrue.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private property c<span style="">annot </span>simply be taken by law from one
person and given to another without compensation and any known public
purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is plain arbitrariness and
is not permitted under the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">And not only <span style="">is </span>there
arbitrary taking, <span style="">there is
discrimination as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In extinguishing
the mortgage and </span>other liens, the decree lumps the secured creditors
with the unsecured creditors and places them on the same level in the
prosecution of their respective claims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this respect, all of them are considered unsecured creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only concession given to the secured
creditors is that their loans are allowed to earn interest from the date of the
decree, but that still does not justify the cancellation of the interests
earned before that date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such interests,
whether due to the secured or the unsecured creditors, are all extinguished by
the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming such
cancellation to be valid, we still cannot <span style="">see
</span>why all kinds of creditors, regardless of security, are treated alike.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the equal protection clause, all persons or things
similarly situated must be treated alike, both in the privileges conferred and
the obligations imposed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, all
persons or things differently situated should be treated differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, persons <u><span style="">differently</span></u><span style=""> </span>situated are <u><span style="">similarly</span></u><span style=""> </span>treated, in disregard of the
principle that there should be equality only among equals.</p>

<p class="BODY">One may also well wonder why AGRIX was singled out for government
help, among other corporations where the stockholders or investors were also
swindled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not clear why other
companies entitled to similar concern were not similarly treated. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>And surely, the stockholders of the private
respondent, whose mortgage lien had been canceled and legitimate claims to
accrued interests rejected, were no less deserving of protection, which they
did not get.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decree operated, to use
the words of a celebrated case,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"with an evil eye and an uneven hand."</p>

<p class="BODY">On top of all this, New <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>, Inc. was
created by special decree notwithstanding the provision of Article XIV, Section
4 of the 1973 Constitution, then in force, that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
shall not, except by general law, provide for the formation, organization, or
regulation of private corporations, unless such corporations are <span style="">owned or controlled by the Government or any
subdivision or instrumentality thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The new corporation is neither owned nor controlled by the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Development
Corporation was merely required to extend a loan of not more than P10<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> to New <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending payment thereof, NDC would
undertake the management of the corporation, but with the obligation of making
periodic reports to the <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span> board of
directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After payment of the loan,
the said board can then appoint its own management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stocks of the new corporation are to be
issued to the old investors and stockholders of AGRIX upon proof of their
claims against the abolished corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They <span style="">shall </span>then be the
owners of the new corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>New <span class="SpellE">Agrix</span>, Inc. is entirely private and so should have been
organized under the Corporation Law in accordance with the above-cited
constitutional provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court also feels that the decree impairs the obligation <span style="">of </span>the contract between AGRIX and the
private respondent without justification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that the police power is superior to the impairment
clause, the principle will apply only where the contract is so related to the
public welfare that it will be considered congenitally susceptible to change by
the legislature in the interest of the greater number.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Most present-day contracts are of that nature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But as already observed, the contracts of loan and mortgage executed by
AGRIX are purely private transactions and have not been shown to be affected
with public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
therefore <span style="">no </span>warrant to amend
their provisions and deprive the private respondent of its vested property
rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that only recently in the case of the
Development Bank of the Philippines v. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
we sustained the preference in payment of a mortgage creditor as against the
argument that the claims of laborers should take precedence over all other
claims, including those of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In arriving at this ruling, the Court recognized the mortgage lien as a
property right protected by the due process <span style="">and </span>contract clauses notwithstanding the argument that the
amendment in Section 110 of the Labor Code was a proper exercise of the police
power.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court reaffirms and applies that ruling in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our finding, in sum, is that Pres. Decree No. 1717 is an invalid <span style="">exercise </span>of the police power, not being
in conformity with the traditional requirements of a lawful subject and <span style="">a </span>lawful method.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The extinction of the mortgage and other
liens and of the interest and other charges pertaining to the legitimate
creditors of AGRIX constitutes taking without due process of law, and this is
compounded by the reduction of the secured creditors to the category of
unsecured creditors in violation of the equal protection clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the new corporation, being neither
owned nor controlled by the Government, should have been created only by
general and not special law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And insofar
as the decree also interferes with purely private agreements without any
demonstrated connection with the public interest, there is likewise an
impairment of the obligation of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the above pronouncements, we feel there is no more need to
rule on the authority of President Marcos to promulgate Pres. Decree No. 1717
under Amendment No. 6 of the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even if he had such authority, the decree must fall just the <span style="">same </span>because of its violation of the
Bill of Rights.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pres. Decree No. 1717 is declared
