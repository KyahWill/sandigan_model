Clerk of Court, <span class="GramE">Branch</span> XI to explain in writing within
three days from receipt why no disciplinary action should be taken against him
for withholding for almost four (4) months Criminal Case No. 159489-SA.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his letter dated July 2, 1981 Atty. Barrozo alleged that
Deputy Clerk of Court Ernesto Biscarra of Branch XI (night court) is in-charge
of, and responsi­ble for, the docketing of all special arrest cases filed with
the court and, as such, he was in possession of the docket stamp machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Barrozo disclaimed knowledge of how the
case in question was docketed.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon being required to explain, Deputy Clerk of Court Ernesto
Biscarra stated that in the late after­noon of February 13, 1981, he received
from the Special Docket Division (night court) twenty (20) new informa­tions
from the City Fiscal's Office, which he entered and numbered from Criminal Case
No. 159469-SA to Criminal Case No. 159488 and that he did not place the number
on the subject case but suspected that it must have been done by somebody when
he was attending to his duties as Branch Clerk of Court at the night court.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his report submitted on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1981</st1:date>, Judge Paredes made the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing evidence, the under­signed finds Biscarra
is in charge of the docketing of all special arrest (SA) cases in the Night
Court (Branch XI).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he has custody
and possession of the docket stamping machine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since he claims that somebody had 'unlawfully' numbered Ramon Lulu's
information as Criminal Case No. 159589-SA (See Annex "B",
Naciongayo's comment) while he was on trial duty after 5:15 p.m. the rea­sonable
conclusion is that Biscarra did not keep the stamping machine well and had not
safely guarded it from unauthorized used by other court employees or even
outsiders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is a clear case of
neglect of duty on his part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Barrozo cannot simply disclaim any res­ponsibility regarding
the safekeeping and mis­use of the docket stamping machine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being the branch clerk of court he is
supposed to have supervision and control over the employees under him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thus shares the negligence of Biscarra,
his deputy clerk under the doctrine of command responsibility or for failure to
see to it that Biscarra properly and diligently discharged his duty or to help
him do it if his deputy was truly busy at the trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On April 27, 1981, in Administrative Matter No. p-2457 before
the Honorable Supreme Court, entitled "Judge Antonio P. Paredes, Executive
Judge of the City Court of Manila, complainant, versus Atilano Barrozo, Branch
Clerk of Court, respondent", therein respondent was found guilty of
inexcusable neglect for delaying for six days in the transmitting of a case to
the Executive Judge for raffling and ordered to pay a fine equivalent to his
compen­sation for twenty (20) days, with warning against a repetition of
another irregularity which penalty on June 17, 1981 was subsequently reduced to
a fine equivalent to five (5) days salary."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
