April 10, 1981 and April 20, 1981 insofar as the same declare petitioner guilty

suspending petitioner from the practice of law for the acts and omissions for

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, a member of the Philippine Bar and a legal officer in

the complaining witness in Criminal Cases Nos. CU-4457 and CU-4458 for falsification

the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> presided by
respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 24, 1980, the accused <span class="SpellE">Consolador</span>
Lao, private respondent herein, filed a motion to have petitioner declared in
contempt of court for having allegedly (1) obtained the postponement of the
hearing of the two cases scheduled on August 27 and 28, 1979 on the false claim
that his father had died; 2) testified falsely on October 6, 1980 that he was
not at a time connected with any government office and that he was a practicing
lawyer; and (3) executed an affidavit imputing derogatory conduct to the lower
court, thus placing it in discredit and subjecting it to disrespect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

petitioner appeared before respondent court and reiterated his plea for time to
file his explanation and for the resetting of the hearing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was given up to February 6, 1981
to submit his explanation, whereupon he manifested that he was not taking the

on this <span class="GramE">date,</span> the hearing was reset to <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1981</st1:date> and petitioner was

prosecute Criminal Cases Nos. CU-4457 and CU-4458, manifested that petitioner
had instructed him to tell the court that he was submitting the incident for
resolution. The court accordingly required <span class="SpellE">movant</span> to
present evidence in support of the contempt charge, after which it set one more
hearing thereof on March 23, 1981, to give petitioner a chance to cross-examine
the witnesses or otherwise meet the evidence against him if he so desired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, for his failure to appear on
said hearing of <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1981</st1:date>
and to explain his non-appearance at the previous hearing of <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1981</st1:date>, petitioner was
declared in contempt of court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

observe truthfulness and candor with this Court with respect to the ground
relied upon by him for his motion to reset the hearing of February 27, 1981 and
his justification for his non-appearance on said dates; b) of direct contempt

Collector of Customs of <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>

allegedly to give petitioner a chance to present evidence other than those

a doubt as to whether a contemnor has been guilty of direct or constructive contempt

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the alleged falsity of the document and the

from his official trip to <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> <span class="GramE">was</span>
based solely on the findings of respondent judge as stated in his questioned
order, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As regards his non-appearance before this Court on March 12,
1981, Atty. Santos gives the impression to this Court that he came to know of
the order of February 27, 1981, resetting the hearing of the pending incidents
to March 12, 1981, only upon his return to his residence in Metro Manila from <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, to which he had <span class="SpellE">travelled</span>
officially, appearing before the office of the Collector of Customs of that
place from March 9 to 13, 1981, per Annex 'A' to his explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This claim, however, of<i> </i>Atty. Santos
appears belied by the manifestation of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Gabiana</span>
on March 12, 1981, to the effect that ‘the other day, the complaining witness
in this case, Atty. Jose S. Santos, passed by <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> on
his way to <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> and he was already aware of the
hearing for today because not only (by) informing him of the resetting of this
case today but also by a long distance telephone made by him, that was I think
last Monday, wherein in our conversation I also informed him of the resetting
for today's hearing of his Motion and according to him Your Honor please, he is
submitting this case for resolution of this court.’ <span class="GramE">(TSN-<span class="SpellE">Ermita</span>, 12 March 1981, pp. 2-3).</span> This manifestation
of Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Gabiana</span> appears to be supported by the
evidence and even by the admission of Atty. Santos that he was in fact here in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1981" day="11" month="3">March 11, 1981</st1:date>, the day before the scheduled hearing.</blockquote>

he was in <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, from <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="3">March 9 to 13, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The indubitable proof presented to this

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid findings of respondent judge necessarily require
that petitioner be granted the opportunity to meet said charges against him and
to be heard in his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although we
agree with respondent judge that such acts are contumacious, nevertheless the
same cannot be summarily punished with abuse of discretion and without due
process of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if the surmises of
respondent judge are correct, the acts attributed to petitioner would at most
be constitutive of indirect contempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Direct contempt presupposes that the misbehavior was committed in order
to interrupt the administration of justice or with disrespect to the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A court, as a rule, has the power to punish perjury as <span class="GramE">a contempt</span> even though perjury is an indictable offense,
where the circumstances are such that the perjury obstructs the administration
of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, criminal contempt
proceedings are not available as a substitute for a perjury prosecution, and
that, inasmuch as perjury is a crime, it should not be punished as <span class="GramE">a contempt</span> unless exceptional circumstances exist and the
administration of justice is obstructed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The charge that petitioner executed an affidavit imputing
derogatory conduct to the court is not supported by the evidence on
record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A cursory reading of the
affidavit itself negates the findings of respondent judge that it gives the
impression that he is approachable and willing to enter into an arrangement for
the benefit of one party to the prejudice of the adverse party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Annexed to petitioner's motion for
reconsideration filed in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for relief from the

said affidavit narrates petitioner's request made to respondent judge in
chambers for the latter's possible inhibition, and that the latter supposedly
agreed but thereafter changed his mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is actually an explanation for petitioner's failure to testify
coupled with, at the most, an expression of misgivings on his part over the
denial by respondent judge of his motion for inhibition and the subsequent
dismissal of the criminal cases wherein petitioner was the complaining
witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said affidavit neither contains
any derogatory statement nor uses disrespectful or contemptuous language.</p>

inherent power in order to retain that respect without which the administration
