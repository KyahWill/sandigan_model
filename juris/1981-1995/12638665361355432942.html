				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Curiously, this is a case of life imitating fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The story of the rascal son of the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hacendero</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>forcing his attentions on the
helpless maidservant is an oft-told drama that has become virtually part of our
folklore and a favorite staple of our local movies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court has found that the facts
conformed substantially to the familiar plot and pronounced the
accused-appellant guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span>, Jr. has a different
tale to tell.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant was at the time of the alleged offense 26
years old and the overseer in his father's <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

his defense counsel), he finished only Grade VI, after having been enrolled by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">parents in a succession of no less than six</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>schools <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> and Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also facing charges </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The complainant is <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Abaring</span>, a 21-year old
employee in the <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span> poultry farm and residing in
the <span class="SpellE"><u>hacendero's</u></span> compound.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her sister <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span>

together with the other female help sleep in the house of their employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their parents are distantly related to the <span class="SpellE">Japitanas</span> and also work for the latter in their <u>hacienda</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Japitana</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> was charged with having raped <span class="SpellE">Abaring</span> on May 16, 1970, in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The offense was allegedly committed
in a small bodega or stockroom in the <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span>
compound at about ten o'clock in the morning of that date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was inside the stockroom when <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
entered and suddenly <span class="SpellE">headlocked</span> her with his left arm
while covering her mouth with his right hand to prevent her from crying
out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The girl's reaction was to resist,
and the two fell on the cement floor, where they continued grappling, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> all the while urging her to give in and assuring her
that he would marry her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> scratched his face and he bit her hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they struggled, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
kicked him in the neck and <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> pulled off her shorts
and panty, tearing both of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shed
off his trousers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
screamed as he tried to pry her thighs apart and, finally succeeding as the
girl's resistance weakened, plunged </span>his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

repeatedly intruded his manhood, </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The police came to investigate and retrieved <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> shorts </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was later taken to the police station,
where she formally filed her complaint and was examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span>, medico-legal
officer of the <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> Police Department.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The defense </span>had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an entirely different version of the </span>incident,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
as a </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">femme</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <u>fatale</u> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> as a pliant </span>victim who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had succumbed to </span>her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">temptation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the morning </span>in question, according to him, he had just entered
the stockroom after briefly talking to three persons who were working outside
when <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> followed him, closing the door behind
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without much ado, she took him in
her arms and started fondling his penis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Reacting, he caressed her crotch and sought to remove her shorts but
found that the zipper was broken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
moved his hand aside and took them off herself, along with her panty, and with
her right arm around this neck, drew him down on the cement floor with
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lying on his left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">side </span>with his right leg upon her right
leg, he then inserted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">his </span>right
index and middle fingers in her vagina, moving them in simulation of coition as
she writhed in ecstasy for five to ten minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said he could not unzip his tight-fitting pants and as his groin was
pressing upon his shorts he had an orgasm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was at this point that Gloria suddenly appeared at the window and
shouted, "Hey, what are you doing there?"</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pio</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> described <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
as a woman of loose morals who had insinuated herself on him, often calling him
handsome and brushing her breasts against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She also flirted with the male helpers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He made much of the open window in the stockroom through which he said
she could have escaped </span>if she really wanted to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also stressed that he would not have
attempted to rape her at that time because of the three workers outside who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">were </span>only four meters away and could
have heard her screams.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Among
these workers was Romeo <span class="SpellE">Apitana</span>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">who </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">testified that he was indeed outside with the two other </span>workers
at the time in question and saw <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> follow <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> into the stockroom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He said what they were doing inside was none of his business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He added that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
came out later after <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> and Gloria had opened the
door, and she was screaming and in tears; later in the house, she shouted,
"You fool, you will have your day!"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Examining himself on the stand, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Japitana</span>, Sr. testified that he was in his office at
the time in question but did not hear <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
screaming although the stockroom was only fifteen meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he questioned <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
that morning, she said his son did not have sexual intercourse with her but
merely inserted his fingers in her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This witness also declared that what he said that morning was that he
would investigate the matter and if the charges were true, his son "must
suffer the consequences." Of particular interest was his assertion that
someone in the police department who claimed he was close to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span> but did not identify himself called him up and
suggested that the medical report could be "doctored" for a
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said he indignantly
rejected the offer.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are also charges and counter-charges of overtures for the
settlement of the case, but these are at best peripheral issues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What matters is the really relevant evidence
submitted by the parties which the Court has carefully considered and evaluated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis thereof, we are convinced that
the lower court committed no reversible error in its excellent decision, which
is a model of clarity and perceptiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly stressed that, absent any indication to the
contrary, this Court will accord the highest respect to the findings of the
trial judge, who had the opportunity to watch the witnesses on the stand and to
determine by their deportment if they were speaking the truth or lying in their
teeth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding no such indications here,
we agree with the observations of then Judge Oscar R. <span class="SpellE">Victoriano</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(later Presiding </span>Justice of the
Court of Appeals) that ?</p>

<blockquote>Subjected to diligent and painstaking scrutiny, the testimony of
the offended girl, given in <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>straightforward
manner, neither wavering nor fumbling, unimpaired by material discrepancies and
contradictions and shown to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>be
consistent with ordinary human experience, undoubtedly bears the imprint of
truth and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>therefore must be
accepted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is not difficult to believe that <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>
could have easily overpowered <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>, given his
physical build, not to mention his moral influence as the son of his victim's
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also perfectly natural
for <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> to rush out of the stockroom after her
violation and to complain to the mother, not the father, of the man who had
raped her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Women share their problems
with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is no less
noteworthy that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> acted decisively after the
outrage, reporting it immediately to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mrs.
</span><span class="SpellE">Japitana</span> and then to the police, 'to the extent
of even forgetting to put on her shorts and panty, which the police found later
in the bodega.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, when she was
examined that same afternoon by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span>, she was
still stinking from the chicken mash that stuck to her body and hair while she
was wrestling with <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> on the cement floor of the
stockroom.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the most telling proof that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
was not lying is the medical report,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which confirmed practically every detail of her defloration as she narrated
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said report is reproduced in
full hereunder:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Microscopical</span> examination:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cervical <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<blockquote>Physical injuries:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1)
Contusion with abrasion, mucosa, lower lip, left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) Abrasion linear,
2 in number at lateral aspect, neck, right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) Punctuated
superficial lacerated wounds, at the posterior aspect, index, middle and ring
finger, hand, right.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) Abrasion, knee,
left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Duration:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>5-7 days if properly treated and if without
due complications.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court noted:</p>

<blockquote>Before the certificate was issued, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span>
observed the complainant to be pale and nervous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her dress was dirty and her hair <span class="SpellE">dishevelled</span> with some sandy substance smelling of poultry
feed on her hair and body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated
that the contusion on the left lower lip on the mucosa (lower lip, left) could
have been caused by a fall, and the abrasion thereon could be due to friction
against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>rough
surface such as a struggle on a cement surface.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The two (2) linear abrasions at the lateral aspect of the right neck
could have been due to a pointed object like finger nails, while the punctuated
superficial lacerated wounds at the posterior aspect of the index, middle and
ring fingers of the right hand could have been caused by sharp objects like
teeth bite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He attributed the abrasion
at the upper angle of the labia <span class="SpellE">majoria</span> and <span class="SpellE">minora</span> which were slightly gaping to friction against a
rough surface.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The abrasion with
reddening of the vaginal canal could have been caused by a hard elongated
object such as an erect penis in sexual intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He concluded that on the basis of the
lacerations on the hymen, abrasion and <span class="SpellE">reddenning</span> of
the vaginal canal and the result of the microscopic examination which was
positive for sperms the offended party was exposed to recent sexual penetration
with ejaculation at least within twelve (12) hours from the time of the
examination; that based on the genital findings showing lack of proper
stimulation and lubrication of the vaginal canal the offended party was not
sufficiently prepared for intercourse and that in relation to the other
physical findings she offered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">resistance
</span>to the sexual act.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Elaborating on the character of the sexual intercourse in
question, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span> declared:</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could
you inform this Honorable Court the difference if any of the genital organ of a
woman who had just sexual intercourse<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>through
force and violence and that with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a woman
</span>who had just sexual intercourse with her consent if there is any
difference?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
woman who had sexual intercourse through force or violence there is no romance,
sensation, no petting, no orgasm, no stimulation; whereas, a woman doing this
with consent of course they perform the act there is the so-called
preliminaries, romance, which would produce secretions along the vaginal canal
which would diminish the friction, therefore, there is the presence of liquid
and diminish the injury on the vaginal canal; the labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span>
are not so damaged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
examining <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Abaring</span>
and with your findings particularly on the genital examination, what is your
opinion on the character of the sexual intercourse she had.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would say that the woman at that time was not properly prepared; there was no
lubrication; no secretion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
other words doctor, would you say that there was no consent on the part of the
woman considering your findings?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
I could say that woman is not prepared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">By contrast, the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>evidence
of the defense, particularly the testimony of the accused-appellant himself, is
on the whole undeserving of credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it looks <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>be
pure concoction except possibly for the protestations of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span> that he did not hear <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span>

unaware of the girl's cries for help, the fact is that they <u>were</u> heard
by Gloria Baron when she went out into the balcony to tell Atty. <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span> that there was a telephone call for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, it would not have occurred to her

inside is not acceptable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> would not have entered the stockroom, and with
seduction in mind, when there were people nearby who would be wondering what
she and <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> were doing inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his motives would not be free from </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">suspicion, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">considering that he was a first cousin of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>,
Jr. and an employee of <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>, Sr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to his suggestion that there was a window
in the stockroom through which <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> could have
escaped, the girl had <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>quite
logical answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides the fact that
there were feed boxes that obstructed access to the window, there was the
insistent <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> himself who was determined to prevent
her from leaving so he could rape her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Atty. <span class="SpellE">Japitana'a</span>
assertion that somebody tried to extort money from him in exchange for a
medical examination report favorable to his son was just that - a mere
assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No evidence was adduced to
support it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a </span>lawyer, he
should have known better than to make irresponsible accusations like that,
especially against an accredited medico-legal officer of the government with
recognized credentials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he had really
received such an offer, what he should have done was call for an investigation
to ferret out the guilty party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew
that was his duty as an officer of the court but, by his own <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">admission, he did nothing.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He made<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>another strange
suggestion during the cross-examination of <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>,
when he asked the following question and received an answer he did not see fit
to pursue, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the course of time that Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span> was examining your private part, did you ever notice
whether he undressed during his examination?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
should he undress himself?<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">But apparently not daunted by that
reaction, he later <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">made </span>following
accusation in the accused-appellant's brief:</p>

<blockquote>The fact that the complainant was examined twice can it be
possible, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">first </span>examination, she was used by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lavada</span>, which attributed in the presence of the sperms <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in </span>her private part?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is not only a desperate ploy:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>this is an uncalled for and vicious
imputation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the Court understands
the special zeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Atty. </span><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span>, Sr. had to exert in
defense of his son, such anxiety did not give him a license to make malicious
charges based only on speculation and not solid evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">But more than anything else, it is the testimony of the
accused-appellant himself that has condemned him as a rapist and a liar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His defense is a futile fabrication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By his own account, this 26-year old man said
he used only his fingers to gratify <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> desire
when he could easily have mounted the girl who was ready and aching to be
taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that sperm was found
in <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> vagina, the accused-appellant is in
effect declaring <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">under </span>oath -
that by some sexual miracle, it was his fingers that ejaculated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here was a woman burning with desire and
waiting to be transported by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span>manhood,
and her virile and young lover could only offer her his fingers, unable to
impale her with his phallus because his pants were tight.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">There </span>are limits
to one's credibility and they have been clearly exceeded in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> is plainly
unbelievable even as a teller of tales, much less as a defendant fighting for
his liberty and honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pio's</span> testimony is an affront to truth and our
intelligence; the Court is not as naive as the defense would hope it to be<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>nor is it that gullible.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>hard to
understand the purpose of the defense in showing that the accused-appellant had
studied in all of six schools but reached only Grade VI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it was to prove moral character, then the
evidence has failed to help him; if at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">all,
</span>it has suggested a weakness in his character that lends more credence to
the cause of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged inconsistencies in the testimony of the complaining
witness are merely minor lapses that do not impair the essential <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">veracity of her narration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>To argue that she could have made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">more spirited resistance, </span>as by using the bottles in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the stockroom </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">defend herself, </span>is to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assume that she had full freedom of movement
when in fact she had been seized </span>by her neck, thrown to the floor where,
despite her efforts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>free
herself, she was finally overpowered and defiled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for the other arguments of the defense,
the same are not convincing enough or substantial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">enough to tilt the balance in favor of the accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion, like that of the trial court, is that there is
enough evidence against the accused-appellant to overcome the constitutional
presumption of innocence in his favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">We </span>have absolutely no doubt that in the
morning <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of May 16, 1970, <span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Japitana</span>, Jr. forced <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Abaring</span> to submit to his
will and despite her vigorous defense of her chastity, ruthlessly bloodied her
in a frenzy of animal lust that deprived her of a virginity it was not his
right to pierce.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>the
challenged decision finding the accused-appellant guilty of rape and sentencing
him to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is AFFIRMED except </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
