				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in this petition is the constitutionality of the veto
by the President of certain provisions in the General Appropriations Act for
the Fiscal Year 1992 relating to the payment of the adjusted pensions of
retired Justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are retired Justices of the Supreme Court and
Court of Appeals who are currently receiving monthly pensions under Republic Act
No. 910 as amended by Republic Act No. 1797.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They filed the instant petition on their own behalf and in
representation of all other retired Justices of the Supreme Court and the Court
of Appeals similarly situated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Named respondents are Hon. Franklin <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>
the Executive Secretary, Hon. Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Carague</span> as
Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, and Hon. Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Cajucom</span>, the Treasurer of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents are sued in their official
capacities, being officials of the Executive Department involved in the
implementation of the release of funds appropriated in the Annual
Appropriations Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We treat the Comments of the Office of the Solicitor General
(OSG) as an Answer and decide the petition on its merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual backdrop of this case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1953, Republic Act No. 910 was enacted to provide the
retirement pensions of Justices of the Supreme Court and of the Court of
Appeals who have rendered at least twenty (20) years service either in the
Judiciary or in any other branch of the Government or in both, having attained
the age of seventy (70) years or who resign by reason of incapacity to
discharge the duties of the office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
retired Justice shall receive during the residue of his natural life the salary
which he was receiving at the time of his retirement or resignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 910 was amended by Republic Act No. 1797
(approved on <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1957</st1:date>)
which provided that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3-A In case the salary of Justices of the Supreme Court
or of the Court of Appeals is increased or decreased, such increased or
decreased salary shall, for purposes of this Act, be deemed to be the salary or
the retirement pension which a Justice who as of June twelve, nineteen hundred
fifty-four had ceased to be such to accept another position in the Government
or who retired was receiving at the time of his cessation in office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, that any benefits that have already
accrued prior to such increase or decrease shall not be affected thereby".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Identical retirement benefits were also given to the members of
the Constitutional Commissions under Republic Act No. 1568, as amended by
Republic Act No. 3595.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1974</st1:date>, on the occasion
of the Armed Forces Loyalty Day, President Marcos signed Presidential Decree
578 which extended similar retirement benefits to the members of the Armed
Forces giving them also the automatic readjustment features of Republic Act No.
1797 and Republic Act No. 3595.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two months later, however President Marcos issued Presidential
Decree 644 on January 25, 1975 repealing Section 3-A of Republic Act No. 1797
and Republic Act No. 3595 (amending Republic Act No. 1568 and Presidential
Decree No. 578) which authorized the adjustment of the pension of the retired
Justices of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Chairman and members of the
Constitutional Commissions and the officers and enlisted members of the Armed
Forces to the prevailing rates of salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, under Presidential Decree 1638 the automatic
readjustment of the retirement pension of officers and enlisted men was
subsequently restored by President Marcos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A later decree Presidential Decree 1909 was also issued providing for
the automatic readjustment of the pensions of members of the Armed Forces who
have retired prior to <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="9">September 10,
 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the adjustment of the retirement pensions for members of
the Armed Forces who number in the tens of thousands was restored, that of the
retired Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals who are only a
handful and fairly advanced in years, was not.</p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing the unfairness of the discrimination against the
members of the Judiciary and the Constitutional Commissions, Congress approved
in 1990 a bill for the reenactment of the repealed provisions of Republic Act
No. 1797 and Republic Act No. 3595.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Congress was under the impression that Presidential Decree 644 became
law after it was published in the Official Gazette on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the explanatory note of House Bill No. 16297 and Senate Bill No. 740,
the legislature saw the need to reenact Republic Act Nos. 1797 and 3595 to
restore said retirement pensions and privileges of the retired Justices and
members of the Constitutional Commissions in order to assure those serving in
the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals and Constitutional Commissions adequate old
age pensions even during the time when the purchasing power of the peso has
been diminished substantially by worldwide recession or inflation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is underscored by the fact that the petitioner
retired Chief Justice, a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court and the
retired Presiding Justice are presently receiving monthly pensions of
P3,333.33, P2,666.66 and P2,333.33 respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">President <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Aquino</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> however vetoed House Bill No. 16297 on <st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1990</st1:date> on the ground that
according to her "it would erode the very foundation of the Government's
collective effort to adhere faithfully to and enforce strictly the policy on
standardization of compensation as articulated in Republic Act No. 6758 known
as Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989." She further said
that "the Government should not grant distinct privileges to select group
of officials whose retirement benefits under existing laws already enjoy
preferential treatment over those of the vast majority of our civil service
servants".</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to the instant petition, however, Retired Court of Appeals
Justices Manuel P. Barcelona, Juan P. Enriquez, Juan O. Reyes, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Guardson</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Lood</span> filed a
letter/petition dated <st1:date year="1991" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1991</st1:date>
which we treated as Administrative Matter No. 91-8-225-CA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners asked this Court for a
readjustment of their monthly pensions in accordance with Republic Act No.
1797.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reasoned out that Presidential
Decree 644 repealing Republic Act No. 1797 did not become law as there was no
valid publication pursuant to <span class="SpellE"><u>Ta√±ada</u></span> <u>v.</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>Tuvera</u></span>, (136 SCRA 27 [1985] and 146 SCRA 446
[1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Presidential Decree 644
promulgated on <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="1">January 24, 1975</st1:date>
appeared for the first time only in the supplemental issue of the Official <span class="GramE">Gazette,</span> (Vol. 74 No. 14) purportedly dated <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1977</st1:date> but published only on <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since Presidential Decree 644 has no binding
force and effect of law, it therefore did not repeal Republic Act No. 1797.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1991" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1991</st1:date> the Court acted favorably on the request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the requests of retired Justices Manuel P.
Barcelona, Juan P. Enriquez, Juan O. Reyes and <span class="SpellE">Guardson</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lood</span> are GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is hereby AUTHORIZED that their monthly pensions be adjusted and paid
on the basis of RA 1797 effective <st1:date year="1991" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1991</st1:date> without prejudice to the payment of their pension
differentials corresponding to the previous years upon the availability of
funds for the purpose."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant<span style="">&nbsp; </span> to the above
resolution, Congress included in the General Appropriations Bill for Fiscal
Year 1992 certain appropriations for the Judiciary intended for the payment of
the adjusted pension rates due the retired Justices of the Supreme Court and
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions in House Bill No. 34925 are as follows:</p>

"the resolution of this Honorable Court in Administrative Matter No.

effectively nullified the veto of the President of House Bill No. 16297, the

Constitutional Commissions by re-enacting Republic Act No. 1797 and Republic

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Raising similar grounds, the petitioners
in AM-91-8-225-CA, brought to the attention of this Court that the veto
constitutes no legal obstacle to the continued payment of the adjusted pensions
pursuant to the Court's resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1992" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1992</st1:date>,
the Court resolved to consolidate Administrative Matter No. 91-8-225-CA with
G.R. No. 103524.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' contentions are well-taken.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot be overstressed that in a constitutional government
such as ours, the rule of law must prevail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution is the basic and paramount law to which all other laws must
conform and to which all persons, including the highest official of this land,
must defer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this cardinal
postulate, it follows that the three branches of government must discharge
their respective functions within the limits of authority conferred by the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the principle of
separation of powers, <span class="GramE">neither Congress, the President, nor
the Judiciary</span> may encroach on fields allocated to the other branches of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislature is generally
limited to the enactment of laws, the executive to the enforcement of laws and
the judiciary to their interpretation and application to cases and
controversies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution expressly confers on the judiciary the power to
maintain inviolate what it decrees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
the guardian of the Constitution we cannot shirk the duty of seeing to it that
the officers in each branch of government do not go beyond their
constitutionally allocated boundaries and that the entire Government itself or
any of its branches does not violate the basic liberties of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The essence of this judicial duty was
emphatically explained by Justice Laurel in the leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Angara</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Electoral</u> <u>Commission</u>,
(63 Phil. 139 [1936]) to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The Constitution is a definition of the powers of
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is to determine the
nature, scope and extent of such powers?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the
judiciary as the rational way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And <u>when</u>
<u>the</u> <u>judiciary</u> <u>mediates</u> <u>to</u> <u>allocate</u> <u>constitutional</u>
<u>boundaries,</u> <u>it</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>assert</u> <u>any</u> <u>superiority</u>
<u>over</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>department,</u> <u>it</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u>
<u>in</u> <u>reality</u> <u>nullify</u> <u>or</u> <u>invalidate</u> <u>an</u> <u>act</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>legislature,</u> <u>but</u> <u>only</u> <u>asserts</u> <u>the</u>
<u>solemn</u> <u>and</u> <u>sacred</u> <u>obligation</u> <u>assigned</u> <u>to</u>
<u>it</u> <u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Constitution</u> to determine conflicting claims
of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an
actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to
them." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The act of the Executive in vetoing the particular provisions is
an exercise of a constitutionally vested power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But even as the Constitution grants the power, it also provides
limitations to its exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The veto
power is not absolute.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provision of the Constitution reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The President shall have the power to veto any particular
item or items in an appropriation, revenue or tariff bill but the veto shall
not affect the item or items to which he does not object." (Section 27(2),
Article VI, Constitution)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The OSG is correct when it states that the Executive must veto a
bill in its entirety or not at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
or she cannot act like an editor crossing out specific lines, provisions, or
paragraphs in a bill that he or she dislikes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the exercise of the veto power, it is generally all or nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when it comes to appropriation,
revenue or tariff bills, the Administration needs the money to run the
machinery of government and it can not veto the entire bill even if it may
contain objectionable features.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President
is, therefore, compelled to approve into law the entire bill, including its
undesirable parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for this reason
that the Constitution has wisely provided the "item veto power" to
avoid inexpedient riders being attached to an indispensable appropriation or
revenue measure.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution provides that only a particular item or items
may be vetoed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to disapprove
any item or items in an appropriate bill does not grant the authority to veto a
part of an item and to approve the remaining portion of the same item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Gonzales v. <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>,
Jr., 191 SCRA 452, 464 [1990])</p>

<p class="BODY">We distinguish an item from a provision in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>terms <u>item</u>
and <u>provision</u> in budgetary legislation and practice are concededly
different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An <u>item</u> in a bill
refers to the particulars, the details, the distinct and severable parts x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> of the bill (<span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, <u>supra</u>, at 916.) It is an indivisible sum of
money dedicated to a stated purpose (Commonwealth v. Dodson, 11 S.E., 2d 120,
124, 125, etc., 176 <st1:state><st1:place>Va.</st1:place></st1:state>
281).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The United States Supreme Court,
in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Bengzon</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Secretary</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Justice</u> (299 U.S. 410, 414, 57 Ct 252, 81 L. Ed., 312)
declared ‚Äòthat an ‚Äòitem‚Äô of an appropriation bill obviously means an <u>item</u>
which in itself is a specific appropriation of money, not some <u>general</u> <u>provision</u>
<u>of</u> <u>law</u>, which happens to be put into an appropriation
bill.‚Äô" (<span class="GramE">id</span>. at page 465)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We regret having to state that misimpressions or unfortunately
wrong advice must have been the basis of the disputed veto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general fund adjustment is an item which appropriates P500<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> to enable the Government to meet certain
unavoidable obligations which may have been inadequately funded by the specific
items for the different branches, departments, bureaus, agencies, and offices
of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President did not veto this item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What were vetoed were methods or systems
placed by Congress to insure that permanent and continuing obligations to
certain officials would be paid when they fell due.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the entire sections and the underlined portions
of the law which were vetoed will readily show that portions of the item have
been chopped up into vetoed and <span class="SpellE">unvetoed</span> parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Less than all of an item has been
vetoed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the vetoed portions
are not <u>items</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are <u>provisions</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the <u>augmentation</u> of specific appropriations found
inadequate to pay retirement payments, by transferring savings from other items
of appropriation is a provision and not an item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gives power to the Chief Justice to
transfer funds from one item to another.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no specific appropriation of money involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same manner, the provision which states that in compliance
with decisions of the Supreme Court and the Commission on Audit, funds still
undetermined in amount may be drawn from the general fund adjustment is not an
item.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the "general fund
adjustment" itself which is the item.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was not touched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
vetoed.</p>

<p class="BODY">More ironic is the fact that misinformation led the Executive to
believe that the items in the 1992 Appropriations Act were being vetoed when,
in fact, the veto struck something else.</p>

<p class="BODY">What were really vetoed are:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 1797
enacted as early as <st1:date year="1957" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1957</st1:date>;
and</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Resolution of the
Supreme Court dated <st1:date year="1991" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1991</st1:date>
in Administrative Matter No. 91-8-225-CA.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need no lengthy justifications or citations of authorities to
declare that no President may veto the provisions of a law enacted thirty-five
(35) years before his or her term of office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither may the President set aside or reverse a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment of this Court through the exercise of
the veto power.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few background facts may be reiterated to fully explain the
unhappy situation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 1797 provided for the adjustment of pensions of
retired Justices which privilege was extended to retired members of
Constitutional Commissions by Republic Act No. 3595.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1975</st1:date>,
President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 644 which repealed Republic
Acts 1797 and 3595.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
automatic readjustment of pensions for retired Armed Forces officers and men
was surreptitiously restored through Presidential Decree Nos. 1638 and 1909.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was the impression that Presidential Decree No. 644 had
reduced the pensions of Justices and Constitutional Commissioners which led
Congress to restore the repealed provisions through House Bill No. 16297 in
1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her finance and budget
advisers gave the wrong information that the questioned provisions in the 1992
General Appropriations Act were simply an attempt to overcome her earlier 1990
veto, she issued the veto now challenged in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It turns out, however, that P. D. No. 644 never became valid
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If P. D. No. 644 was not law, it
follows that Rep. Act No. 1797 was not repealed and continues to be effective
up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the same way that
it was enforced from 1957 to 1975, so should it be enforced <span class="GramE">today.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">House Bill No. 16297 was superfluous as it tried to restore
benefits which were never taken away validly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The veto of House Bill No. 16297 in 1990 did not also produce any
effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both were based on erroneous and
non-existent premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing discussion, it can be seen that when the
President vetoed certain provisions of the 1992 General Appropriations Act, she
was actually vetoing Republic Act No. 1797 which, of course, is beyond her
power to accomplish.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presidential Decree No. 644 which purportedly repealed Republic
Act No. 1797 never achieved that purpose because it was not properly
published.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It never became a law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Ta√±ada</u></span> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tuvera</u></span> (136 SCRA 27 [1985] and 146 SCRA 446 [1986])
specifically requires that "all laws shall immediately upon their approval
or as soon thereafter as possible, be published in full in the Official
Gazette, to become effective only after fifteen days from their publication, or
on another date specified by the legislature, in accordance with Article 2 of
the Civil Code".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the
Court's answer to the petition of Senator Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Ta√±ada</span>
and other opposition leaders who challenged the validity of Marcos‚Äô decrees
which, while never published, were being enforced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Secret decrees are anathema in a free
society.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of their request, the petitioners in Administrative
Matter No. 91-8-225-CA secured a certification from Director <span class="SpellE">Lucita</span> C. Sanchez of the National Printing Office that the <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="4">April 4<span class="GramE">,1977</span></st1:date>

unworthy motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The independence of
which they are assured is impressed with a significance transcending that of a
purely personal right." (At pp. 338-339)</p>

<p class="BODY">The exercise of the veto power in this case may be traced back to
the efforts of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to ignore or
overlook the plain mandate of the Constitution on fiscal autonomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The OSG Comment reflects the same truncated
view of the provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly in the past few years called the attention of
DBM that not only does it allocate less than one percent (1%) of the national
budget annually for the 22,769 Justices, Judges, and court personnel all over
the country but it also examines with a fine-toothed comb how we spend the
funds appropriated by Congress based on DBM recommendations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The gist of our position papers and arguments before Congress is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The DBM requires the Supreme Court, the Constitutional
Commissions, and the Ombudsman to submit budget proposals in accordance with
parameters it establishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DBM evaluates
the proposals, asks each agency to defend its proposals during DBM budget
hearings, submits its own version of the proposals to Congress without
informing the agency of major alterations and mutilations inflicted on their
proposals, and expects each agency to defend in Congress proposals not of the
agency's making.</blockquote>

<blockquote>After the general appropriations bill is passed by Congress and
signed into law by the President, the tight and officious control by DBM
continues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the release of
appropriated funds, the Judiciary, Constitutional Commissions, and Ombudsman
are instructed through ‚Äòguidelines‚Äô, how to prepare Work and Financial Plans
and requests for monthly allotments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
DBM evaluates and approves these plans and requests and on the basis of its
approval authorizes the release of allotments with corresponding notices of
cash allocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These notices specify
the maximum withdrawals each month which the Supreme Court, the Commissions,
and the Ombudsman may make from the servicing government bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above agencies are also required to
submit to DBM monthly, quarterly, and year-end budget accountability reports to
indicate their performance, physical and financial operations, and income.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The DBM reserves to itself the power to review the accountability
reports and, when importuned for needed funds, to release additional allotments
to the agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since DBM <u>always</u>
prunes the budget proposals to below subsistence levels and since emergency
situations usually occur during the fiscal year, the Chief Justice, Chairmen of
the <span class="GramE">Commissions,</span> and Ombudsman are compelled to make
pilgrimages to DBM for additional funds to tide their respective agencies over
the emergency."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is fiscal autonomy?</p>

<p class="BODY">As envisioned in the Constitution, the fiscal autonomy enjoyed by
the Judiciary, the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Audit, the Commission
on <span class="GramE">Elections,</span> and the Office of the Ombudsman
contemplates a guarantee of full flexibility to allocate and utilize their
resources with the wisdom and dispatch that their needs require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It recognizes the power and authority to levy,
assess and collect fees, fix rates of compensation not exceeding the highest
rates authorized by law for compensation and pay plans of the government and
allocate and disburse such sums as may be provided by law or prescribed by them
in the course of the discharge of their functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fiscal autonomy means freedom from outside control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Supreme Court says it needs 100
typewriters but DBM rules we need only 10 typewriters and sends its
recommendations to Congress without even informing us, the autonomy given by
the Constitution becomes an empty and illusory platitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Judiciary, the Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman
must have the independence and flexibility needed in the discharge of their
constitutional duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imposition of
restrictions and constraints on the manner the independent constitutional
offices allocate and utilize the funds appropriated for their operations is
anathema to fiscal autonomy and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> not only of
the express mandate of the Constitution but especially as regards the Supreme
Court, of the independence and separation of powers upon which the entire
fabric of our constitutional system is based.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the interest of comity and cooperation, the Supreme Court,
Constitutional Commissions, and the Ombudsman have so far limited their
objections to constant reminders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We now
agree with the petitioners that this grant of autonomy should cease to be a
meaningless provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the veto of these specific provisions in the
General Appropriations Act is tantamount to dictating to the Judiciary how its
funds should be utilized, which is clearly repugnant to fiscal autonomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The freedom of the Chief Justice to make
adjustments in the utilization of the funds appropriated for the expenditures
of the judiciary, including the use of any savings from any particular item to
cover deficits or shortages in other items of the judiciary is withheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the Constitutional mandate, the
Judiciary must enjoy freedom in the disposition of the funds allocated to it in
the appropriations law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It knows its
priorities just as it is aware of the fiscal restraints.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chief Justice must be given a free hand
on how to augment appropriations where augmentation is needed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, in the case of <u>Gonzales</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Macaraig</u></span> (191 SCRA 452 [1990]), the Court upheld the
authority of the President and other key officials to augment any item or any
appropriation from savings in the interest of expediency and efficiency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"There should be no question, therefore, that statutory
authority has, in fact, been granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And once given, the heads of the different branches of the Government
and those of the Constitutional Commissions are afforded considerable
flexibility in the use of public funds and resources (<span class="SpellE">Demetria</span>
v. Alba, supra).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of
separation of powers is in no way endangered because the transfer is made
within a department (or branch of government) and not from one department
(branch) to another."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution, particularly Article VI Section 25(5) also
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 25.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(5) No law shall be passed authorizing any
transfer of appropriations; however, the President, the President of the
Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, and the heads of Constitutional Commissions may, by law, be
authorized to augment any item in the general appropriations law for their
respective offices from savings in other items of their respective
appropriations."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the vetoed provisions which relate to the
use of savings for augmenting items for the payment of the pension
differentials, among others, are clearly in consonance with the <span class="SpellE">abovestated</span> pronouncements of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The veto impairs the power of the Chief
Justice to augment other items in the Judiciary's appropriation, in
contravention of the constitutional provision on "fiscal autonomy".</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it can not be denied that the retired Justices have a
vested right to the accrued pensions due them pursuant to RA 1797.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to a public pension is of statutory origin and statutes
dealing with pensions have been enacted by practically all the states in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> (State ex <span class="SpellE">rel</span>.
<st1:city><st1:place>Murray</st1:place></st1:city> v. Riley, 44 <st1:state><st1:place>Del</st1:place></st1:state>
505, 62 A2d 236), and presumably in most countries of the world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Statutory provisions for the support of
Judges or Justices on retirement are founded on services rendered to the
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a judge has complied with
the statutory prerequisite for retirement with pay, his right to retire and
draw salary becomes vested and may not, thereafter, be revoked or
impaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Gay v. Whitehurst 44 So ad
430)</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the Philippines, a number of retirement laws have been
enacted, the purpose of which is to entice competent men and women to enter the
government service and to permit them to retire <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
with relative security, not only those who have retained their vigor but, more
so, those who have been incapacitated by illness or accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In re:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Amount of the Monthly Pension of Judges and Justices Starting From the
Sixth Year of their Retirement and After the Expiration of the Initial
Five-year Period of Retirement, (190 SCRA 315 [1990])</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as 1953, Rep. Act No. 910 was enacted to grant pensions
to retired Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was amended by RA 1797 which provided for an automatic
adjustment of the pension rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through
the years, laws were enacted and jurisprudence expounded to afford retirees
better benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">P. D. No. 1438, for one, was promulgated on June 10, 1978
amending RA 910 providing that the lump sum of 5 years gratuity to which the
retired Justices of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals were entitled was to
be computed on the basis of the highest monthly aggregate of transportation,
living and representation allowances each Justice was receiving on the date of
his resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court in a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1990</st1:date>,
stated that this law on gratuities covers the monthly pensions of retired
Judges and Justices which should include the highest monthly aggregate of
transportation, living and representation allowances the retiree was receiving
on the date of retirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(In Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amount of the Monthly Pension of Judges and
Justices, <u>supra</u>)</p>

<p class="BODY">The rationale behind the veto which implies that Justices and
Constitutional officers are unduly favored is, again, a misimpression.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately, we can state that retired Armed Forces officers and <u>enlisted</u>
<u>men</u> number in the tens of thousands while retired Justices are so few
they can be immediately identified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justices retire at age 70 while military men retire at a much younger
age - some retired Generals left the military at age 50 or earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the benefits in Rep. Act No. 1797 are
made to apply equally to both groups.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Any ideas arising from an alleged violation of the equal protection
clause should first be directed to retirees in the military or civil service
where the reason for the retirement provision is not based on indubitable and
constitutionally sanctioned grounds, not to a handful of retired Justices whose
retirement pensions are founded on constitutional reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions regarding retirement pensions of Justices arise
from the package of protections given by the Constitution to guarantee and
preserve the independence of the Judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution expressly vests the power of judicial review in
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any institution given the
power to declare, in proper cases, that acts of both the President and Congress
are unconstitutional needs a high degree of independence in the exercise of its
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our jurisdiction may not be
reduced by Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither may it be
increased without our advice and concurrence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Justices may not be removed until they reach age 70 except through
impeachment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All courts and court
personnel are under the administrative supervision of the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The President may not appoint any Judge or
Justice unless he or she has been nominated by the Judicial and Bar Council
which, in turn, is under the Supreme Court's supervision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our salaries may not be decreased during our
continuance in office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot be
designated to any agency performing administrative or quasi-judicial
functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are specifically given
fiscal autonomy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judiciary is not
only independent of, but also co-equal and <span class="GramE">coordinate</span>
with the Executive and Legislative Departments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Article VIII and Section 30, Article VI, Constitution)</p>

<p class="BODY">Any argument which seeks to remove special privileges given by
law to former Justices of this Court on the ground that there should be no
"grant of distinct privileges" or "preferential treatment"
to retired Justices ignores these provisions of the Constitution and, in
effect, asks that these Constitutional provisions on special protections for
the Judiciary be repealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The integrity
of our entire constitutional system is premised to a large extent on the
independence of the Judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these
provisions are intended to preserve that independence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So are the laws on retirement benefits of
Justices.</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">One last point.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Office of the Solicitor General argues
that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">xxx</span>
Moreover, by granting these benefits to <u>retired</u> Justices implies that
public funds, raised from taxes on other citizens, will be paid off to select
individuals who are already leading private lives and have ceased performing
public service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said the United States
Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Miller:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>‚ÄòTo</u> <u>lay</u> <u>with</u> <u>one</u> <u>hand</u>

Topeka, 20 Wall 655)‚Äù (Comment, p. 16)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above arguments are not only specious, impolite and
offensive; they certainly are unbecoming of an Office whose top officials are
supposed to be, under their charter, <u>learned</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>law</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chief Justice Cesar <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> and Chief
Justice <span class="SpellE">Querube</span> <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>,
Justices J.B.L. Reyes, Cecilia Munoz Palma, <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Plana</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos, and,
in fact, all retired Justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals may
no longer be in the active service.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still, the Solicitor General and all lawyers under him who represent the
Government before the two courts and whose predecessors themselves appeared
before these retirees, should show some continuing esteem and good manners toward
these Justices who are now in the evening of their years.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>All</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>retirees</u> <u>ask</u> <u>is</u>
<u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>given</u> <u>the</u> <u>benefits</u> <u>granted</u> <u>by</u>

engaging in "robbery" is intemperate, abrasive, and <span class="SpellE">disrepectful</span> more so because the argument is unfounded.</p>

severely deteriorated.</p>

statute authorizing cities and counties to issue bonds for the purpose of
building bridges, waterpower, and other public works to aid private railroads
improve their services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law was
declared void on the ground that the right of a municipality to impose a tax
cannot be used for private interests.</p>

immediate beneficiaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was
"robbery" in 1874 is now called "social justice." There is
nothing about retirement benefits in the cited case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the OSG lawyers cited from an old
textbook or encyclopedia which could not even spell "loan"
correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good lawyers are expected to
go to primary sources and to use only relevant citations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has been deluged with letters and petitions by former
colleagues in the Judiciary requesting adjustments in their pensions <span class="GramE">Just</span> so they would be able to cope with the everyday living
expenses not to mention the high cost of medical bills that old age
entails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Justice Cruz aptly stated in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Teodoro</u></span> <u>J.</u> <u>Santiago</u> <u>v.</u> <u>COA</u>,
(G.R. No. 92284, July 12, 1991):</p>

<blockquote>"Retirement laws should be interpreted liberally in favor of
the retiree because their intention is to provide for his sustenance, and
hopefully even comfort, when he no longer has the stamina to continue earning
his livelihood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After devoting the best
years of his life to the public service, he deserves the appreciation of a
grateful government as best concretely expressed in a generous retirement
gratuity commensurate with the value and length of his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That generosity is the least he should expect
now that his work is done and his youth is gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even as he feels the weariness in his bones
and glimpses the approach of the lengthening shadows, he should be able to
luxuriate in the thought that he did his task well, and was rewarded for
it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For as long as these retired Justices are entitled under laws
which continue to be effective, the government can not deprive them of their
vested right to the payment of their pensions.</p>
