<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That plaintiffs' mother aforesaid as <span class="SpellE">predessor</span>-in-interest (sic) declared the property for

plaintiffs in favor of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank and due to the
existing war conditions at the time, the possession, management and supervision
of the land was entrusted to Eduardo Castillo reposing in him the (sic) full
trust and confidence;</blockquote>

1977, plaintiff spouses left Manila and engaged in several business ventures in
the provinces and stayed for so long a time in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
Valley in northern Luzon and often times (sic) traveled to far-away places

were there transactions entered into by plaintiffs with any person or persons,
natural or juridical with respect to their undivided half portion;<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That after plaintiffs have returned from the
provinces and upon arrival from abroad later in 1977, they decided to get their
share from their brother Eduardo Castillo as he was entrusted but the latter
being sickly then could not give the explanation and after conference with his
wife, Paula Castillo, the latter told the plaintiffs that she and her husband
Castillo (Eduardo) did not know the mysterious transactions that transpired in
the transfer or registration of the above property to Vicente Madrigal (under
Transfer Certificate <span style="">Title No. 72066)
and upon verification thereof, an alleged deed of sale executed by plaintiffs
and Eduardo Castillo appears on the back of the title but in truth and in fact,
<u>plaintiffs had never signed any </u></span><u>document in favor of Vicente
Madrigal contrary to what appears thereon</u>; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and subsequently transferred by Vicente Madrigal to

recovering his property (Mariano Castillo) in his capacity as a registered
co-owner peacefully but of <span style="">(sic) </span>no
avail for<span style=""> the defendant Susana Realty
Inc. refused to heed to the inquiry and hence this present action;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“12.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That the transfer of the property under
litigation in favor of the late Vicente Madrigal was done thru fraud,
simulation, illegality and serious irregularity equivalent to nullity and
inexistence of contract and follows that the Transfer Certificate of Title No.
36280 under the name of defendant Susana Realty Inc. is null and void and
without any effect whatsoever</u> either under the Civil Code or under the Land
Registration Act especially so that the transactions entered on the title took
place during war time and without supporting papers or documents available up
to the present time;</blockquote>

for the reason that they were deprived of the possession, ownership and fruits
or income of the property in question and to which they demand from the herein
defendant heirs of Vicente Madrigal and/or Susana Realty Inc. in such amount as
may be proved during the trial." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the complaint states no cause of action;
and (b) the cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1980</st1:date>,
the trial court dismissed the complaint (pp. 120-126, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the
decision was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1982</st1:date> (pp. 44-52, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the present <span style="">petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised by petitioners may be grouped into:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not (1) petitioners' action for
annulment of contract and transfer certificate of title and/or <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> with damages is subject to prescription; and
(2) the complaint states a cause of action against private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege that a reading of paragraphs 9 and 10 of their
complaint <span style="">reveals </span>that they
impugn the existence and validity of the alleged deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As contained therein, petitioners never <span style="">entere</span>d<span style=""> </span>into any transaction with any person conveying<span style=""> </span>the subject property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not sign any document in favor of
any one neither did they give any one authorization for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, consent and cause did not exist in
the execution of the deed of sale, invoking Articles 1318<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>,

and 1409 (3)<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, pursuant to
Article 1410 of the Civil Code, an action for the declaration of the
inexistence of a contract does not prescribe.</p>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing petitioners' complaint on the ground of
prescription, the trial court opined (p. 123, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
any action for annulment of the deed and TCT 72066 should have been instituted
within ten (10) years from the accrual of the cause of action, that, (sic) is,
ten years from 1943 when the deed was executed at the earliest, or ten years
from 1944 at the latest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This action was
filed on December 17, 1979, or after more than 30 years from 1943 and 1944.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action, therefore, has long
prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court of Appeals expressed the same
opinion (p. 51, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
even as We consider that there was fraud in the registration and the issuance
of title in favor of defendant Madrigal creating thereby a constructive trust
in favor of the plaintiffs, the remedy of the plaintiffs is an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> within ten (10) years from the registration of
the property in the name of defendant Madrigal (<span class="SpellE">Alzona</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Capunitan</span>, 4 SCRA 450; Gonzales v. Jimenez 13
SCRA, 80).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the filing of the
complaint was way beyond the ten-year period of limitation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both courts ruled incorrectly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is evident in paragraphs 9, 10 and 12 of the complaint, <u>supra</u>,
that petitioners sought the declaration of the inexistence of the deed of sale
because of the absence of their consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, following the provision of Article 1410 of the Civil Code, this
kind of action is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
is likewise <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span> because its basis is the
alleged void contract of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
pronouncement is certainly far from novel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We have encountered similar situations in the past which We resolved in
the same manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of these is the
case of <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span>, et al., v. <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span>,
et al., G.R. No. 73275, May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 59, 73:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
the instant case, however, we are dealing not with a <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>
contract tainted with fraud, mistake, undue influence, violence or intimidation
that can justify its nullification, but with a contract that is null and void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Paulina</span> <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span>
declared under oath in her complaint that she signed the deeds of sale without
knowing what they were, which means that her consent was not merely marred by
the above-stated vices, so as to make the contracts <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>,
but that she had not given her consent at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Lack of consent <span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> </span>made the deeds of sale void altogether
[<span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ferrales</span>, 105
SCRA 359] <span style="">and rendered them subject to
attack at any time, conformably to the rule in Article 1410 that an action to
declare the inexistence of void contracts 'does not prescribe.'<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We have consistently ruled that when
there is a showing of such illegality, the property registered is deemed to be
simply held in trust for the real owner by the person in whose name it is
registered, and the former then has the right to sue for the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The action for the purpose is also <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, there should be no debate that the action for damages
against private respondents has already prescribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance with Article 1144 of the Civil
Code<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
it should have been brought within ten (10) years from the date of the sale to
Vicente Madrigal and the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 72066 in
his name on July 12, 1943, if against the heirs of Vicente Madrigal; or within
ten (10) years from the date of the issuance of Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 36280 in the name of Susana Realty, Inc. on May 12, 1954, if against the
firm.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the discussion on the <span class="SpellE">imprescriptibility</span>
of petitioners' action for annulment of contract and transfer certificate of
title and/or <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, the dismissal of their
complaint by the trial court and the Court of Appeals on the ground of failure
to state a cause of action was correct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was also Our ruling in the <span class="SpellE">Baranda</span> case, <u>supra</u>,
(and in other previous cases) that only as long as the property is still in the
name of the person who caused the wrongful registration and has not passed to
an innocent third person for value will an action lie to compel that person to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the property to the real owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, we are in conformity with the
Court of Appeals that (p. 52, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
property subject of the alleged fraudulent registration had already been
conveyed to an innocent party for value which is defendant Susana Realty,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim of plaintiffs that said
defendant is not an innocent purchaser for value is not borne by the
allegations of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Where the complaint for recovery of
ownership and possession of a parcel of land alleges that some of the
defendants bought said land from their co-defendants who had a defective title
thereto but does not allege that the purchasers were purchasers in bad faith or
with notice of the defect in the title of their vendors, there is a failure to
state a cause of action (<span class="SpellE">Galvez</span>, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span> y de la Paz, et al., 119 Phil. 612).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of this failure, private respondent
Susana Realty, Inc. is presumed to be an innocent purchaser for value and in
good faith, entitled to protection under the law (see <span class="SpellE">Tiburcio</span>,
et al. v. People's <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Homesite</span></span><span style=""> </span>and Housing Corporation, et al., 106
Phil. 477).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is hereby DENIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals dated
