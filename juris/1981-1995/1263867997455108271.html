decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the Court of Appeals dated April 19, 1972
dismissing the appeal of herein petitioner which sought the reversal of the
decision<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> of the Court of Agrarian Relations, Branch II-A, <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
dated March 23, 1971 dismissing his <span style="">complaint
for </span>repossession of his land on the ground of personal <span style="">cultivation; </span>and the resolution dated
August 17, 1972 <span style="">denying the motion for
reconsideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts of the case are
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On March 2, 1970, plaintiff-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span> filed an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
on the ground of personal cultivation under Section 36 (1) of the Agricultural
Land Reform Code with the Court of Agrarian Relations, Fourth Regional
District, Branch II-A, <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex
"A", p. 9) against defendants-respondents <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blaza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> who are agricultural lessees of landholdings
situated at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Colosboa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, with areas of
1 1/2 hectares and 3 hectares, respectively (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
Annex "B", p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff-petitioner <span style="">alleges
</span>in his complaint that he is the owner and landholder of those
landholdings under agricultural leasehold by defendants-respondents; that he
desires and intends to personally cultivate the aforesaid landholdings, with
the aid of members of his immediate family, and that defendants-respondents
were notified in writing at least one agricultural year previous to the filing
of the action (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex "A", p. 9).</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants-respondents filed their joint answers admitting that
plaintiff-petitioner is their agricultural <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> admits that he was duly notified as alleged in the
complaint while <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Blaza</span>
denies having received any such notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As a special defense, defendants-respondents
aver that <span style="">plaintiff-petitioner </span>was
motivated by vindictiveness in seeking to eject defendants-respondents from
their respective landholdings (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Annex
"B", p. 20).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At the pre-trial, the
parties entered into the following stipulations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Stipulations</u> <u>of</u> <u>facts</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a) That the
plaintiff is the owner-a<span style="">gricultural-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> </span>of the landholding in question, while the
defendants are the agricultural lessees thereon;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b) That the
area of defendant <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> <span class="SpellE">Blaza's</span>
landholding is 1 <span style="">1/2 hectares </span><span style="">while </span>that of
<span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso's</span> landholding
is 3 hectares, both located at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Colosboa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cuyapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
which has been declared as Land Reform Area on May 13, 1968;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"c) That the defendants admit that the landholding in question
is covered by TCT No. NT-26924 in the name of the plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"d) That the defendants were notified of the <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u>
intention of the plaintiff for personal cultivation, but they deny its
validity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>The</u> <u>only</u> <u>issue</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>resolved</u> <u>is</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Whether the plaintiff should be allowed to personally
cultivate the landholdings in question." (<u>Ibid</u>.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After due trial, the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">rendered its decision,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"IN VIEW </span>OF ALL
THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the complaint for lack of
merit, with costs against the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>IT <span style="">IS </span>SO
ORDERED." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 16).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ancheta</span></span><span style=""> appealed to the Court of Appeals, which </span>appeal
was denied in a decision dated <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="4">April
 19, 1972</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed for
lack of cause of action in view of the provisions of Section 7, Republic Act
No. 6389, without pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 26-27).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review, which was previously denied for
non-compliance with the Rules requiring:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(a) the submission of the record on appeal as filed in the Court of
Appeals; and (b) the verification of the petition, by this Court <span style="">in a 15 </span>September 1972 resolution (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Resolution, p. 38).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Petitioner moved for the
reconsideration </span>of the said order of denial (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 39-40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="2" month="10">2 October 1972</st1:date>, this Court gave due course to the
instant petition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, Resolution, p. 43).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner filed his brief (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 47).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the private respondents failing to file
their brief within the extended period which expired on January 6, 1973, the
Court resolved to consider the case submitted for decision without said
respondents' brief (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>53).</p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, petitioner made the following assignments of error:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
PETITIONER HEREIN ACTED <span style="">IN BAD </span>FAITH;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN PREMATURELY
HOLDING THAT THE PETITIONER HEREIN AND/OR HIS <span style="">FARM </span>HOUSEHOLD IS INCAPABLE TO PERFORM PERSONAL CULTIVATION;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF APPEALS <span style="">ERRED IN </span>HOLDING THAT IT IS DISPUTABLE
WHETHER DIONISIO ANCHETA, APPELLANT'S FORMER PROTEGEE, WHO <span style="">IS </span>NOW
MARRIED AND LIVING SEPARATELY FROM HIM IS WILLING TO PERSONALLY ATTEND TO THE
CULTIVATION <span style="">OF SAID </span>PROPERTIES;
AND</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE COURT OF APPEALS <span style="">ERRED IN </span>HOLDING THAT REPUBLIC ACT <span style="">NO. 6389 HAS </span>RETROACTIVE EFFECT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Brief for the Petitioner, p.1, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. <span style="">47)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The primary issue to be </span>resolved
in <span style="">this case, is whether or not
petitioner has the right to eject private respondents on the ground of personal
cultivation under Section 36 (1) of </span>Republic <span style="">Act </span>No. <span style="">3844 (as amended).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition is without
merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">Court of Appeals,
evidently erred in applying retroactively Republic Act No. 6389 particularly
with respect to personal cultivation as a ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that R.A. 6389, which </span>removed
personal cultivation as <span style="">a ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> </span>of tenant/lessee, cannot be given
retroactive effect in the absence of a statutory provision for retroactivity or
a clear implication of the law to that effect (Castro v. Castro, 128 SCRA 519
[1984]; <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> v. Adriano, 133 SCRA 421 [1984];
Gallardo v. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, 161 SCRA 500 [1988]; <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, 177 SCRA 294
[1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we cannot ignore the undisputed findings of the agrarian
court which remained undisturbed by the Court of Appeals that petitioner was in
bad faith because <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span>
is economically well off and is old and sickly and cannot work on the land
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ancheta</span> from whom he expects help, is now married and
living separately from <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also found that <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span>
was motivated by hatred and vindictiveness against private respondent <span class="SpellE">Canuto</span> <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> whom he blamed for
the loss of his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These findings are supported by substantial
evidence on record particularly in his rebuttal testimony on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1970</st1:date> (Original T.S.N.,
pp. 68-70), which are sufficient <span style="">in </span>this case being an agrarian case where
all that is required is mere substantial evidence (Castro v. Court of Appeals,
169 SCRA 383 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While petitioner
correctly pointed out that a presumption of <u><span style="">bona</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>fide</u>
intention is inherent in the filing of an action for personal cultivation under
Section 36(1) of the Agricultural Land Reform Code, still like other disputable
presumptions, the same can be overcome by evidence to the contrary; such as the
facts brought out during the trial, showing bad faith and malice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judicial notice should be taken of the
pernicious practice of many landowners who resort to filing cases of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">ejectment</span></span><span style=""> against </span>their
tenants based on personal cultivation <span style="">in
</span>retaliation to harass tenants who were determined to enforce the rights
granted them by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">More than that, on both <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> and
equitable grounds, this Court as arbiter of agrarian justice, has generally
upheld the tenants' security of tenure (<span class="SpellE">Primero</span> v.
Court of Agrarian Relations and <span class="SpellE">Sinforoso</span> <span class="SpellE">Quion</span>, 101 Phil. 675 [1957]; Pineda v. De Guzman, 21 SCRA
1450 [1967]; <span class="SpellE">Quilantang</span> v. Court of Appeals, 48 SCRA
294 [1972]) or the right of the tenant <span style="">to
</span>the enjoyment and possession of his <span class="SpellE">farmholding</span>
which has been created, conferred, protected and guaranteed by the police power
of the state in compliance with the mandate of the Constitution expressed in
Article II, Section 5 of the 1935 Constitution (as well as in the 1973 and 1987
Constitutions).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In pursuance thereof,
the Agricultural Land Reform Code was enacted to help small farmers and to
uplift their economic status by providing them a modest standard of
living.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law further protects them by
conferring upon them security of tenure over the landholding they work on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that the leasehold
relation cannot be extinguished by the mere expiration of the term or <span style="">period in a </span>leasehold
contract or by the sale, alienation, transfer or conveyance of the legal
possession of the landholding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tenant can only be ejected by the Court <u>for</u> <u><span style="">cause</span></u><span style=""> </span>(Code
of Agrarian Reform of the Philippines with Notes and Comments, <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> L. Agustin, pp. 26-45, 1981 edition; De Jesus v. <span style="">Intermediate
Appellate </span>Court, 175 SCRA 559 [1989]), and such cause for dispossession
must be proven and justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, it is this Court's duty to protect
the poor tenants/agricultural lessees against the harassment and vindictiveness
of their landlord, thus giving substance to the security of tenure provisions
of our law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals
is AFFIRMED except as to the application of Republic Act No. 6389 which should
be <u>prospective</u> merely (that is, not retroactive).</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
