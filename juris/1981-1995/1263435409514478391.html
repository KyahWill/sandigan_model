<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On January 30, 1985, the accused still failed to appear.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

he was adopting the testimony of prosecution witness Ernesto Tamayo as evidence
for the accused.  Thereafter, the
defense rested its case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">11, </span>1985,
judgment was rendered against the bonding company for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY">On June 15, 1985, the trial court rendered its decision finding

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On August 16, 1985,
counsel for the accused filed a notice of appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trial </span><u>in
absentia</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was perfectly valid,
having been held in accordance with Article IV, Section 19, of the 1973
Constitution, then in force, which has been reproduced </span><u>verbatim</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in Article III, Section 14(2) of the 1987
Constitution, providing in part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>However, after arraignment, trial may proceed notwithstanding the
absence of the accused provided that he has been duly notified and his failure
to appear is unjustifiable.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of this rule is to speed up the disposition of
criminal cases, trial of which could in the past be indefinitely deferred, and
many times completely abandoned, because of the defendant's escape.  The old case of People v. Avanceña<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
required his presence at certain stages of the trial which as a result, had to
be discontinued <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>long as the
defendant had not reappeared or remained at large.  As his right to be present at these stages was then held not
waivable even by his escape, such escape thus operated to the fugitive's
advantage, and in mockery of the authorities, insofar <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>the trial could not proceed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>long as he had not been recaptured.</p>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine laid down in that case has been modified by the Bill
of Rights, which now allows trial <u>in absentia</u>.  Now the prisoner cannot by simply escaping thwart his continued
prosecution and possibly eventual conviction provided only that:  <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a) </span>he
has been arraigned; b<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">) </span>he has been duly notified of the trial; and c) his
failure to appear is unjustified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the old doctrine, trial <u>in absentia</u> of the escapee
could not be held because he could not be duly notified thereof.  Under the present rule, the fugitive is
deemed to have waived such notice precisely because he has escaped, and it is
also this escape that makes his failure to appear at his trial
unjustified.  Escape can never be a
legal justification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the past, his escape "rewarded" him by postponing
all further proceedings against him and in effect ultimately absolving him of
the charge he was facing.  Under the
present rule, his escape will, legally speaking, operate to his disadvantage as
he will be unable to attend his trial, which will continue even in his absence
and most likely result in his conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to be present at one's trial may now be waived except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">only </span>at that stage where the
prosecution intends to present witnesses who will identify the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The defendant's escape will be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>waiver of this right and the inability of
the court to notify him of the subsequent hearings will not prevent it from
continuing with his trial.  He will be
deemed to have received due notice.  The
same fact of his escape will make his failure to appear unjustified because he
has, by escaping, placed himself beyond the pale, and protection, of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, the accused has forfeited the right to
appeal.  The record shows that after
arraignment and during the trial, Agbulos jumped bail and has not been
apprehended to date.  The last time he
appeared in court was on April 25, 1984, when the prosecution rested its
case.  The rest of the trial was held <u>in</u>
<u>absentia</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">resulting in </span>the
judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 124, Section 8, of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that the court may, "upon motion of the appellee or on its own
motion, dismiss the appeal if the appellant escapes from prison or confinement
or jumps bail or flees to a foreign country during the pendency of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>appeal." We have held that once
an accused escapes from prison or confinement or jumps bail or flees to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>foreign
country, he loses his standing in court and unless he surrenders or submits to
its jurisdiction is deemed to have waived any right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">seek </span>relief from the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the appellant has remained at large even as
he hopes that his appeal will succeed and he can then appear before the Court
to claim his victory.  He hopes in vain.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is DISMISSED.  Let the records of this case be remanded to
the trial court for issuance of the mittimus.  SO ORDERED.</p>
