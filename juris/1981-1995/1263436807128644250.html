				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue in this
petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> is whether or not the Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Cotabato, Branch I, in Cotabato City,
gravely abused its discretion in <u>denying</u> petitioners’ motion for
extension of time to file their answer in Civil Case No. 2518, </span><span style="">in </span><u>declaring</u> <span style="">petitioners in default and in <u>rendering</u>
its decision of 17 March 1980 which, among other things, decreed the legal
separation of petitioner Enrico L. Pacete and private respondent Concepcion
Alanis and held to be null and void <u>ab</u> <u>initio</u> the marriage of
Enrico L. Pacete to Clarita de la Concepcion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 October 1979, Concepcion Alanis filed with the court below
a complaint for the declaration of nullity of the marriage between her
erstwhile husband Enrico L. Pacete and one Clarita de la Concepcion, as well as
for legal separation (between Alanis and Pacete), accounting and separation of
property.  In her complaint, she averred
that she was married to Pacete on 30 April 1938 before the Justice of the Peace
of Cotabato, Cotabato; that they had a child named Consuelo who was born on 11
March 1943; that Pacete subsequently contracted (in 1948) a second marriage
with Clarita de la Concepcion in Kidapawan, North Cotabato; that she learned of
such marriage only on 01 August 1979; that during her marriage to Pacete, the
latter acquired vast property consisting of large tracts of land, fishponds and
several motor vehicles; that he fraudulently placed the several pieces of
property either in his name and Clarita or in the names of his children with
Clarita and other "dummies;" that Pacete ignored overtures for an
amicable settlement; and that reconciliation between her and Pacete was
impossible since he evidently preferred to continue living with Clarita.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants were each served with summons on 15 November
1979.  They filed a motion for an
extension of twenty (20) days from 30 November 1979 within which to <span style="">file an answer.  The court granted the motion.  On 18 December 1979, appearing through a new counsel, the defendants
filed a second motion for an extension of another thirty (30) days from 20
December 1979.  On 07 January 1980, the
lower court granted the motion but only for twenty (20) days to be counted from
20 December 1979 or until 09 January 1980.  The Order of the court was mailed to defendants' counsel on 11 January
1980.  Likely still unaware of the court
order, the defendants, on 05 February 1980, again filed another motion (dated
18 January 1980) for an extension of "fifteen (15) days counted from the
expiration of the 30-day period previously sought" within which to file an
answer.  The following day, or on 06
February 1980, the court denied this last motion on the ground that it was
"filed after the original period given x x x as first extension had
expired."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The <span style="">provision
has been taken from Article 30 of the California Civil Code,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and it is, in substance, reproduced in

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 101 reflects the

<blockquote>"The policy of Article 101 of the new Civil Code, calling for
the intervention of the state attorneys in case of uncontested proceedings for
legal separation (and of annulment of marriages, under Article 88), is to
emphasize that marriage is more than a mere contract; that it is a social
institution in which the state is vitally interested, so that its continuation
or interruption can not be made to depend upon the parties themselves (Civil
Code, Article 52; Adong vs. Cheong Gee, 43 Phil. 43; Ramirez v. Gmur, 42 Phil.
855; Goitia v. Campos, 35 Phil. 252).  It is consonant with this policy that the inquiry by the Fiscal should
be allowed to focus upon any relevant matter that may indicate whether the
proceedings for separation or annulment are fully justified or not."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 103 of the Civil
Code, now Article 58 of the Family Code, further mandates that an action for
legal separation must "in no case be tried before six months shall have
elapsed since the filing of the petition," obviously in order to provide
the parties a "cooling-off" period.  In this interim, the court should take steps toward getting the parties
to reconcile.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The significance of the
above substantive provisions of the law is further underscored by the inclusion
of the following provision in Rule 18 of the Rules of Court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6.  <u>No</u> <u>defaults</u>
<u>in</u><span style=""> </span><u>actions</u> <u>for</u><span style=""> </span><u>annulments</u> <u>of</u> <u>marriage</u>
<u>or</u> <u>for</u> <u>legal</u> <u>separation</u><span style="">. - </span>If the defendant in an action for annulment of marriage or
for legal separation fails to answer, the court shall order the prosecuting
attorney to investigate <span style="">whether or not
a collusion between the parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to
intervene for the State in order to see to it that the evidence submitted is
not fabricated."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The special proscriptions
on actions that can put the integrity of marriage to possible jeopardy are
impelled by no less than the State's interest in the marriage relation and its
avowed intention not to leave the matter within the exclusive domain and the
vagaries of the parties to alone dictate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear that the
petitioner did, in fact, specifically pray for legal separation.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That other remedies, whether principal or
incidental, have likewise been sought in the same action cannot dispense, nor
excuse compliance, with any of the statutory requirements aforequoted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
