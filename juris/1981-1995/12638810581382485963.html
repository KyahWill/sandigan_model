chased away by two members of the group of robbers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED?APPELLANT
OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF PROOF BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Appellant's brief, p. 9)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and third assigned errors question the trial court's
finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant contends that there was no positive identification made of
him by <span class="SpellE">Maricor</span> <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>, the
sole prosecution eyewitness because of the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first, despite having known the appellant to
be a relative of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> did not pinpoint him right away to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> admitted that
she knew the identity of the appellant even before the incident and she knew
that the appellant was a relative of <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>
(TSN, June 30, 1988, p. 13) but she failed to mention the identity of the
appellant in her affidavit and she denied knowing by name the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She testified that she was able to identify
him only due to his body build and white hair (TSN, June 29, 1988, p. 11)
Second, <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> mentioned in her affidavit only
matters pertaining to the height, cap, shoes, and green jacket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She failed to <span style="">mention </span>the appellant's white hair when she gave the description
of the appellant to the police citing the flimsy reason that this was not asked
of her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 29, 1988, p. 45) It
is in fact, doubtful that <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> even saw the
appellant's white hair as she said that the appellant was wearing a cap.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Another thing allegedly
that makes <span class="SpellE">Coleto's</span> </span>identification of the
appellant more doubtful is the fact that <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> owed
so much to the victims that she would do anything to avenge their death, even to
the extent of testifying falsely against the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant alleges that <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> may have been motivated to testify against him
because of the long standing feud (started in 1963) with the <span class="SpellE">Azarcons</span> (family of <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio's</span>
wife) over the appellant's fishpond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
states that in an attempt to get his fishpond and harvest his coconuts, he got
into a fight with Samuel <span class="SpellE">Azarcon</span>, younger brother of <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio's</span> wife, whom he subsequently killed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, December 22, 1989, p. 24) However, he
was found to have killed Samuel in self-defense (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
12, Records, pp.668-679)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Aside from these
circumstances that belie <span class="SpellE">Coleto's</span> positive
identification of the appellant, the appellant also contends that <span class="SpellE">Coleto's</span> testimony in itself is not credible. Throughout
her testimony, there was no indication that <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>
or any of the three victims </span>gave <span style="">a
</span>hint <span style="">as </span>to the identity
of the appellant despite the fact that <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>
and the appellant knew each other <span style="">as </span>they
were distant cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is unnatural
that the victim having known his killer did not even plead to the appellant to
spare his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it is also not
in keeping with normal behavior for the appellant to ask if <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>
was the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, <span style="">as </span>narrated by <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>, since the
appellant knew the victim already.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guilt of the appellant has been established beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The above-mentioned circumstances
that negate the positive identification of the appellant by <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>
were all satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The failure of <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>
to mention appellant's identity in her affidavit despite having seen the
appellant several times before the incident (TSN, June 30, 1988, p. 13) is
attributed to the fact that she did not know the appellant's name at that time.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She however, admitted in open court that
although she does not know the name of the appellant, she can recognize him if <span style="">she </span>sees him again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 29, 1988, p. 11) It <span style="">was </span>not only the name of the appellant
that <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> could not remember but she demonstrated
her facility not to remember names also with regards to the police
investigators who talked to her after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she could not remember the
names of the policemen who were investigating her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 29, 1988, pp. 27-28)</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the failure of <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> to
mention the white hair of the appellant in her affidavit is not fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been ruled that affidavits being taken
<u>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> usually are incomplete and often
inaccurate, caused sometimes from partial suggestions, sometimes for want of
suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable
to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction
of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all
that belongs to the subject (People v. <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, G.R.
No. 96230, May 27, 1991 citing People v. Laredo, 185 SCRA 383, 392-393, [1990])</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the description given by <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>
of the accused in her affidavit is very general. She just mentioned matters
about height, cap, shoes and jacket.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibit 5, Records, p. 60)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Coleto's</span> identification of the
appellant is not tainted with improper motive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> herself admitted that she would do
anything to help the <span class="SpellE">Cosmianos</span> (TSN, June 29, 1988,
p. 29).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is then illogical for her to
point to the appellant if he was not really one of the perpetrators since this
would then stop the police from looking for the real killers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> had only one
<span class="GramE">motive, that</span> is to seek justice for the killing of the
<span class="SpellE">Cosmianos</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motive attributed to <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> by the
appellant is not substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The feud
started way back in 1963, and the killing of Samuel <span class="SpellE">Azarcon</span>
happened in 1978, before <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> even went to live
with the <span class="SpellE">Cosmianos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> may not even have known of the feud as
it was between the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">Azarcons</span> and not
the <span class="SpellE">Cosmianos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, between 1978 and 1985, there was no evident manifestation of the
feud, so <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> may still have been unaware of the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>,
young as she was, knew the gravity of the crime that she imputed to the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to believe that at
her age, there would be hatred and vengeance in her heart towards the appellant
as to falsely testify against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Peop</u><u><span style="">le</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Paco</span></u>, 170 SCRA 681, 688, (1989) we held:</p>

<blockquote>"The motive imputed to the prosecution witness because of the
facility by which the accused can fabricate the same must be proved by clear
and sufficient evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In the absence of convincing
evidence that the principal prosecution witness acted because of improper
motives, the presumption is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is
entitled to full faith and credit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the contention of the appellant on the incredibility of the
victims' not having pleaded with the appellant despite their knowing him and
that of the appellant's having asked <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span> if
he was the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, it has been held that
there is no standard form of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking
occurrence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">working
of human minds, when placed under emotional stress, are</span> unpredictable
and people react differently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v.
Ponce, G.R. No. 83694, May 31, 1991) Aside from this, the victims may not have
seen the perpetrators as they were asked to lie face down on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 29, 1988, p. 6) <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span>, on the other hand, even if he had the
opportunity to recognize the perpetrators may not have seen the need to plead
for his life as he may have thought that they were just out to rob them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With regards to the question to <span class="SpellE">Exuperancio</span> if he was the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain, <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> did not categorically state that it
was the appellant who asked such <span class="GramE">question,</span> she said
that she <span style="">could </span>not remember
anymore who asked that question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,
June 30, 1988, pp. 18-19)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant was positively identified by <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The facts outlined in the case were conducive
to proper identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">sala</span> where the stabbing took place was lighted by a moron
lamp (TSN, June 29, 1988, p. 47) <span class="GramE">The</span> kitchen where <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> pointed out the food to the accused was also lighted
by another moron lamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The light given
out by the moron lamps although not as bright as that given out by an<span style="">&nbsp; </span>electric light is sufficient to light an
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These moron lamps are self
improvised lamps, where a bottle, such as that of a San Miguel beer bottle, is
filled with kerosene with a cloth serving as a wick.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, June 30, 1988, p. 8) Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span> had the opportunity to see the accused more closely
as she did not leave the kitchen right away after pointing out the food to the
accused but remained standing in the kitchen for a while (TSN, June 29, 1988,
p. 48)</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the positive identification of the appellant by <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>, his defense of alibi will then, have to fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi being inherently weak
cannot prevail against the prosecution's positive identification of the
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Sabellano</span>, G.R. Nos. 93932-33, June 5, 1991; People v. <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, G.R. No. 88098, June 26, 1991) We agree with the

is not enough to prove that the appellant was somewhere when the crime was
committed but that he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime (People v. Arenas,
G.R. No. 92068, June 5, 1991; People v. <span class="SpellE">Carcedo</span>, G.R.
No. L-48085, June 26, 1991) In the case at bar, although the appellant may
prove that he was somewhere else when the crime was committed, he could not
prove that it was physically impossible for him to be at the crime scene or at
the vicinity thereof at the approximate time the crime was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> <span class="SpellE">Azarcon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sual</span>, stating that they saw the appellant at the river of <span class="SpellE">Lankogue</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tapi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cantilan</span> at 4:00 in the afternoon of October 1, 1985 (TSN,
May 19, 1988, p. 14) and at 1:00 <span style="">in </span>the
morning of October 2, 1985 (TSN, May 19, 1988, pp. 27-28) respectively, are
dismissed by the appellant as having no probative value in the second assigned
error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to say that even without <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Maximo's</span> testimonies, <span class="SpellE">Coleto's</span>
testimony standing alone is enough to convict the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that the testimony of a
single eyewitness, if found convincing and trustworthy by the trial court, is
sufficient to support a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Catubig</span>,
G.R. No. 71626, March 22, 1991) In the instant case, the trial court found the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Maricor</span> <span class="SpellE">Coleto</span>
to be credible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
observed:</p>

<span class="SpellE">Intoy</span> as among the Robbers who robbed and massacred
the deceased-victims, the Court has no doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She stood firm and was unshaken <span style="">by
the long and grueling cross-examinations of the three defense counsel,
delivering a straight forward and natural style of testimonies, which appealed
to the Court as a sign of sincerity, let alone the fact that her story is
logical, probable and very credible." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
41)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court designated the crime as robbery with multiple <span class="GramE">homicide</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in

regardless of the number of <span style="">homicides
