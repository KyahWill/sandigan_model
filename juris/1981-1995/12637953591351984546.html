private respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, sometime in
March 1967, began work as an auto painter in the premises of petitioner
Broadway Motors, Inc. located at <st1:street><st1:address>1232 United Nations
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract was signed by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> as "Contractor" and Mr. Johnny L. <span class="SpellE">Chieng</span>, Parts and Service Operations Manager of petitioner
Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
worked as an auto painter for a period of eighteen (18) years, until <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="1">23 January 1985</st1:date> when he was barred
from entering the premises of petitioner Corporation, and his relationship with
it effectively terminated, because of his alleged involvement in a fist-fight
with the shop superintendent of Broadway Motors the day before.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="2">21 February 1985</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> commenced an action for illegal dismissal
with the National Capital Region Arbitration Branch of the National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
Complaint, which was docketed as NLRC Case No. 2-587-85, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
sought recovery from petitioner Corporation of (1) separation pay in the amount
of P66,676.95, on the basis of an alleged monthly income of P7,408.55, (2)
moral damages of P50,000.00, and (3) attorney's fees of P10,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 7 January 1986, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint upon the ground
that under the Work Contract and an "Addendum to Work Contract" dated
28 April 1984,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, having supplied the workers -- himself included
-- who performed the auto painting jobs for petitioner Corporation, was a mere
contractor and could not, therefore, be considered as the latter's
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From this decision, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> interposed an appeal to the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="2">4 February 1987</st1:date>,
public respondent NLRC rendered a Decision,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Decision appealed from is reversed and a new
judgment entered ordering the respondent to pay complainant separation pay in
the sum of FORTY FIVE THOUSAND (P45,000.00) PESOS plus 10% thereof as and for
attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In reversing the decision of the Labor
Arbiter, public respondent NLRC found that a valid and binding
employer-employee relationship had existed between petitioner Corporation and <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> was dismissed without any investigation having
been previously conducted by petitioner Corporation to ascertain his participation
in the fist-fight within company premises, his dismissal was, accordingly,
declared illegal by public respondent NLRC for non-compliance with the
requirements of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful scrutiny of the records of this case, the Court
considers that petitioner Corporation has not sufficiently shown that
respondent NLRC had acted with grave abuse of discretion, or without or in
excess of jurisdiction in rendering its decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="2">4 February 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Four factors are generally considered in determining the
existence of an employer-employee relationship, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the manner of selection and engagement of
the putative employee; (b) the mode of payment of wages; (c) the presence or
absence of a power of dismissal; and (d) the presence or absence of a power to
control the putative employee's conduct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is this latter factor, the so-called "control test", which
is the most important criterion in such determination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The record shows that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> was hired directly
by petitioner Corporation to work in the latter's auto repair shop as an auto
painter, which fact is evidenced by the undated Work Contract executed between <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and petitioner Corporation through its
authorized representative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
petitioner corporation reserved unto itself the power of dismissal is evident
from the fact that petitioner Corporation unilaterally undertook to terminate <span class="SpellE">Apolinario's</span> relationships with itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, it appears that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
and his men (designated in the Work Contract as "Contract Workers")
were compensated for the jobs they performed in lump sum payments described as
"payment for subcontract painting" or other repair job, from which
amounts an unexplained "three percent (3%) of fifteen percent (15%) withholding
tax" was deducted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further
appears that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> invoiced, under the
designation of "VM Automotive Repair Service", to petitioner
Corporation the salaries of his "Contract Workers" on which amounts,
a three percent (3%) "sales tax" was added.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "Work Contract" also provided
that Broadway Motors would negotiate only with <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
on any work order, and would refrain from dealing with any member of <span class="SpellE">Apolinario's</span> group of "Contract Workers."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the power to control <span class="SpellE">Apolinario's</span>
conduct, it appears from the stipulations of the Work Contract that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his "Contract Workers" were
required not only to keep regular working hours, but to render overtime service
as well, when such was necessitated either by the volume or immediacy of the
work.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
They were not allowed to negotiate with customers regarding the performance of
any additional work beyond that which had been authorized by petitioner
Corporation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Any defect in the workmanship of their jobs was subject to correction by
petitioner Corporation's designated supervisors and inspectors even as the work
was still in progress, and not just after the same had already been completed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his men were expressly
required to abide by petitioner Corporation's regulations and policies,
"particularly on the wearing of uniforms and identification cards",
which ID cards had to be worn at all times while within the work premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Apolinario's</span>
"casual workers" were additionally required to deposit their ID cards
with petitioner Corporation's security guard at the end of the working day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In other words, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his "Contract
Workers" were under the direct control and supervision of the supervisors
and managers of petitioner Corporation from the very moment they entered the
work premises at the beginning of the working day, all throughout the
performance of their duties for the day, until shop closing time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Corporation urges that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
was not its own employee but, rather, an independent contractor who conducted
his own separate business under the trade name of "VM Automotive Repair
Service" and had his own "Contract Workers".</p>

<p class="BODY">The indices of an owner-independent contractor relationship are
set out in Section 8 of Rule VIII, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing
the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 8 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Job contracting</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Job contracting" must be distinguished from
"labor-only" contracting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Labor-only" contracting is defined in Section 9 of Rule VIII,
Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code, in the following
terms:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Labor-only

<p class="BODY">The legal effect of a finding that a contractor was not a true
independent contractor or "job contractor" but, rather, merely a
"labor-only" contractor was explained in <u>Philippine Bank of
Communications v. National Labor Relations Commission, et al</u>.:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> The 'labor-only' contractor - i.e. 'the person or
intermediary' - is considered 'merely as an agent of the employer.' The
employer is made by the statute responsible to the employees of the 'labor
only' contractor <u>as if such employee had been directly employed by the
employer</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <u>where 'labor
only' contracting exists in a given case, the statute itself implies or
establishes an employer-employee relationship between the employer (the owner
of the project) and the employees of the 'labor only' contractor</u>, this time
for a <u>comprehensive</u> purpose:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'employer for purposes of <u>this Code</u>, to prevent <u>any</u>
violation or circumvention of <u>any provision of this Code</u>.' The law in
effect holds <u>both</u> the employer and the 'labor-only' contractor
responsible to the latter's employees for the more effective safeguarding of
the employees' rights under the Labor Code." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, a finding that a contractor was a
"labor-only" contractor is equivalent to a finding that an
employer-employee relationship existed between the owner and the
"labor-only" contractor including the latter's "Contract
Workers", that relationship being attributed by the law itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Corporation's defense thus compels
us to examine still further the relationship between itself and private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> in terms of the above indices
of contracting -- "job" or "labor-only".</p>

<p class="BODY">We note firstly that, under the Work Contract, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> supplied only "labor and supervision (over
his "Contract Workers") in the performance of automotive body
painting work which the company (i.e., Broadway Motors) may from time to time,
award to him under (the) contract".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> also undertook to "hire and bring in
additional workers as may be required by the company, to handle additional work
load or to accelerate or facilitate completion of work in process."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner Corporation supplied all the tools, equipment, machinery and
materials necessary for <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> to carry out his
assigned painting jobs, which painting jobs were executed by <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his men within the premises owned and
maintained by petitioner Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The control and direction exercised by petitioner Corporation over the
work done by <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his "Contract
Workers" was well-nigh complete, as indicated earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was, furthermore, no evidence adduced
by petitioner Corporation to show that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> had
substantial capital investment in "VM Automotive Repair Service" or
that "VM Automotive Repair Service" carried on, in its own premises,
a car repair business operation separate and distinct from that engaged in by
petitioner Corporation, an operation the tools or equipment of which were owned
by <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and the customers of which were not
customers of Broadway Motors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the
evidence of record reveals is that the alleged "Contract Work"
carried out by <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his "Contract
Workers", excepting overtime work, was performed during regular working
hours six (6) days in a week, which circumstance must have made it virtually
impossible for them to carry on any additional and independent auto painting
business outside the premises of Broadway Motors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
and his men were engaged in the performance of a line of work -- automobile
painting -- which was directly related to, if not an integral part altogether
of the regular business operations of petitioner Corporation -- i.e., that of
an automotive repair shop.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that while there is present in the relationship
between petitioner Corporation and private respondent some factors suggestive of
an owner-independent contractor relationship (e.g., the manner of payment of
compensation to <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and his "Contract
Workers"), many other factors are present which demonstrate that that
relationship is properly characterized as one of employer-employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We conclude, further, that the same factors
indicate the existence of a "labor-only" contracting arrangement
between petitioner Corporation on the one hand as owner, and upon the other
hand, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> as "labor-only" contractor
and his "Contract Workers".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, an employer-employee relationship must be held to have existed
between petitioner Corporation and private respondent, whether considered as a
result of the contractual arrangements between them or as a result of the
operation of the Labor Code (at least from 1974 onwards) and its Implementing
Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows, finally, that the
ruling of public respondent NLRC that petitioner Corporation and private
respondent were employer and employee, respectively, cannot be regarded as
constituting a grave abuse of discretion or as rendered without or in excess of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In respect of public
respondent <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> finding that <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
was dismissed without any opportunity to present his side on the charge against
him of participating in the fist-fight with petitioner Corporation's shop
superintendent, no compelling reason has been shown by the petitioner
Corporation why we should overturn such finding of fact.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> is
DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the public
respondent National Labor Relations Commission dated <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="2">4 February 1987</st1:date> is hereby AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the petitioner.</p>
