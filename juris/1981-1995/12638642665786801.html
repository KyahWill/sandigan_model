				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Taopa</span>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span> and Nestor Francisco were charged with
the crime of robbery with homicide before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The indictment alleged that on or about <st1:date month="11" day="6" year="1980">November
 6, 1980</st1:date>, in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
and acting in conspiracy with one another, they had robbed a taxi driver, <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span>, of his day's
earnings and then stabbed and killed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Only the first three were arrested and arraigned, and after entering a
plea of not guilty, stood trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nestor
Francisco has not, it seems, been apprehended to this day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial resulted in a verdict of
conviction, and the three (3) accused were each sentenced to suffer the penalty
of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>, and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>,
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the amount of P12,000.00 without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the appeal seasonably taken by them to this Court the accused
attempt to make the single point that "the Court <i>a quo</i> had erred in
admitting and utilizing the extrajudicial confessions and statements of
accused-appellants ** (in violation) of their right to counsel guaranteed by
the constitution, and basing the judgment of conviction thereon." The
point is well taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute about the fact that <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alamar</span> was stabbed to death, and his money taken from
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were however no eyeÂ­witnesses
either to his killing, or to the <span class="SpellE">asportation</span> of his
earnings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nobody was presented to
identify the appellants as the perpetrators of the felony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their conviction was anchored primarily on
the written statements given by them in the course of the investigation by
police investigators in which they admitted involvement in the crime,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
considered conjointly with admittedly adequate proof of the <i>corpus delicti</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants' confessions set forth the following facts, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in the evening of
November 6, 1980, at <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, they (Domingo <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span>, Jose <span class="SpellE">Taopa</span>, and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span>), together with Nestor Francisco, boarded the <span class="SpellE">Rubi</span> Rose taxi driven by <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Alamar</span> and asked to be brought to Hillside, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on the way, <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span> pointed a knife at the neck of <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span>
and announced:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Hold-up <span class="SpellE">ito</span>;" <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span> thereupon took
over the steering wheel and the others forced <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span>
to move to the back seat;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>at this point, <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span> struggled and kicked <span class="SpellE">Tarin's</span>
back; <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span> pulled out his nail cutter and with the
small knife attached to it, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span> in the
abdomen;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>further down <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Kennon</span> Road</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span> ordered <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span> to stop the
taxi; then, with Jose <span class="SpellE">Taopa</span> and Nestor Francisco holding
<span class="SpellE">Alamar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span> stabbed the
latter with a knife; Nestor Francisco also stabbed <span class="SpellE">Alamar</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>they dumped <span class="SpellE">Alamar's</span> lifeless body by the roadside and took his
earnings, after which they abandoned the taxi.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The police investigators took the witness stand to identify the
sworn statements, attest to the regularity of their taking, and narrate the
events leading to the appellants' apprehension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The doctor who performed the autopsy deposed on <span class="SpellE">Alamar's</span>
injuries and the cause of his death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, to repeat, no eye-witness testified, and except for their
confessions, no other evidence was introduced to link the appellants to the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants repudiated their confessions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They denied having freely executed the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court nevertheless
convicted them as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, on the strength of
their confessions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellants <span class="SpellE">Olapani</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taopa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarin</span> question their
conviction on the basis of the confessions given by them under custodial
interrogation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the
same are inadmissible in evidence because obtained in violation of their
constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court agrees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> as every one knows, provides for
procedural safeguards to secure the right of a citizen against
self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It grants the person under investigation for
the commission of an offense the rights:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) to remain silent; (2) to counsel; (3) to be informed of such right
to silence and to counsel; and (4) against the use of force, violence, threat,
intimidation or any other means which vitiates the free will; and it declares
any confession obtained in violation of any of said rights, inadmissible in
evidence in any proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record supports the appellants' submissions of infringement
of their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, it is
doubtful whether appellants were indeed effectively <i>informed</i> of their
rights to silence and counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A glance
at their individual confessions at once shows that the statements therein
purporting to demonstrate compliance with the constitutional requisites in
custodial investigations -- said statements being identical in all three
confessions -- fall short of the acceptable norms, <i>viz</i>.:</p>

<blockquote>"Preliminary:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Domingo <span class="SpellE">Taren</span> y
<span class="SpellE">Tresmanio</span>, I am informing you that I am <span class="SpellE">Pfc</span> Gilbert T. <span class="SpellE">Oasan</span> who is assigned
to investigate you in connection with your involvement in a case of robbery
with homicide and robbery with intimidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Before giving any statement in this investigation, I would like to
inform you that under the New Constitution, you have the right to remain
silent, and the right to be assisted by a lawyer at your own choice; if you
cannot afford to get a lawyer, we can refer you to the Integrated Bar of the
Philippines, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Chapter, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City; should you wish to give your statement in this investigation, it will be
under oath and can be used as evidence for or against you in any court
proceedings in the Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Have you fully understood all your rights
mentioned above?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will investigate you in <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> language and I will translate all my questions and
your answers in English.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Do you fully
understand and speak <span class="SpellE">Tagalog</span> very well?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You have the right to remain silent which
means you may not give your statement if you so desire, do you understand?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do you need the services of a lawyer who
will assist you in this investigation so we refer you to the Integrated Bar of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Chapter if you cannot afford to secure a
lawyer?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not need a lawyer to assist me in this
investigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are you then willing to give your free and
voluntary statement even without the assistance of a lawyer and even if it will
be used as evidence for or against you in any court proceedings?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now, about such a lengthy opening question, this Court has had
occasion to remark:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Such a long question followed by a monosyllabic answer does
not satisfy the requirements of the law that the accused be informed of his
rights under the Constitution and our laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, there should be several short and clear questions and every
right explained in simple words in a dialect or language known to the person
under interrogation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The police interrogators knew, since the statements themselves so
disclose, that none of the appellants had gone beyond the elementary level of
education,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
and their limited education was therefore a handicap to a ready and effective
understanding of the meaning and purpose of their constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the duty of the investigating officers
under these circumstances to have exerted a little more effort to ensure that
information of their rights would be adequately transmitted to the appellants
and understood by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, as we have
already also had occasion to rule:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"When the Constitution requires a person under investigation 'to
be informed' of his right to remain silent and to counsel, it must be presumed
to contemplate the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the
ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>* * * In other words, the right of a person
under interrogation 'to be informed' implies a correlative obligation on the
part of the police investigator to explain, and contemplates an effective
communication that results in understanding what is conveyed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Short of this, there is a denial of the
right, as it cannot truly be said that the person has been 'informed' of his
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, since the right 'to be
informed' implies comprehension, the degree of explanation required will necessarily
vary, depending upon the education, intelligence and other relevant personal
circumstances of the person under investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that a simpler and more
lucid explanation is needed where the subject is unlettered.â</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The manner by which, admittedly,
appellants were informed of their rights thus leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if we were to view the proceedings before the police in the
most favorable light, and assume that the appellants really came to understand
their rights, but waived them, and proceeded to answer the questions put to
them, their statements would nonetheless still be inadmissible in evidence
because the waiver had been made without assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the rights of a person under
custodial interrogation are <span class="SpellE">waivable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the waiver must be made not only
voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently, but, in any case, in the presence and
with assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
records do not show that the accused was assisted by counsel in making his waiver,
this defect nullifies and renders his confession inadmissible in evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The confessions of appellants being void and inadmissible in
evidence, and there being no other evidence to support the conviction of
appellants, the judgment appealed is hereby SET ASIDE and the appellants
ACQUITTED of the charge against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
