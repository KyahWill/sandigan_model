This proceeding for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus arose from the
 assumption of jurisdiction by the Deputy Minister of Labor, respondent 
Inciong,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  and his failure 
to order the immediate execution of a decision of the Voluntary 
Arbitrator, then Dean of the University of the Philippines College of 
Law, now Commissioner of Elections, Froilan Bacungan. It was his ruling 
that "the respondent company is under legal obligation to implement the 
general wage increase that it failed to implement effective January 1973
 but that equity demands that such implementation should take into 
account the financial conditions of the Company."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
<p>
It is undisputed that in the collective bargaining Agreement for the 
years 1972 to December 31, 1974, private respondent agreed to give 
salary increases to the employees covered by the agreement during its 
duration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  It did not do 
so. When negotiations between it and petitioner union failed to break 
the impasse, both parties chose a voluntary arbitrator, the then Dean 
Bacungan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  It was further agreed that his decision "shall be final, binding, immediately executory and non-appealable."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  As such, he directed the parties to submit their position papers, after which a hearing would be held.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  Private respondent, in its position paper, admitted the 
non-implementation, but pleaded in justification the occurrence of 
circumstances and events arising after the 1972-1974 collective contract
 was concluded, rendering it unable to comply with its obligation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  After petitioner-union submitted its memo足randum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  the parties were heard, resulting in the above decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  While the petitioner-union, referring to its final, binding, executory
 and non-appealable character asked for its immediate implementation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  private respondent countered by filing a motion for its reconsideration, alleging lack of capacity to pay.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>  It was denied.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  The entire case was then referred to the Chairman of the National 
Labor Relations Commission through the Executive Arbiter, public 
respondent Guillermo C. Medina, who, after determining the amount of 
such monetary award, issued a writ of execution against private 
respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
</p><p>
As to why there was such an assumption of jurisdiction by respondent 
Inciong, is explained in the Comment for respondent public officials 
submitted by the Office of the Solicitor General. It stated that 
conformably to such writ of execution, the Office of the Sheriff served 
garnishment notices to all depository banks of private respondent. The 
consequence was that it issued a memorandum to all its employees, 
informing them of its inability to pay their salaries and wages for 
August 15 and 31, 1978. That was when private respondent, in a letter 
dated August 11, 1978, sought the intervention of the Minister of Labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>
  By virtue of such request, the Minister of Labor referred the matter 
to respondent Inciong, who in turn invited the parties to a conference 
on August 14, 1978.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>  Such a
 conference was held, with private respondent being represented by its 
President, two Vice-Presidents and its counsel. Respondent Union was 
represented by counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup>  
The aforesaid decision was the result, according to such Comment, 
endorsed favorably by the representatives of the parties attending as 
well as the then National Labor Relations Commission Vice-Chairman. That
 is the background of this petition, filed after petitioner-Union 
apparently had lost its patience for the failure to receive the salary 
increases due its members.
</p><p>
The assailed order of respondent Inciong, issued on August 14, 1978, 
reads as follows: "In order to normalize the operations of the RCPI 
pending final settlement of the payment of the obligations of the 
company under the Order of Dean Froilan Bacungan dated February 22, 
1978, the following is hereby ordered for immediate compliance by the 
parties: 1. Management shall pay immediately to all covered workers its 
obligations under the Bacungan Order for June, July and August 1978. 2. 
Starting September 1, 1978, management shall start paying regularly 
every payday its current obligations under the Bacungan order. 3. The 
Minister of Labor shall assume jurisdiction under PD 823 as amended over
 the determination of the formula for the payment of the backpay under 
the Bacungan Order; decision is within 20 working days from first 
hearing. 4. Management shall pay its employees their salaries from 
August 16-31, 1978, and thereafter. 5. The orders of garnishment issued 
by Executive Labor Arbiter Guillermo Medina are hereby lifted effective 
immediately. 6. Management shall file a bond not later than August 18, 
1978 to cover its obligations from June 1973 to May 1978. [So ordered]."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the light of the above facts, the Court is of the opinion and so 
holds that the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator, on whose behalf the
 suit is brought by petitioner-union, should be immediately implemented.
 At the time of the order of respondent Inciong, there was justification
 for the gradual implementation so as "to take into account the 
financial conditions of the company." So it was required in the decision
 of Dean Bacungan. That was in 1978. Private respondent was satisfied. 
It did not appeal. It knew it was required to pay "immediately to all 
covered employees its obligations under the Bacungan order for June, 
July and August, 1978."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup>  Then, starting September 1, 1978, it had to pay "regularly every pay足day its current obligations under the Bacungan order."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup>
  Nothing could be clearer, therefore, than that under the order now 
assailed by petitioner-union, private respondent had no choice except to
 comply with the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator as early as 
September 1, 1978. Nor is this all. There is also this provision in the 
Order of respondent Inciong: "Manage足ment shall pay its employees their 
salaries from August 16-31, 1978, and thereafter."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup>
  There would be no unfairness involved therefore if in accordance with 
its terms, the obligation to make such payments which had long since 
accrued being honored. The law is thus clearly on the side of 
petitioner-union.
</p><p>
Even from the standpoint of the economics involved, the case for 
petitioner-union is particularly strong. The increases provided in such 
collective contract are rather minimal. For employees in the Greater 
Manila Area, the increase is P30.00 a month, plus longevity pay of P1.00
 for every year of service for 1972, P20.00 a month for 1973 and P20.00 a
 month for 1974; for employees in Class A and B Stations, P25.00 a month
 plus longevity pay of P1.00 for every year of service for 1972, P20.00 a
 month for 1973 and P20.00 a month for 1974; for employees in Class C 
and D Stations, P20.00 a month plus longevity pay of P1.00 for every 
year of service for 1972, P15.00 a month for 1973 and P15.00 a month for
 1974.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup>  The assailed order
 on its face shows how far respondent Inciong had been sympathetic to 
what respondent Company considered the difficulty inherent in its 
financial condition. The objections it had persistently raised renders 
it liable to the suspicion that there is lacking that modicum of good 
faith expected of every party to a contract. To demonstrate that such a 
misgiving is not well-founded, private respondent can do no less than 
abide by its explicit terms. What is more, to accept the posture of 
private respondent is to ignore what has been so long and so often 
stressed by this Court on the respect to be accorded the social justice 
mandate<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup>  and protec足tion to labor guarantee<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup>
  of the Constitution. No further delay in the implementation of such 
order can thus be tolerated. In this connection, it may not be amiss to 
state that as held in Free Telephone Workers Union v. Minister of Labor 
and Employment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>  even when
 the power of compulsory arbitration "allowable under the Constitution 
and quite understandable in labor disputes affected with a national 
interest"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>  is invoked, "to
 be free from the taint of unconsti足tutionality, [it] must be exercised 
in accordance with the constitutional mandate of protection to labor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup>
  It follows, therefore, that equally so, where the resort by the 
parties to settle a dispute is through voluntary arbitration, it becomes
 equally indubitable that there be fidelity to the fundamental 
principles that labor be protected and social justice be promoted.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the immediate implementation of the decision of Voluntary 
Arbitrator Froilan Bacungan is hereby ordered. This decision is 
immediately executory. Costs against private respondent.
