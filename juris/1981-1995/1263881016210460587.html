Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
stationed in <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span> which held that the principal
amount representing the legal services <span style="">of
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
had already been paid but that the interest thereon in the amount of P5,488.21
computed from June 1, 1959 had not been paid yet and the Resolution (pp 55-57, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) of the same court dated May 15, 1981 denying
the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">claim for </span>attorney’s
fees <span style="">was </span>filed by private
respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Justino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
in Special Proceedings No. 54 entitled, "Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intestate Estate <span style="">of </span>the spouses Pedro <span class="SpellE">Inaldo</span> and
Consuelo <span class="SpellE">Bariuan</span>." Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
acted as counsel of all the heirs of the deceased spouses, including the
administrators, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Inaldo</span> <span style="">and </span>Manuel <span class="SpellE">Inaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim alleged that his legal fees had <span style="">not </span>been settled for the last fifteen
(15) years since January <span style="">8, 1955 (p. 22,
</span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">) </span>by the heirs-administrators, Rodolfo
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Inaldo</span> and the estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 28, 1974, the court, then presided by Judge Jesus <span class="SpellE">Arlegui</span>, issued an Order fixing Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia's</span>
fees, the pertinent portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"The <span class="SpellE">movant</span> counsel's fees, however, is from <span style="">1955 </span><span style="">to </span>1963, inclusive (pp. 111-116, and 413-414, Record); when at
the latter year he ceased to render services, as appears on the record, or <span style="">8 </span>years of valuable and important legal
works and services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In working for
correction of accounting of the income and expenses of the administration of <span style="">the </span>estate, <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
counsel obtained a court order for balances to the guardianship of P411.67 and
to the estate <span style="">in </span>the sum of P31<span class="GramE">,532.67</span> for the period from <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1948</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1954" day="31" month="12">December

purchasing power <span style="">of </span>the peso
from 1959 has gone to a very low level, which is of judicial knowledge (Re <span class="SpellE">Pantoja</span>, 25 SCRA 460).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the legal service fees of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Justino</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>, whose legal fees remain unpaid, is hereby
fixed in the sum of P6<span class="GramE">,358.00</span> from <span style="">1955 </span>to 1963, inclusive, with legal
interest thereon at 6% from date <span style="">of </span>judicial

<p class="BODY">On June 17, 1974, the heirs-administrators filed a motion to
vacate the order of May 28, 1974; to re-open the claim of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> and to admit evidence to resist said claim for
attorney's fees on the following grounds:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) that neither the heirs-administrators nor their counsel received a
copy of the motion of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>; 2) that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia's</span> claim had already been paid; and 3) that granting
that the said claim had not been paid yet, the same had already prescribed (pp.
26-28, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1974">July 31, 1974</st1:date>,
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> filed an urgent motion for inscription
of attorney's lien in the titles of some properties of the estate on the ground
that the heirs had depleted the immovable properties of the estate and that
said heirs had not paid the attorney's fees awarded by the trial court on <st1:date month="5" day="28" year="1974">May 28, 1974</st1:date> (pp. 30-31, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="29" year="1974"><span style="">July </span>29, 1974</st1:date>, the trial

attorney's fees filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span> for lack of
merit and for failure of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> to appear at the
scheduled hearing of the motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
heirs-administrators filed an appeal from the denial of their motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June 4,
 1975</st1:date>, the heirs-administrators and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
entered into a compromise agreement regarding the latter's claim for attorney's
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties agreed that the award

(2/3), to be payable <span style="">in </span>two equal
<span style="letter-spacing: 0.2pt;">installments (pp. 38-39, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).
For their part, the </span>heirs-administrators’ would withdraw their appeal. The

<p class="BODY">The petition alleged that the order approving the compromise
agreement and the compromise agreement <span class="GramE">itself</span> never
made mention of any interest charges owing to private respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It alleged
further that since the said order had already become final, the trial court
acted without jurisdiction when it altered or amended the order by granting the

judgment cannot be modified or amended.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If an amendment is to be made, it may consist only of supplying <span style="">an </span>omission, or striking out a
superfluity or interpreting an ambiguous phrase therein in relation to the body
of the decision which gives it life [Republic v. CA, 41 SCRA 422 (1971);

<p class="BODY">The compromise agreement dated June 4, 1975 and the trial court's
order approving the agreement contained no specific provision regarding the
award of interests in addition to the award of 2/3 of the principal amount
granted by the court <span style="">in </span>its order
of May 28, 1974.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in resolving the motion for reconsideration of
its February 9, 1981 order held that:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As correctly pointed out by the claimant <span style="">in </span>this case, the order of <span style="">May </span>28, 1974 is still the controlling
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only amendment made in the
order of June 19, 1975 is as regards the principal amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, maintains that the same order
of May 28, 1974, ordering the payment of legal interest from the date of
judicial demand has not been done away <span style="">with
o</span>r amended by the order of June 19, 1975, because the said order of June
19, 1975 specifically states that 'the order this Court dated May 28, 1974 is
hereby amended and the Administrator is ordered to pay two thirds (2/3) of the
amount stated in said order <span style="">xx </span><span class="SpellE">xx</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the
order of May 28, 1974 mentions about interest, the order of June 19, 1975,
therefore, necessarily means that the interest is included in the 2/3 of the
amount to be given to the claimant in this case, <span style="">Atty. </span><span class="SpellE">Justino</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Vigilia</span>
(pp. 56-57, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, the acts of the parties subsequent to the execution of
the compromise agreement show that they intended <span style="">to </span>forego with the interest claims awarded in the May 28, 1974
Order of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, pursuant to the agreement, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Inaldo</span>
complied with his part of the deal by delivering to the private respondent the
amount of P2,119.33 on June 6, 1975, representing one-half of P4,238.67 the
reduced amount of that originally granted to private respondent in the May 28,
1974 Order of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An equal
amount was delivered to the private respondent three (3) months after on
September 8, 1975, again pursuant to the compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the amount of two-thirds of P6<span class="GramE">,358.00</span>
<span style="">plus </span>interest at 6% to be
computed from the date of the judicial demand (<st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1959</st1:date>), private respondent expected a total payment
of P8,053.43, computed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>2/3 x P6<span class="GramE">,358.00</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>=<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>P4,238.67</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If it were true, as claimed by him, that interests on the
principal amount was not excluded in the agreement, he should have objected to
the payment of the first installment of only P2<span class="GramE">,119.33</span>
which was not half of the amount he expected to receive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the compromise
agreement provided that petitioners' liabilities would be payable in <u>two</u>
<u>equal</u> <u>installments</u> <u>only</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the first installment delivered to him was short of what was
allegedly agreed upon by them, private respondent should have brought the
matter to the attention of the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he
interpose any objection when the second installment in the same amount was paid
to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The agreement itself equipped the private respondent with a
remedy in case of default or non-­compliance with any of its terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 5 thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of
this compromise agreement upon its signing shall be retroactive to this date
and <u><span style="">writ</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="">execution</span></u><span style=""> </span>shall
issue upon default of any of its terms <span style="">or
of </span>the order herein incorporated as integral portion hereof (p. 39, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Instead of availing of this remedy, the private respondent waited
for eight (8) months after the petitioners complied with their part of the
agreement before bringing an action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
silence for an unreasonable length of time after the payment to him of the last
installment payment revealed that as far as he was concerned, there was already
a full satisfaction of his claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while the May 28, 1974 order mentions about interests, the
failure of the compromise agreement to categorically provide <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> meant that it had been excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reference in the compromise agreement to
the amount stated in the <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1974</st1:date>
order of the court pertains to the amount specifically stated therein which <span class="GramE">was only the principal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the failure of private respondent to object or
protest to the amount of the installment payments delivered to him, revealed
that the parties actually agreed that only the reduced amount of the principal
stated in the May 28, 1974 order of the trial court would be paid to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from claiming otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent trial court gravely abused its discretion and
acted without jurisdiction when it granted the motion <span style="">of </span>private respondent for payment of his legal fees when there
had already been a complete and full satisfaction of the claim eight months
back.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Order of the trial court dated February
9, 1981 is SET ASIDE and the motion of the private respondent dated May 10,
1976 praying for payment of his legal fees is DENIED.</p>
