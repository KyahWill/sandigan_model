				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The merciless killing of a couple by three men who thereafter robbed
them of their earnings and valuable possessions is the focus of this
prosecution for robbery with double homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Amarillo and
Anita <span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span> were residents of San Felipe, San
Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> who were engaged in the business
of buy and sell of gold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1976</st1:date>, they were on their way
home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had in their possession about
P40,000.00 and some assorted jewelries and gold valued at about P1,740.00 in
cash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the money were bundled in
a piece of cloth and tucked at <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo’s</span> waist
while the other items were kept in a paper bag which was placed inside a red
bag.</p>

<p class="BODY">They were followed by Mateo Padilla, Boy <span class="SpellE">Batin</span>
and Benjamin Padilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, Mateo
hacked <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> with a bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> turned
around and hit Mateo with a cane but thereafter <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
fell to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mateo continued
hitting him on different parts of the body particularly on the right side of
his neck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing the bizarre attack
on her husband, Anita fled but <span class="SpellE">Batin</span> blocked her
way.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Batin</span> hit
her hands with his bolo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anita tried to
escape but <span class="SpellE">Batin</span> pursued her and hit her twice on the
back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She fell to the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the two were prostrate on the ground, Benjamin Padilla took
from <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo's</span> waist the piece of cloth containing
the money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at this juncture that
Mateo noticed the presence of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> who was
then by the roadside cutting <span class="SpellE"><u>talahib</u></span> who
witnessed the assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mateo instructed <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> to pick up one of the bags containing money belonging
to the <span class="SpellE">Amarillos</span> and to cover with sand the blood
scattered over the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doton</span> followed the instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was then ordered to go home with a warning
that he should not tell anyone about what he saw under pain of being
killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
hurriedly left for home bringing with him the red bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On his way home he met Wilson <span class="SpellE">Retura</span> with whom he exchanged pleasantries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before reaching home <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> found that
the red bag contained money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He took the
money in the bag and he threw the red bag in the river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then went to <span class="SpellE">Urdaneta</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and deposited the sum of P9,000.00 in his
bank account.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the amount of
money he took from the bag.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the multiple wounds suffered by the <span class="SpellE">Amarillos</span>
they died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anita <span class="SpellE">Galamgam</span>,
who sustained multiple wounds on various parts of the body, died due "to
severe hemorrhage particularly the incised wound at the back, base of the neck
with fracture of the spinal column severing the spinal cord and blood
vessels."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> Amarillo also sustained multiple wounds on the
neck, the skull and the head and the cause of his death was due to
"massive hemorrhage due to incised wound base of the neck, right side with
fracture of the spinal column severing the spinal cord and big blood vessel of
the neck."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
According to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Remedios</span> <span class="SpellE">Santilion</span>,
the rural health officer who autopsied the bodies of the victims, the wounds
inflicted were caused by sharp-edged instruments.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After due investigation by the police, an information charging
Mateo Padilla, Benjamin Padilla, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> and
Boy <span class="SpellE">Batin</span> of the crime of robbery with double
homicide was filed by the Assistant Provincial Fiscal, with the approval of the
Provincial Fiscal, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused Boy <span class="SpellE">Batin</span>
remained at large, while the others were arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment, said accused entered their
pleas of not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the start of the
trial, accused Francisco <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was discharged as a
government witness upon motion of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, a decision was rendered by the trial
court on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1979</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with these considerations, judgment is hereby
rendered finding the accused, Mateo Padilla and Benjamin Padilla, alias '<span class="SpellE">Conang</span>,' guilty beyond reasonable doubt of ROBBERY WITH
DOUBLE HOMICIDE as charged in the Information and are sentenced to each suffer
the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>; to

<blockquote>The bolo used by Mateo Padilla, (Exhibits

<p class="BODY">Mateo Padilla commenced serving his sentence and did not
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, only Benjamin Padilla
interposed this appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleges the
following errors on the part of the trial court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED
IN CONVICTING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT BENJAMIN PADILLA ON THE STRENGTH OF THE
TESTIMONY OF FRANCISCO DOTON, A CO-ACCUSED WHO WAS DISCHARGED AS A STATE
WITNESS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED
IN DISCREDITING THE TESTIMONY OF THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT AND HIS WITNESSES IN
THE LIGHT OF THE INCREDIBILITY AND GROSS INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TESTIMONIES OF
THE PROSECUTION WITNESS, FRANCISCO DOTON.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u>QUO</u> GRAVELY ERRED
IN FINDING THE DEFENDANT-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME
CHARGED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the credibility of state witness Francisco <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> is put into issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
should not have been discharged as he is not the least guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the evidence on hand, it appears that
the participation of <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> is that of a mere
accessory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, even if he may
be considered a co-principal by his presence during the incident and his
cooperation in the concealment of the fruits of the offense appears to be
indispensable, considering that he was not among those who inflicted the fatal
wounds that led to the death of the victims and that he did not take part in
the robbery the Court is convinced that he <u>not the most guilty</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is all that the rule requires of a
government witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
color:white"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is then argued that it is unnatural for <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
to be present during the incident and to have calmly witnessed the killing and
robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As asserted by <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>, his presence at the time was accidental inasmuch as
he was then cutting cogon grass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He must
have been hidden behind the <span class="SpellE"><u>talahib</u></span> bush so
much so that the appellants did not notice him earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when he was seen, he was threatened and
it was due to fear for his life that he obeyed the instructions that was given
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that the role of <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was not just of a mere innocent bystander but that of
a participant in the perpetration of the offense, he had lawfully been
discharged as a state witness and his testimony appears to be credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Benjamin Padilla alleges that he was implicated by <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> only after his father, Juan Padilla, informed the
police authorities about the loot deposited in his bank account in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> and that, accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
was motivated by revenge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was motivated by revenge, he should have implicated
Juan Padilla who made the revelation not appellant Benjamin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the sworn statement <span class="SpellE">Doton</span>
executed on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1979</st1:date>
before the police authorities of San Nicolas, he stated that Benjamin Padilla
took the piece of cloth around <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo's</span> waist.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, he identified appellant Benjamin Padilla even before Juan Padilla
informed the police about his bank deposit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also points out that the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> identifying Benjamin was not corroborated and that he
was not mentioned as a participant in the sworn statement of Mateo
Padilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sole testimony of a witness
if credible, is sufficient basis for conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mateo Padilla must have withheld Benjamin's
identity from the investigators as Benjamin is his nephew.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other alleged contradictions in the testimony of this witness are
indicated by appellant to show his unreliability but the said contradictions,
if at all, are on minor matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather
than affect his credibility, they are badges of truthfulness and candor.</p>

<p class="BODY">This view holds true for his earlier statement that he saw the three
accused following the victims on that afternoon and thereafter he said no body
else passed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He must be referring to
persons other than the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
when first asked by the police about the P9,000.00, he said it was part of his
wife's savings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, he admitted it
was his share in the loot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained
that he did not immediately reveal the source of the money for fear for his
life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, he opened up later
on.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another instance is when <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> was
asked if he knew Mateo Padilla and Benjamin Padilla, and he answered that he
only knew Mateo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later he said he knew
Benjamin only after the station commander pointed out Benjamin to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is noted that in the sworn statement <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> executed after he was picked up, he identified Mateo
Padilla but he was not able to give the names of the other two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, he also stated that he
could recognize them if he sees them again.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the station commander brought <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> to the
residence of appellant in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Flores, San
Manuel, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He identified the appellant as one of the culprits upon seeing him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of the appellant is alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the face of their positive identification
by <span class="SpellE">Doton</span> as the culprits, the alibi cannot
prevail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused Mateo Padilla said he
was at his home in San Felipe, San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>
at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 P.M.</st1:time> on the fateful day of <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the morning, he allegedly went to <span class="SpellE">Binalonan</span> to check on his army claims and dropped at his
sister's house at Flores, San Manuel, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant Benjamin Padilla claims that there
was a barrio fiesta at Flores, San Manuel, and that he had his son
"Banjo" baptized on that occasion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was allegedly at home the whole afternoon up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 P.M.</st1:time>, entertaining visitors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming their allegations are true, it is
still possible that appellant and his companions could have gone to the scene
of the crime at nearby <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Felipe to commit
the offense and thereafter return to their respective residences.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED
with the only modification that the indemnity for the death of the couple
should be raised to P30,000.00 each, with costs against appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
