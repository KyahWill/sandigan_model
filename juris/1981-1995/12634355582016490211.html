				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>On 18 June 1982, Jaime Canilang consulted Dr. Wilfredo B. Claudio
and was diagnosed as suffering from &quot;<u>sinus</u> <u>tachycardia</u>.&quot;
The doctor prescribed the following for him:  <u>Trazepam</u>, a tranquilizer; and <u>Aptin,</u> a beta-blocker
drug.  Mr. Canilang consulted the same
doctor again on 3 August 1982 and this time was found to have &quot;acute
bronchitis.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>On the next day, 4 August 1982, Jaime Canilang applied for a
&quot;non-medical&quot; insurance policy with respondent Great Pacific Life
Assurance Company (&quot;Great Pacific&quot;) naming his wife, petitioner
Thelma Canilang, as his beneficiary.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'

style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Jaime Canilang was issued ordinary life insurance Policy No. 345163, with the
face value of P19,700, effective as of 9 August 1982.</p>

<p class=BODY>On 5 August 1983, Jaime Canilang died of &quot;congestive heart
failure,&quot; &quot;anemia,&quot; and &quot;chronic anemia.&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner, widow and beneficiary of the insured, filed a claim with Great
Pacific which the insurer denied on 5 December 1983 upon the ground that the
insured had concealed material information from it.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner then filed a complaint against Great Pacific with the
Insurance Commission for recovery of the insurance proceeds.  During the hearing called by the Insurance
Commissioner, petitioner testified that she was not aware of any serious
illness suffered by her late husband<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3'
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and that, as far as she knew, her husband had died because of a kidney
disorder.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
A deposition given by Dr. Wilfredo Claudio was presented by petitioner.  There Dr. Claudio stated that he was the
family physician of the deceased Jaime Canilang<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5'
href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and that he had previously treated him for &quot;<u>sinus tachycardia</u>&quot;
and &quot;acute bronchitis.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Great Pacific for its part presented Dr. Esperanza Quismorio, a physician and a
medical underwriter working for Great Pacific.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7'
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
She testified that the deceased's insurance application had been approved on
the basis of his medical declaration.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8'
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
She explained that as a rule, medical examinations are required only in cases
where the applicant has indicated in his application for insurance coverage
that he has previously undergone medical consultation and hospitalization.<a

<p class=BODY>In a decision dated 5 November 1985, Insurance Commissioner
Armando Ansaldo ordered Great Pacific to pay P19,700.00 plus legal interest and
P2,000.00 as attorney's fees after holding that:</p>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

insure him;</blockquote>

<blockquote><![if !supportLists]>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><![endif]>Great Pacific had waived its right to inquire into the health

application;</blockquote>

</span><![endif]>Batas Pambansa Blg. 874 which voids an insurance contract,
whether or not concealment was intentionally made, was not applicable to
Canilang's case as that law became effective only on 1 June 1985.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>On appeal by Great Pacific, the Court of Appeals reversed and set
aside the decision of the Insurance Commissioner and dismissed Thelma
Canilang's complaint and Great Pacific's counterclaim.  The Court of Appeals found that the use of
the word &quot;<u>intentionally</u>&quot; by the Insurance Commissioner in
defining and resolving the issue agreed upon by the parties at pre-trial before
the Insurance Commissioner was not supported by the evidence; that the issue
agreed upon by the parties had been whether the deceased insured, Jaime
Canilang, made a <u>material</u> <u>concealment</u> as to the state of his
health at the time of the filing of insurance application, justifying
respondent's denial of the claim.  The
Court of Appeals also found that the failure of Jaime Canilang to disclose
previous medical consultation and treatment constituted material information
which should have been communicated to Great Pacific to enable the latter to
make proper inquiries.  The Court of
Appeals finally held that the <u>Ng Gan Zee</u> case which had involved <u>misrepresentation</u>
was not applicable in respect of the case at bar which involves <u>concealment</u>.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner Thelma Canilang is now before this Court on a Petition
for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;1.  x x x the Honorable Court of Appeals,
speaking with due respect, erred in not holding that the issue in the case
agreed upon between the parties before the Insurance Commission is whether or
not Jaime Canilang 'intentionally' made material concealment in stating his
state of health;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  x x x at any rate, the non-disclosure of
certain facts about his previous health conditions does not amount to fraud and
private respondent is deemed to have waived inquiry thereto.&quot;<a

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>We note that in addition to the negative
statements made by Mr. Canilang in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the medical declaration,
he failed to disclose in the appropriate space, under the caption
&quot;Exceptions,&quot; that he had twice consulted Dr. Wilfredo B. Claudio who
had found him to be suffering from &quot;<u>sinus tachycardia</u>&quot; and
&quot;acute bronchitis.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The relevant statutory provisions as they stood at the time Great
Pacific issued the contract of insurance and at the time Jaime Canilang died,
are set out in P.D. No. 1460, also known as the Insurance Code of 1978, which
went into effect on 11 June 1978.  These
provisions read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 26.  A neglect to
communicate that <u>which a party knows</u> and <u>ought to communicate</u>, is
called a concealment.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>  x x x<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 28.  Each party to a
contract of insurance must communicate to the other, in good faith, all factors
<u>within his knowledge</u> which are <u>material to the contract</u> and as to
which he makes no warranty, and which the other has not the means of
ascertaining.&quot; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Under the foregoing provisions, the
information concealed must be information which the concealing party knew and
&quot;ought to [have] communicate[d],&quot; that is to say, information which
was &quot;material to the contract.&quot; The test of materiality is contained
in Section 31 of the Insurance Code of 1978 which reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 31.  Materiality
is to be determined not by the event, but <u>solely</u> by the <u>probable and
reasonable influence of the facts upon the party to whom the communication is
due</u>, in forming his estimate of the disadvantages of the proposed contract,
or in making his inquiries.&quot; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>&quot;<u>Sinus tachycardia</u>&quot; is considered present
&quot;when the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute.&quot;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The symptoms of this condition include pounding in the chest and sometimes
faintness and weakness of the person affected.  The following elaboration was offered by Great Pacific and set out by
the Court of Appeals in its Decision:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;<u>Sinus tachycardia</u> is defined as sinus-initiated; heart
rate faster than 100 beats per minute.  (<u>Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine</u>, 8th ed. [1978], p.
1193.) <u>It is, among others, a common reaction to heart disease</u>,
including myocardial infarction, <u>and heart failure per se</u>.  (Henry J.L. Marriot, M.D., <u>Electrocardiography</u>,
6th ed. [1977], p. 127.) The medication prescribed by Dr. Claudio for treatment
of Canilang's ailment on June 18, 1982, indicates the condition that said
physician was trying to manage.  Thus,
he prescribed <u>Trazepam</u>, (<u>Philippine Index of Medical Specialties</u>
(PIMS), Vol. 14, No. 3, Dec. 1985, p. 112.) which is anti-anxiety,
anti-convulsant, muscle-relaxant; and <u>Aptin</u>, (<u>Idem</u>, p. 36) <u>a
cardiac drug, for palpitations and nervous heart</u>.  Such treatment could have been a very material information to the
insurer in determining the action to be taken on Canilang's application for
life insurance coverage.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14"
name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>We agree with the Court of Appeals that the information which
Jaime Canilang failed to disclose was material to the ability of Great Pacific
to estimate the probable risk he presented as a subject of life insurance.  Had Canilang disclosed his visits to his
doctor, the diagnosis made and the medicines prescribed by such doctor, in the
insurance application, it may be reasonably assumed that Great Pacific would
have made further inquiries and would have probably refused to issue a
non-medical insurance policy or, at the very least, required a higher premium
for the same coverage.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn15' href="#_ftn15"
name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The materiality of the information withheld by Great Pacific did not depend
upon the state of mind of Jaime Canilang.  A man's state of mind or subjective belief is not capable of proof in
our judicial process, except through proof of external acts or failure to act
from which inferences as to his subjective belief may be reasonably drawn.  Neither does materiality depend upon the
actual or physical events which ensue.  Materiality relates rather to the &quot;probable and reasonable
influence of the facts&quot; upon the party to whom the communication should
have been made, in assessing the risk involved in making or omitting to make further
inquiries and in accepting the application for insurance; that &quot;probable
and reasonable influence of the facts&quot; concealed must, of course, be
determined objectively, by the judge ultimately.</p>

<p class=BODY>The insurance Great Pacific applied for was a &quot;non-­medical&quot;
insurance policy.  In <u>Saturnino v.
Philippine-American Life Insurance Company</u>,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16'
href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;x x x if anything, the <u>waiver of medical  examination [in a non-medical insurance
contract]  renders even more material
the information required of the applicant concerning previous  condition of health and diseases suffered</u>,
for such information necessarily constitutes an important factor which the
insurer takes into consideration in deciding whether to issue the policy or not
x x x.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The Insurance Commissioner had also ruled that the failure of
Great Pacific to convey certain information to the insurer was not
&quot;intentional&quot; in nature, for the reason that Jaime Canilang believed
that he was suffering from minor ailment like a common cold.  Section 27 of the Insurance Code of 1978 as
it existed from 1974 up to 1985, that is, throughout the time range material
for present purposes, provided that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 27.  A
concealment entitles the injured party to rescind a contract of
insurance.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>The <u>preceding</u> statute, Act No.
2427, as it stood from 1914 up to 1974, had provided:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 26.  A
concealment, <u>whether intentional or unintentional</u>, entitles the injured
party to rescind a contract of insurance.&quot; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Upon the other hand, in 1985, the
Insurance Code of 1978 was amended by B.P. Blg. 874.  This <u>subsequent</u> statute modified Section 27 of the
Insurance Code of 1978 so as to read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Sec. 27.  A
concealment <u>whether intentional or unintentional</u> entitles the injured
party to rescind a contract of insurance.&quot; (Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The unspoken theory of the Insurance Commissioner appears to have
been that by deleting the phrase &quot;intentional or unintentional,&quot; the
Insurance Code of 1978 (prior to its amendment by B.P. Blg. 874) intended to
limit the kinds of concealment which generate a right to rescind on the part of
the injured party to &quot;intentional concealments.&quot; This argument is not
persuasive.  As a simple matter of
grammar, it may be noted that &quot;intentional&quot; and
&quot;unintentional&quot; cancel each other out.  The net result therefore of the phrase &quot;whether intentional
or unintentional&quot; is precisely <u>to leave unqualified</u> the term
&quot;concealment.&quot; Thus, Section 27 of the Insurance Code of 1978 is
properly read as referring to &quot;<u>any</u> concealment&quot; without regard
to whether such concealment is intentional or unintentional.  The phrase &quot;whether intentional or
unintentional&quot; was in fact superfluous.  The deletion of the phrase &quot;whether intentional or
unintentional&quot; could <u>not</u> have had the effect of imposing an
affirmative requirement that a concealment must be intentional if it is to
entitle the injured party to rescind a contract of insurance.  The restoration in 1985 by B.P. Blg. 874 of
the phrase &quot;whether intentional or unintentional&quot; merely underscored
the fact that all throughout (from 1914 to 1985), the statute did <u>not</u>
require proof that concealment must be &quot;intentional&quot; in order to
authorize rescission by the injured party.</p>

<p class=BODY>In any case, in the case at bar, the nature of the facts not
conveyed to the insurer was such that the failure to communicate <u>must have
been</u> intentional rather than merely inadvertent.  For Jaime Canilang could not have been unaware that his heart
beat would at times rise to high and alarming levels and that he had consulted
a doctor twice in the two (2) months before applying for non-medical
insurance.  Indeed, the last medical
consultation took place just the day before the insurance application was
filed.  In all probability, Jaime
Canilang went to visit his doctor precisely because of the discomfort and
concern brought about by his experiencing &quot;<u>sinus tachycardia</u>.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>We find it difficult to take seriously the argument that Great
Pacific had waived inquiry into the concealment by issuing the insurance policy
notwith­standing Canilang's failure to set out answers to some of the questions
in the insurance application.  Such
failure precisely constituted concealment on the part of Canilang.  Petitioner's argument, if accepted, would
obviously erase Section 27 from the Insurance Code of 1978.</p>

<p class=BODY>It remains only to note that the Court of Appeals finding that
the parties had <u>not</u> agreed in the pretrial before the Insurance
Commission that the relevant issue was whether or not Jaime Canilang had <u>intentionally</u>
concealed material information from the insurer, was supported by the evidence
of record, i.e., the Pre-trial Order itself dated 17 October 1984 and the
Minutes of the Pre-trial Conference dated 15 October 1984, which &quot;readily
shows that the word 'intentional' does not appear in the statement or
definition of the issue in the said Order and Minutes.&quot;<a
