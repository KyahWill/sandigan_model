1987 in NLRC Case No. 1966-LR-XI-86, entitled "Olga S. <span class="SpellE">Quiñanola</span>,
Complainant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> vs. Philippine Japan Active
Carbon Corporation and/or <span class="SpellE">Tokuichi</span> <span class="SpellE">Satofuka</span>, Respondents-Appellants,” affirming the decision
dated June 5, 1987 of the Labor Arbiter finding that the private respondent
Olga S. <span class="SpellE">Quiñanola</span> was illegally dismissed and
ordering the appellants to reinstate her with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, who had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">employed </span>in <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>
since <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1982</st1:date>, as
Assistant Secretary/Export Coordinator, was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">promoted on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">May 20, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> to the position of Executive Secretary to
the Executive Vice </span>President and General Manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">May </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">31, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>for no apparent reason at all and
without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">prior </span>notice to her, she
was transferred to the Production Department as Production Secretary, swapping
positions with Ester <span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the transfer did not amount to a
demotion because her salary and workload remained the same, she believed
otherwise so she rejected the assignment and filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter found, on
the basis of the evidence of both parties, that the transfer would amount to
constructive <span class="GramE">dismissal,</span> hence, her refusal to obey the
transfer order was justified (pp. 76-77, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter further observed that:</p>

<blockquote><i>"There was something perverse in the </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">way she </span>was dismissed from her
work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was dismissed for causes <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">that are unjustified, if not entirely non-existent,
and foisted on her </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;

</span>Accordingly, they should be assessed and required </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to pay complainant </span>the sum<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> of P25<span class="GramE">,000</span></span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">damages and P5,000 </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of his decision
reads as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon appeal to the NLRC, the Commission approved the Labor Arbiter's
decision but reduced to P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> the award of moral
damages and the attorney's fees to 10% of the judgment (pp. 207-208, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The employer filed a petition for review of that decision in this
Court alleging that:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The decisions of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Labor
</span>Arbiter and of the NL<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">RC </span>are
tainted with grave abuse of discretion in finding that the private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was constructively and illegally dismissed as
a result of her transfer or assignment to the Office of the Production Manager
even if she would have received the same salary, rank, rights and privileges;</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. In ordering her reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and </span>without <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">loss </span>of seniority rights and other
benefits;</p>

<p class="NUM">3. In awarding to the private respondent moral damages of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> and attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the judgment;

respondent forfeited all her benefits for having abandoned her job on <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="6">June 2 to 3, 1986</st1:date> and for
insubordination.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her comment to the petition, the private respondent argued
that sh<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">e </span>was dismissed without
due process because she was not given the opportunity to be heard concerning
the causes of her transfer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a careful consideration of the petition and the documents
annexed thereto as well as private respondent's comment, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find the petition to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">A constructive discharge is defined as:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"A quitting because continued employment
is rendered impossible, unreasonable or unlikely; as, an offer involving a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>demotion in rank and a diminution in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">pay."

29, 1971.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the private respondent's assignment as Production
Secretary of the Production Department was not unreasonable as it did not
involve a demotion in rank (her rank was still that of a department secretary)
nor a change in her place of work (the office is in the same building), nor a
diminution in pay, benefits, and privileges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It did not constitute a constructive <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">dismissal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is the employer's </span>prerogative,
based on its assessment and perception of its employees’ qualifications,
aptitudes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and </span>competence, to
move them around <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">various areas </span>of its business
operations in order to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ascertain where </span>they
will function with maximum benefit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the
</span>company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employee's right to
security <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of tenure </span>does not give
him such a vested right <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in his </span>position
as would deprive the company of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">its
prerogative to change his </span>assignment or transfer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">him </span>where he will be most useful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his
transfer is </span>not unreasonable, nor inconvenient, nor <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">prejudicial to </span>him, and it does not
involve a demotion in rank or a diminution of his salaries, benefits, and other
privileges, the employee may not complain that it amounts to a constructive
dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, we reject the petitioner's contention that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the private </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">respondent's </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">absence </span>from
work on June 2 to <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1986</st1:date>
constituted an abandonment of her job <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
</span>the company resulting in the forfeiture of the benefits due her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While she was guilty of insubordination <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">for having </span>refused to move out of her
position <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as Executive </span>Secretary <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to the Executive Vice-President and General </span>Manager
of the company, dismissal from the service would be a draconian punishment for
it, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as her</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> complaint for illegal dismissal was filed in
good </span>faith.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the NLRC insofar as it orders
the petitioner to reinstate the private respondent is affirmed, but she shall
be reinstated to her position as Production Secretary of the Production
Department of petitioner’s corporation without loss of seniority rights and
other privileges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The awards of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, moral damages and attorney's fees to the private
