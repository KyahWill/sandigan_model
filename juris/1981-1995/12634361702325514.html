				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For Priscilla de Jesus, the events of the morning of March 30,
1989 were as a nightmare from which she could not seem to wake up.  A 45-year-old businesswoman from Cotabato
City, Priscilla had been staying for more than two months as a guest in the
residence of Daisy Ronquillo<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> in
Calzada, Camalig, Albay, when at 6:00 o'clock in the morning of March 30, 1989,
she was awakened by a short scream and a muffled sound, much like the opening
of a bottle of wine.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> She
immediately got up from her bed and ran out of the room towards the adjacent
kitchen.  There, she saw her friend,
Daisy Ronquillo, sprawled on the floor with blood oozing from her head.</p>

<p class="BODY">Priscilla noticed two men, one holding a gun and the other, a
knife.  The man with a gun went to
Daisy's room while the other went to her room.  Priscilla tried to revive her friend, grabbing the nearest rag to
staunch the flow of blood from Daisy's head.  Her efforts proved futile.  After
a few seconds, the two men came back and the one with the gun, identified by
Priscilla during the trial as Efren Nimo, poked it at her nape and demanded
that she give them a gun.  Priscilla
replied that she did not know anything about a gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the two men searched the rooms once again.  While they were busy looking for a gun,
Priscilla stood up.  As she was about to
run to the half-open kitchen door to escape, the man holding the knife saw
her.  He tied both of her hands with an
electric stove cord and gagged her mouth with a rag.  He tried to drag her into the sala but failed to do so as Daisy's
lifeless body was obstructing the way.  The man with the knife then went back to her room and ransacked her cabinet.</p>

<p class="BODY">With her left hand, Priscilla was able to loosen the cord tying
her hands.  She got up, ran out of the
house toward the hedges and started screaming.  The nearest neighbor, Elan, opened her window and so Priscilla ran to
her and asked her to call the police.</p>

<p class="BODY">Priscilla then asked Zoe Longasa, Daisy's cousin, to accompany
her back to Daisy's house, all the while thinking that Daisy was still
alive.  However, when they saw her,
Daisy's face was turning black.  Seeing
that nothing more could be done to help Daisy, they left and went to the house
of Antonina Mape, an aunt of Daisy, whose house was across the road.  There, they waited for the police who
arrived twenty to thirty minutes later.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the police asked Priscilla what happened, she told them that
two men had been to Daisy's house and the latter had been shot.  Priscilla also discovered that some of her
belongings were missing:   a diamond ring
worth P20,000.00, three (3) wrist watches valued at P7,000.00; two (2) antique
pendants worth P15,000.00, two (2) pairs of earrings worth P1,000.00, three (3)
pieces of gold necklace worth P3,000.00, one (1) ring and earring set worth
P1,200.00, a bracelet worth P350.00, several small pendants and one white
necklace.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At just about the time when the incident occurred, Sunny
Obligacion was grazing cows near the trail to the market in Calzada.  He heard the gunshot from out of
nowhere.  Then he saw Jessie Nipas
running towards the house of one Morco which was situated just in front of the
house of Daisy.  Seconds later, Sunny
saw Priscilla coming from Daisy's house shouting for help.  All this time, Sunny was just about forty
meters away from Daisy's house.  Soon
thereafter, people began to converge outside Daisy's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The gory crime generated wide publicity.  A columnist in <span style="">a </span>national newspaper even severely criticized the government,
specifically the police of Albay, for the occurrence of the felony.  In due time, the matter was brought to the
attention of President Corazon C. Aquino who forthwith directed the Director of
the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to take a hand in the investigation
of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An NBI team composed of Attys. Arlis E. Vela and Romulo Asis was
sent by NBI Director Antonio Carpio to Legazpi City to gather information about
the incident.  As a result of their
investigation, the NBI agents were able to arrest Efren Nimo at the corner of
Taft Avenue and EDSA in Pasay City on May 5, 1989.  After a check with their records, the NBI agents also discovered
that an outstanding warrant had been issued for Nimo's arrest in connection
with another murder case.  Hence, Nimo
was detained for finger-printing and further investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before interrogating Nimo, the NBI agents informed him of his
constitutional rights, such as his right to remain silent, his right against
self-incrimination and his right to counsel.  He accepted the NBI's offer of the services of Atty. Jesus Delfin who
happened to be at the NBI office at the time.  Thus, the investigation, which was conducted in Tagalog, a dialect known
to Nimo, culminated in the execution of Nimo's sworn statement, reproduced
below, but only after Nimo had conferred with Atty. Delfin.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

aking kasamahan na si JESSIE at nag-pangagaw sila sa kutsilyo.  Natumba silang dalawa at napailalim si
JESSIE.  Noong ako ay lalapit tumayo
siya at sinasalubong ako ngunit ang hawak kong baril ay pumutok at bumulagta
siya.  Tumuloy ako sa kuwarto at hinanap

<p class="BODY">After Nimo's arrest, the gun, a .38 caliber "paltik"
revolver was recovered by the NBI agents.  Nimo himself had told them that it was in his friend's house in Sto.
Ni√±o, Pasay City where he was temporarily staying.  Nimo then accompanied the NBI agents to the one-room abode of
Neri Mendiola, a security guard.  Upon
arriving there, they were met by a woman who turned out to be Neri Mendiola's
wife.  After she told them that Neri
Mendiola was still at work, the NBI agents told her that Nimo wanted to give them
the gun.  So, she allowed them to enter
the house.  When the NBI agents asked
Nimo where he kept the gun, he pointed to a small traveling bag.  Upon the agents request, Mrs. Mendiola got
the bag and handed it to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">They then asked Nimo to open the bag but it was locked.  Nimo told them that he did not have a key to
open the bag.  Mrs. Mendiola suggested
that since her husband had a key, they should all take the bag to Neri Mendiola
at his workplace.  They went to Neri who
gave them the key.  When Mrs. Mendiola
opened the bag, they found the gun inside.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, on July 11, 1989, an information for robbery with

taken from his cell inside the NBI building and brought to the office of
Assistant Director Salvador Ranin.  The
latter told him that a lawyer by the name of Atty. Jesus Delfin wanted to help
him.  Atty. Delfin told him to sign a

charged.  The dispositive portion of the
decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the highest interest of justice as the scales
of justice tilt heavily in favor of the prosecution beyond any shadow of doubt,
judgment is hereby rendered finding accused Efren Nimo y Nodalo of the crime of
Robbery with Homicide, as charged and he is hereby sentenced to suffer the
penalty of thirty (30) years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.  He shall also indemnify the heirs of Daisy
Ronquillo in the sum of thirty thousand (P30,000.00) pesos and return to
Priscilla de Jesus y Ortuoste all the articles mentioned under item 1 to 7 of the
information or, in case of the impossibility to do so, their equivalent values
in the total aggregate sum of fifty two thousand, five hundred and fifty
(P52,550.00) pesos <span style="">all</span> in
Philippine currency - and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Efren Nimo shall be given full credit for his detention pursuant to
Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exh. 'B,' the .38 caliber paltic, is ordered confiscated and
forfeited in favor of the Government and immediately turned over, under
receipt, to the Commanding Officer, Albay PC Command at Camp Bagong Ibalon,
Legazpi City, for proper disposition in accordance with Art. 45 of the Revised
Penal Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">With </span>respect to
accused Jessie Nipas, send the records to the archive without prejudice to the
revival of the case upon apprehension of said accused, for which purpose let an
alias warrant for his arrest issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Efren Nimo now comes to this Court on appeal contending that the
trial court erred in:   (a) finding that
Exh. B, the .38 caliber "paltik" revolver, was his own and was the same
gun used in killing Daisy Ronquillo, (b) finding that Priscilla de Jesus had
positively identified him as the killer of Daisy Ronquillo, (c) admitting his
extrajudicial confession which was taken by the NBI agents, and (d) convicting
him although his guilt had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar as the .38 caliber "paltik" revolver is
concerned, we find that indeed the trial court committed a reversible error in
giving it weight in assessing the prosecution evidence.  The gun had not been properly identified and
documented.  In fact, NBI agent Arlis E.
Vela himself admitted in open court that the gun surrendered to them by the
appellant on May 5, 1989, was never subjected to a ballistic examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither did Vela list down the serial number of the gun.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It should be noted, however, that presentation in evidence of the firearm used
in killing Daisy Ronquillo is not indispensable to prove the appellant's guilt,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
there being other proofs of his culpability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's contention, he was positively identified
by Priscilla de Jesus as one of the intruders who killed her friend.  On the stand, Priscilla unflinchingly
pointed to appellant as the killer of her friend, Daisy.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, impugns such positive identification by
referring to Priscilla's April 25, 1989 sworn statement before the NBI where
she stated that she was "not sure" whether she could recognize the
culprits.  On cross-examination,
Priscilla had testified:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.  Now, on that occasion, April 25, 1989 you
stated before the NBI Investigator that you did not recognize the men who
barged into your house, am I correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I remember I told them I
am not sure.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>In
fact you are not sure about the identity of those persons because you said that
one of them had a bonnet on his face?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not say that.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x  x  x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x  x  x.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q.  </span><span style="">Now, </span>I
am showing to you a xerox copy of the statement you gave before the NBI Office,
NCR Manila, is this the xerox copy of that statement?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q.  </span>Now, what made
you say that when you were questioned, 'Q - Do you know those two guys x x x Do
you know the reason why they killed Daisy Ronquillo?' your answer was 'No,
sir', what made you say so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The way I understand the question they were
my acquaintance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>  And when the question was asked of you, 'can
you recognize them if you could see them again?' and your answer was 'I am not
sure.'<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>  What do you mean?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.  Because I was still recuperating from shock of the tragedy.  The incident happened March 30, 1989 and I
was investigated April 25, 1989, nearly three weeks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.  Now, when you were asked to identify who was the man who poked a gun at
your nape you pointed to the accused Efren Nimo, am I correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>  But you could not be sure that he was the
one who poked that gun at you the morning of March 30, 1989?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  I was not sure.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>  Why are you sure now?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  I have fully recovered from the shock,
sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Far from demolishing the prosecution's evidence on the
identification of the appellant, said testimony erased any lingering doubt that
Priscilla had indeed positively identified him.  Human memory may be temporarily paralyzed by a startling event,
especially if the same involves a person close to the witness.  Eventually, however, as the witness recovers
from the trauma, memory regains its clarity.  This explains the experience of Priscilla.  Awakened rudely by a scream and the muffled gunshot, she rose to
find her friend bloody and sprawled on the kitchen floor.  When first confronted with the culprit at
the NBI office, her memory balked, most probably from the effects of her
horrifying experience.  However, at the
trial, composed as she had become, she unhesitatingly pinpointed Nimo as the
killer of Daisy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with a direct accusation, however, appellant never even
attempted to prove that Priscilla was motivated by ill-feelings as to falsely
impute to him the commission of such a serious crime.  There is also the established fact that Priscilla, aside from a
fleeting glance of the appellant, got a close look at him four times more
during the incident.  Worth quoting is
the portion of her testimony wherein Priscilla showed how she remembered
appellant:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
when you saw Efren Nimo on March 30, 1989 that was the only time you saw him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the running of the
events of that morning, March 30, 1989 was very fast, am I correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you find difficulty
in identifying him because of the fast phase (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir, because he kept
coming back to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How many times did Efren
Nimo go back to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four times.  The longest was when he poked the gun at me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he poked his gun he
was behind you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was that the fourth time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first time, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When was the second time
he went back to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he asked for the
gun.  He was asking for a gun and he was
asking the same question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he was asking that
he was not in front of you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At my side.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You did not have any
frontal view of the accused whom you said was asking for three times the gun
from you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I had sir because he was
staying in the sala."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Testimony in print is no substitute for the actual proceedings in
the trial court.  Hence, time and again,
this Court has ruled that appellate courts will not disturb the factual
findings of the trial court with respect to the credibility of witnesses and
their testimonies.  Having the advantage
of observing the demeanor of the witnesses as they testified, the trial court's
findings command great respect and consideration by the appellate courts,
especially if they are supported by the evidence on record.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of proof of misapprehension of facts, this Court can do no less
than give weight to the trial court's stamp of credibility on Priscilla as a
witness and on her testimony positively identifying appellant as the killer of
Daisy Ronquillo.  Such positive
identification of Nimo as the culprit completely demolished his alibi.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the prosecution had only one eyewitness hardly affects its
cause.  There is no law which requires
that the testimony of a single witness needs corroboration except when the law
expressly mandates such corroboration.  Witnesses are to be weighed, not numbered.  If credible and positive, the testimony of a single witness is
sufficient to convict.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To bolster his allegation that his extrajudicial confession was
inadmissible, appellant recited a litany of alleged acts of maltreatment from
the NBI agents.  As with the trial
court, this Court cannot give credence to such allegation.  For one thing, no medical certificate had
been shown to prove that he did suffer inhuman treatment.  Nor was there any proof that he even
initiated the filing of an administrative or criminal complaint against his
alleged tormentors.  Neither did
appellant present any eyewitness to his torture.  In short, his allegation, obviously self serving, hardly deserves
consideration.  It bears emphasis that a
case is built, block by block, not out of unsubstantiated allegation but on
what has been proved.  Thus unsupported,
appellant's allegation of maltreatment remains what it is, that is, a mere
allegation, and nothing more.</p>

<p class="BODY">Extrajudicial confessions, especially those which are adverse to
the declarant's interests, are presumed voluntary, and in the absence of
conclusive evidence showing that the declarant's consent in executing the same
has been vitiated, such confession shall be upheld.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, the allegation that the extrajudicial confession is inadmissible
is belied by these facts:   (1) appellant
was assisted by counsel who later signed his sworn statement; and (2) before
appellant made his extrajudicial confession, he was first asked if he was
amenable to the services of counsel, which query he answered affirmatively.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While we are morally convinced about the appellant's culpability,
we are not in agreement with the trial court that he should be held liable for
the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The original criminal design of a perpetrator of the special
complex crime defined in Art. 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code must be
robbery.  The homicide is perpetrated
with a view to the consummation of the robbery, whether by reason, or on the
occasion of, the robbery.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the intent to rob had been proven, not only
by the extrajudicial confession of appellant, but also by the testimony of
Priscilla that the two intruders kept on asking her for the gun which they
coveted.  No such gun was taken from the
house of Daisy Ronquillo, but Priscilla lost pieces of jewelry.  On this point, however, we entertain serious
doubts as to who took the jewelry.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the actual act of asportation by either or both of the
accused has not been proven by the prosecution, the records not disclosing any
evidence to this effect.  Thus, in her
detailed testimony, Priscilla never once mentioned that she actually saw either
Nimo or Nipas or both of them carrying away anything from the house, much less
her jewelry.  What is clear from the
records is that the intruders rummaged through the personal belongings of both
the victim and Priscilla in their effort to find the gun which they believed
was located somewhere in the house.  It
was not even shown that they were successful in their attempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is very disturbing is the fact that after realizing that her
friend was beyond revival, Priscilla left the victim's house and stayed at a
neighbor's house for approximately thirty (30) minutes while she awaited the
arrival of the police.  During this
period of time, a number of people had converged around the house of the
victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, quite probable that any of these spectators could have taken
advantage of the situation, entered the victim's house and appropriated for himself
Priscilla's jewelry.  That Nimo and
Nipas did not take any jewelry from the victim's house is further shown by
Nimo's sworn statement admitting the shooting of Daisy while vehemently denying
having stolen anything from the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>v.</u> <u><span style="">Pacala</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>wherein the accused were also charged
with the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, the Court considered
the following factors in determining the robbery aspect of the case:   (1) that there were no eyewitnesses to the
alleged robbery, and (2) that none of the things allegedly stolen was ever
recovered.  These considerations equally
apply to the case at bar, since no one actually saw either Nimo or Nipas take
jewelry from Priscilla's room; nor was even a piece of jewelry recovered from
Nimo.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the failure of the prosecution to prove beyond
reasonable doubt the element of robbery in the charge, appellant must be held
liable only for homicide.  In the <u><span style="">Pacala</span></u><span style=""> </span>case aforecited, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is well-settled that in order to sustain a conviction for
robbery with homicide, it is necessary that the robbery itself be proven as
conclusively as any other essential element of the crime.  In order for the crime of robbery with
homicide to exist, it is necessary that it be clearly established that a
robbery has actually taken place, and that, as a consequence or on the occasion
of such robbery, a homicide be committed.  Where the evidence does not conclusively prove the robbery, the killing
of the victim would, therefore, be classified either as a simple homicide or
murder, depending upon the absence or presence of any qualifying circumstance
and not the complex offense of robbery with homicide.‚Äù<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As the <span style="">killing </span>was
not qualified by any of the circumstances enumerated in Art. 248 of the Revised
Penal Code which would classify the felonious act as murder, Nimo should be
held responsible for homicide.  The
aggravating circumstance of dwelling which was proven at the trial to have
attended the commission of the crime, should have been appreciated by the trial
court as an aggravating circumstance.  Since the homicide was attended by one aggravating circumstance, the
imposable penalty should be the maximum period of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">There being no proof that appellant has been convicted of any of
the crimes enumerated in Sec. 2 of the Indeterminate Sentence Law so as to
disqualify him from the beneficial effects of the said law, Nimo should suffer
the indeterminate sentence of ten (10) years and one (1) day of <u>prision</u> <u>mayor</u>
maximum as minimum period to twenty (20) years of <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>
maximum as maximum period.  Conformably
with recent jurisprudence, he shall indemnify the heirs of Daisy Ronquillo in
the amount of fifty thousand (P50,000.00) pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, appellant Efren Nimo is hereby declared guilty
