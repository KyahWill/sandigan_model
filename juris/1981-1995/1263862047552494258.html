issued by respondent Judge Vicente P. <span class="SpellE">Sibulo</span> of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span> City, 5th Judicial
Region, Branch IV respectively, ordering the issuance of a writ of execution,
and the cancellation of TCT Nos. 60085 and 60086 and the reinstatement of the

<p class="BODY">As factual background, it should be stated that the instant

the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group, the act of an individual included
in any of the three groups being deemed to be the act of the group.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two cadastral lots situated in <span class="SpellE">Daraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> used to be covered by Original Certificates of Title
Nos. RO-15434 (17622) and RO-15435 (2270) in the names of
predecessors-in-interest of the <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> Group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1971, upon a petition filed in the
cadastral case, the <span class="SpellE">OCTs</span> were cancelled, and replaced
by Transfer Certificates of Title Nos. T-29762 and T-29763 in the name of the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group, based on the finding that the
predecessors-in-interest of the <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> Group had
previously sold the two lots to the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span>
Group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group sold the two <span class="SpellE">Iots</span> to

T-30744 and T-30746.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 18, 1972, the <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> Group
filed before the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>

</span>Named defendants were the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group and the
Spouses <span class="SpellE">Maturgo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span> Group alleged in their complaint
that there was fraud committed by the <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group
when the latter had the <span class="SpellE">OCTs</span> cancelled, and <span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> issued in their name; and that there was fraud also in
the transfer of the two lots to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Maturgo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, the trial court ruled that (a) the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Maturgo</span> were purchasers in good faith, such that they could
retain their titles to the two lots; and (b) that the <span class="SpellE">Llorente</span>
Group was unlawfully divested of their ownership <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span> Group appealed to the Court
