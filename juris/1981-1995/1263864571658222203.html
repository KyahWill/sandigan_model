				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At bottom, the only issue in this case is whether a school that,
after due notice to the Secretary of Education, Culture and Sports, closed at
the end of the first semester of the school year 1987-1988, because its
teachers and students declared a strike, refusing to hold classes and take
examinations, may be forced to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reopen
by the courts at the instance of the striking students.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Some fourteen (14) years
ago, the petitioner Capitol Medical Center, Inc. (or CMCI), a hospital
corporation, organized, opened, and operated the Capitol Medical Center College
(CMCC or "the College") beside its hospital, the Capitol Medical
Center (hereafter "the Hospital") in Quezon City.  It offered a four-year nursing course, a
two-year midwifery course, and a two-year medical secretarial course.  In the first semester of the school year
1987-88, 900 students were enrolled in various courses in the college.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Halfway through the first
semester in 1987, the college faculty, led by the Dean of Nursing, demanded
that they be granted vacation and sick leave privileges similar to those
enjoyed by hospital personnel.  Dialogues
were held but no agreement was reached between the faculty and the school
administration, headed by the </span>president, Dr. Thelma Navarette-Clemente,
who was concurrently also the chairman of the CMCI Board.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At a meeting of the CMCI
Board on September 15, 1987, Dr. Clemente reported the deteriorating
relationship between the CMCC administration and the teachers, which, from a
simple disagreement, had degenerated into open hostility.  She feared that the situation may give </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rise </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">mass </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">action by the
students, because the faculty, exercising their moral influence over the
students, had enlisted the latter's sympathy </span>and support for their
cause.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Board resolved to
authorize her, as president of the College, to close it at the end of the first
semester if the antagonism of the faculty and students toward the college
administration should become uncontrollable.  The minutes <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>that
meeting of the CMC Board disclose the following action taken by the Board:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"<u>CMC</u> <u>College</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"The chairman reported on the developing antagonism between
the Dean and a good number </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the
Faculty on the one hand, and the CMC Administration on the other hand on
economic matters, more particularly the demand of the faculty for similar
vacation and sick leave privileges as hospital personnel, and that despite of
dialogs (sic), the faculty does not show any conformity to the difference.  She fears that this antagonisms</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> might later on develop into mass actions and
demonstrations, wherein students who are under the influence of the dean and
the faculty will show by concrete manifestation sympathy for the faculty
demands.<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"After a thorough discussion of the possible effect of
these mass demonstrations especially if done in front of hospital premises, on
patients confined in the hospital, and the possibility of this antagonism being
manifested during the making of the rounds of patients by CMCC Nursing Students
when being conducted </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Related
Learning Experiences (RLE), the board unanimously approved the following
resolution:<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Res.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No. </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">College, to close the
college at the end of the first semester, should the antagonism described by
her become uncontrollable." (p. 79, Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">During the next thirty
(30) days, the rift between the administration and the faculty aggravated.  The school administration scheduled the
holding of the final semestral examinations on October 14 to 19, 1987, but the
teachers defiantly and unilaterally "postponed" </span>them.  On the scheduled dates for the examinations,
the students joined their teachers in a noisy demonstration in front of the
hospital (Annexes O, P, Q, and R, pp. 146-147, Rollo).  As the demonstrations disturbed the peace
and quiet of the hospital and fearful of possible subversive action by hostile
student nurses which might endanger the safety and lives of the patients in the
hospital, an emergency special meeting was held by the CMCI Board on October
17, 1987.  It unanimously resolved
"to close the school effective at the end of the first semester of this
school year, 1987-88" (p. 269, Rollo).  Starting on that date, the following announcement was posted in several
places on the school premises:</p>

<blockquote><i>"The decision as embodied in the
corporate resolution contemplates in no uncertain terms the <u>immediate</u> <u>and</u>

cogent reasons:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“1. Mismanagement
of the school administration and mishandling of corporate policies by the Dean,
extending down to the lower administrative levels.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“2. Failure of the
school to produce the quality of education that maybe reasonably expected or
desired as evidenced by the poor quality of Instruction it gives, the deficient
program of guidance it maintains, and the poor performance of its graduates
over the past few years.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“3. The increasing costs of operation
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">maintenance </span>of school
facilities.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“4. Considering
the fact that the school is only a minor subsidiary of the hospital
corporation, its </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">continued </span>operation
and dependent existence will as projected, greatly impair the economic
viability of the institution and ultimately affect health care delivery and
other vital medical services of the hospital to the community and the general
public.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

there are no legal impediments against the <u>immediate</u> <u>and</u> <u>complete</u>

an injunction prior to the final hearing (Manila Electric Railroad and Light
Co. vs. Del Rosario, 22 Phil. 433).  It
may, however, issue "in cases of extreme urgency; where the right is very
clear; where considerations of relative inconvenience bear strongly in
complainant's favor; where there is a willful and unlawful invasion of
plaintiff's right against his protest and remonstrance, the injury being a
continuing one; and where the effect of the mandatory injunction is rather to
reestablish and maintain a preexisting continuing relation between the parties,
recently and arbitrarily interrupted by the defendant, than to establish a new
relation.  Indeed, the writ should not
be denied the complainant when he makes out a clear case, free from doubt and
dispute." (Commissioner of Customs vs. Cloribel, et al., 19 SCRA 235.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

their chosen courses) created </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeals
presumably, but erroneously, relied on paragraph 137, Sec. IV of the Manual of
Regulations for Private Schools; which provides:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"Every student has the right to enroll in any school,
college or university upon meeting its specific requirements and reasonable
regulations, provided, that except in the case of academic delinquency and
violation of disciplinary regulations, the student is presumed to be qualified
for enrollment for the entire period he is expected to complete his course
without prejudice to his right to transfer."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The meaning of this
provision is that the school, after having accepted a student for enrollment in
a given course may not expel him or refuse to re-enroll him until he completes
his course, except when he is academically deficient or has violated the rules
of discipline.  He is presumed to be
qualified to study there for the entire period it will take to complete his course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">However, there is no
contract between him </span>and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">school
for the latter to remain open for the entire duration of his course.  Section VII, </span>paragraph <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No. 137, of the Manual of Regulations for

<blockquote><i>"137.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>When a student registers in a school, it is
understood that he is enrolling for the entire school year for elementary and
secondary courses, and for <u>the</u> <u>entire</u> <u>semester</u> <u>for</u> <u>collegiate</u>
<u>course</u>.  </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">A </span>student, who transfers or otherwise
withdraws, in writing, within two weeks after the beginning of classes and who

length of time longer than one month may be charged ten per cent of the total
amount due for the term if he withdraws within the first week of classes, or
twenty per cent if within the second week of classes, regardless of whether or
not he has actually attended classes.  The student may be charged all the school fees in full if he withdraws
anytime after the second week of classes.  However, if the transfer or withdrawal is due to a justifiable reason,
the student shall be charged the pertinent fees only up to and including the
last month of attendance."</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The contract between the college and a
student who is enrolled and pays the fees for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>semester, is for the entire semester only, not for the entire
course.  The law does not require <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>school <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>see a student <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">through
</span>to the completion of his course.  If the school closes or is closed by proper authority at the end of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>semester, the student has no cause
of action for breach of contract against the school.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus did this Court rule in “Alcuaz, et <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">al. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs. </span>Philippine
School of Business Administration, Quezon City Branch, et al.," G.R. No.
76353, promulgated on May 2, 1988, a case which involved some students and
teachers who had participated in mass actions and rallies in the respondent
school and who were respectively denied re-admission for enrollment, and re?appointment
to teaching positions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>the
school:</p>

<blockquote><i>"It is beyond dispute that a student once admitted by the
school is considered enrolled for one semester.  It is provided in Paragraph 137 Manual of Regulations for Private
Schools, that when a college student registers in </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">a </span>school, it is understood that he is
enrolling for the entire semester.  Likewise, it is provided in the Manual, that the 'written contracts'
required for college teachers </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>for ‘one semester.’ It is thus evident
that after the close of the first semester, the PSBA-QC no longer has any
existing contract either with the students or with the intervening
teachers.  Such being the case, the
charge of denial of due process is untenable.  It is a time-honored principle that contracts are respected as the law between
the contracting parties (Henson vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., G.R.
No. 72456, February 19, 1987, citing:  Castro <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vs. </span>Court of
Appeals, 99 SCRA 722; Escano vs. Court of Appeals, 100 SCRA 197).  The contract having been terminated, there
is no more contract to speak of.  The
school cannot be compelled to enter into another contract with said students
and teachers.  ‘The courts, be they the
original trial court or the appellate court, have no power to make contracts
for the parties.’ (Henson vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., </i><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">." </span>(p. 12 of the decision.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Significantly, in <u>Alcuaz</u>
only <u>some</u> students and teachers left their classrooms to hold rallies in
the school premises.  The majority
remained in the classrooms.  The school
did not cease to operate.  In this case,
however, <u>all</u> the teachers and students struck and abandoned their
classes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In <u>Alcuaz</u>, the
mass assemblies and barricades were held for three days.  In the CMCC case, the "strike"
began on October 14 and continued until the end of the semester.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In <u>Alcuaz</u>, the
school did not close but it nevertheless refused to re-admit the offending
students and teachers.  In this case,
the school has closed completely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If in <u>Alcuaz</u>, this
Court recognized the right of the school to refuse admission to students guilty
of breaches </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">discipline, and of the peace, its right to
close when the entire faculty and student population </span>have boycotted
their classes, may not be denied.  The
irony for the school in this case is that it was forced to close by student
action, and is now being forced to reopen by student action also, assisted by
the lower court.  We cannot sanction the
order of the lower court which gave aid and comfort to the students who
paralyzed the operation of the school by their mass actions forcing it to shut
down altogether.  We cannot approve a
situation which would place a school at the mercy of its students.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, hold that the lower court gravely abused its
discretion in compelling the CMCC to reopen and re-admit the striking students
for enrollment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the second
semester of their courses.  Since their
contracts with the school were terminated at the end of the first semester of
1987, and as the school has already ceased to operate, they have no "clear
legal right" to re-enroll and the school has no legal obligation to reopen
and re-admit them.  No provision in the
Education Act of 1982, nor in the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools can
be, or has been, cited to support the novel view that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>school is obligated to remain open until its students have
completed their courses therein.  Indeed, neither is there a law or rule that obligates a student who has
enrolled in a school, to remain there until he finishes his course.  On the contrary he may transfer at<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> any time </span>to any school that is
willing to accept him.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if it can be supposed that the enrollment of a student
creates an implied "binding contract" with the school to educate him
for the entire course, since a contract creates reciprocal rights and
obligations, the obligation of the school to educate a student would imply a
corresponding obligation on the part of the student to study and obey the rules
and regulations of the school.  When
students breach that supposed contract by refusing to attend their classes,
preferring to take to the streets to mount a noisy demonstration <u>against</u>
their school, the latter may cancel the contract and close its doors.  Its action would neither be arbitrary nor
unfair.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was the trial court that acted arbitrarily or with grave abuse
of discretion in ordering the school to reopen and re-admit the striking
students and teachers in spite of their refusal to desist from continuing their
disruptive mass actions against the school.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">granted.  </span>The decision dated May 15, 1988 of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. SP No. 13626 is hereby set aside.  The order and writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued by the

<p class="BODY">I concur, but with the following reservation I made in the <span class="SpellE">Alcuaz</span> Case:</p>

<blockquote>I also have my misgivings about the ruling of the Court that a
student's enrollment is from semester to semester and may be terminated at will
by the school after each period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I
submit that when a student is enrolled for a particular course, the implicit
understanding is that he is entitled to remain in the school until he
graduates, subject only to the usual academic, financial and other reasonable
requirements.</blockquote>
