				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> treats of a
decision of the National Labor Relations Commission dated April 7, 1986,
declaring illegal the dismissal of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> from
employment by the Commercial Motors Corporation (hereafter, simply CMC), and directing
<span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>' reinstatement to his former position without
loss of seniority rights and benefits with full back wages computed from the
time of dismissal on November 16, 1983 until actually reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY">CMC is engaged in the sale, marketing and distribution of
Mercedes Benz vehicles and spare parts, as well as in the servicing, repair and
maintenance of said vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
branches in various parts of the country, including one in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> had been working with CMC since May,
1973, first as Spare Parts Checker at the Manila Office; later, as
Warehouse-in-Charge in the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch; and still
later, Spare Parts Supervisor in the same Branch.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in September, 1983, <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> was
required by his superiors to attend a seminar at the Manila Office, to be held
from September 24, to <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before leaving, and on instructions of Nestor
Santos, the Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch, <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> gave the keys of the warehouse to <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>, the Spare Parts Counter Salesman.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently Branch Manager Nestor Santos learned afterwards of
some irregularities in the Spare Parts Department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After preliminary verification, he asked <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> to make an initial listing of missing parts, at the
same time reporting the matter to the Head Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> failed to
submit any list, so <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> called
him and asked him directly about the reportedly missing spare parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
instructed <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> to make a report directly to the
Manila Office, which the latter did, on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1983</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1983</st1:date>,
an audit team from the Manila Office arrived in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city> and proceeded to conduct an
audit and physical inventory of spare parts in the Branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Branch Manager Santos received information
that <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> not only refused to cooperate with the
audit team, as instructed, but attempted to delay, disrupt and confuse the
auditors.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>

<p class="BODY">The audit team discovered that spare parts were indeed missing or
otherwise unaccounted for with a total value of P244,825.59.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This finding was set out in an Affidavit of
Loss executed on <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1983</st1:date>

<blockquote>2) to confirm his suspicion, <span class="SpellE">Morandante</span>
made a check of spare parts in the warehouse the following day and then and

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1983</st1:date>,

Branch Manager Nestor Santos about the missing spare parts; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2) on or about October 17, 1983, after <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>
had talked privately with <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span> in the spare parts
office, <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> had instructed him (<span class="SpellE">Morandante</span>)
to break the back door so as to give the impression that burglars had broken
into the building and taken the missing spare parts, but <span class="SpellE">Morandante</span>
had refused to do so.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1983</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> was served with a notice of preventive
suspension and termination of his services, to take effect on <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1983</st1:date> on grounds of
serious misconduct and dishonesty in the performance of duties, and fraud and <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> breach and/or loss of trust as Branch Spare Parts

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1983</st1:date>,
CMC filed a criminal complaint with the Office of the Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City charging <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span>, and a certain <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> Yap
with qualified theft and violation of the Anti-Fencing Law (PD 1612).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The preliminary investigation resulted in the
dropping of all the charges against <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> on the
ground of insufficiency of evidence, on the one hand and the filing of
corresponding indictments against <span class="SpellE">Lacaba</span> and <st1:place>Yap</st1:place>,
on the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The dismissal of the accusations against <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> was
sustained after a reinvestigation undertaken at CMC's instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A petition by CMC to have the resolutions of
dismissal reviewed by the Ministry of Justice was rejected because filed out of
time.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 3, 1984, <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span> filed with
the Regional Arbitration Branch at <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City a
complaint against CMC for illegal dismissal, illegal suspension, and for
recovery of back wages and damages.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After due proceedings, the Labor Arbiter found that he had been legally
and properly dismissed from employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Arbiter thus dismissed <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>' complaint
but directed the payment to him of "his 13th month pay (P1,715.00) and
service incentive leave pay (P522.80)" in the total amount of P2,237.80.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal seasonably taken by <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>,
however, the National Labor Relations Commission (Second Division) reversed the
judgment of the Arbiter insofar as the latter had ruled <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>'
separation legal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission's
decision rendered on <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1986</st1:date>
contained the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, respondent is hereby
ordered to immediately reinstate complainant to his former position without
loss of seniority rights and benefits, with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
computed form the time he was illegally terminated/suspended on <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1983</st1:date> until actually
reinstated.<span style="font-size: 12pt; text-transform: uppercase;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The claim for moral and exemplary damages ** (is) denied for want
of proof and arguments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Except as herein MODIFIED, the appealed Decision is affirmed in all
other dispositions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the action at bar CMC would have this Court annul the NLRC
decision of April 7, 1986, contending that the NLRC had gravely abused its
discretion when it reversed the Labor Arbiter's judgment "merely because
the criminal charges filed against ** (<span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>) were
dropped by the Office of the City Fiscal."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Commission's reversal of the Arbiter's decision was not in truth grounded
on the dismissal by the public prosecutor of the criminal charges <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by CMC against <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was primarily premised on the failure of
CMC to establish by adequate evidence its avowed ground for the termination of <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>' services:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>loss of confidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More
specifically, like the City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, the
Commission found the evidence given by <span class="SpellE">Morandante</span>, on
which the Labor Arbiter appears to have relied quite heavily, to be unworthy of
credit in the light of all the attendant circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, there is no gainsaying that loss of confidence is a
recognized ground for the discharge of an employee from employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such a ground must be founded from facts
established by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
the burden of establishing such facts as reasonably cause loss of confidence in
an employee -- such facts as reasonably generate belief by the employer that
the employee is connected with some misconduct and the nature of his
participation therein is such as to render him unworthy of the trust and
confidence demanded of his position -- is on the employer.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the employee has been absolved in a criminal prosecution
involving said misconduct does not preclude the employer from attempting to
prove the same before the labor arbiter or the latter from accepting that
evidence as sufficient foundation for a finding of lawful termination of
employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, the employer's
evidence, although not required to be of such degree as is required in criminal
cases, i.e., proof beyond reasonable doubt, must be substantial, must clearly
and convincingly establish the facts upon which loss of confidence in the
employee may fairly be made to rest.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC analyzed the employer's proofs and came to the reasoned
conclusion that they did not adequately demonstrate <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>'
connection with the loss of spare parts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner tries hard to convince the Court of the faultiness of the
Commission's appreciation of the proofs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question, however, is not whether the Commission erred in its
assessment of the evidence, but whether that error, if error it be, was one
that may be characterized as whimsical, capricious, or arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever other things may be said about the
Commission's disputed assessment of the evidence, it cannot be said to have
been done whimsically, capriciously, or arbitrarily, a proposition that must
necessarily cause dismissal of the action at bar, for failure of the petitioner
to satisfactorily show any grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction on the part of the respondent Commission, as required by
Rule 65 of the Rules of Court on which said petitioner's plea for review is
founded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows, moreover, that <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>'
separation from employment was effected without according him due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not given notice of the charges
against him and an opportunity to be heard thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pronouncement by the NLRC of the
illegality of <span class="SpellE">Umlas's</span> dismissal must thus be
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem, however, that the circumstances of this case
render inappropriate <span class="SpellE">Umlas</span>' reinstatement to his
former position, as an item of relief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
more equitable disposition is that which this Court has more than once made in
other cases of the same nature:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
award, in lieu of reinstatement, of separation pay at the rate of one month's
salary for every year of service, "so that ** (the employee) can be spared
the agony of having to work anew with ** (the employer) under an atmosphere of
antipathy and antagonism, and the ** (latter) does not have to endure the
continued service of ** (the former) in whom it has lost confidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision of the National Labor Relations
Commission dated April 7, 1986 in NLRC Case No. 1356-LR-Xl-84 is AFFIRMED as
regards its basic findings and conclusions, but MODIFIED as to its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part in that the requirement for the
