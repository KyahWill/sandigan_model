				<BR><STRONG>VITUG, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Questioned in this appeal instituted by petitioner Philippine National
Bank is the decision, dated 05 May 1987, of the appellate court, which has
reversed the decision of the then Court of First Instance ("CFI" and
now Regional Trial Court) of Isabela, Branch 5, Echague, by ruling in favor of
private respondent Filemon Remigio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts, by and large, are undisputed.  In chronology, the events leading to this
appeal may be recited, thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(1) On 25 August 1967, private respondent obtained from petitioner
a P65,000.00 loan secured by a real estate mortgage covering five (5) parcels
of land in Isabela described in and embraced by Transfer Certificates of Title
("TCT") No. T-11326, T-681, T­-100, and T-27 and Original Certificate
of Title No. I-­1673.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Private respondent defaulted; hence, on 17 November 1970,
petitioner bank extrajudicially foreclosed on the mortgage, and it acquired the
encumbered assets for the sum of P87,082.00.  The sheriff's sale was registered with the Office of the Register of
Deeds of Isabela only on 11 October 1972.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) In its letter-offer of 15 February 1971, petitioner bank
invited private respondent to repurchase the foreclosed property for P87,082.00
plus <span style="">interest </span>and other
charges.  Before that, or on 18 November
1970 (or one day after the foreclosure sale), private respondent already had paid
an initial P10,000.00 to redeem the property.  Subsequently, additional payments were made by private respondent, i.e.,
P10,000.00 on 26 April 1971 and another P20,000.00 on 17 May 1971.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) On 21 October 1972, Presidential Decree ("P.D.") No.
27 was enacted into law that mandated an agrarian reform.  Pursuant thereto, an "Operation Land
Transfer Program" was launched; among the areas it covered were the
parcels of land under TCT No. T-100, T-11326 and T-681.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5) On 17 April 1974, private respondent offered to buy the
foreclosed property for P284,000.00 which was the market and appraised value
thereof fixed by petitioner bank.  On 24
December 1974, the Deed of <u>Promise</u> <u><span style="">to</span></u><span style=""> <u>Sell</u> </span>was
executed between petitioner bank and private respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) In a letter, dated 25 August 1978, sent to and received by
petitioner bank on even date, private respondent, through counsel, inquired why
he <span style="">was </span>still being made to buy
the property for P284,000.00 when, in truth, he had already paid P40,000.00 of
the P87,082.00 previously offered by petitioner for the redemption of the
property.  There was no reply or
response from petitioner.  <span style="">As </span>of 02 November 1977, private
respondent had paid petitioner the total sum of P207,243.85, itemized, as
follows:</blockquote>

this Decision subject to the provisions of P.D. No. 27 and in accordance with
the mechanics of the Operation Land Transfer; and, annulling the order of the

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review on <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition cannot be
sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When Presidential Decree
No. 27, "Decreeing the Emancipation of Tenants from the Bondage of the
Soil, Transferring to them the Ownership of the Land They Till and Providing
the Instruments and Mechanism therefor," was enacted on 21 October 1972,
the parcels of land in dispute were clearly still subject to private
respondent's right of redemption.  In
the foreclosure of real property by banking institutions, as well as in the
extrajudicial foreclosure by any </span>other mortgagee, the mortgagor could
redeem the property within one year from date of registration of the deed of
sale in the appropriate Registry of Deeds (Santos vs. Register of Deeds of
Manila, 38 SCRA 42; Reyes vs. Noblejas, 21 SCRA 1027).  In Medida vs. Court of Appeals (208 SCRA
887), we ruled that the "title to the land sold under a mortgage
foreclosure remains with the mortgagor or his grantee until the expiration of
the redemption period x x x." The Court of Appeals committed no error when
it thereby held:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x.  The foreclosure
proceedings were instituted in 1970, and on this, there appears to be no
question.  The registration of the
sheriff's sale was, however, effected only on October 11, 1972.  From this date, therefore, the period of
redemption begins to run since, according to judicial construction, the period
of redemption begins to run not from the date of the sale but from the date of
registration of the sale in the office of the Register of Deeds, applying this
rule not only to an execution sale but also to an extrajudicial foreclosure
sale of registered land (Salazar vs. Meneses, 118 Phil. 512; Reyes vs. Noblejas
and Santos, 65 O.G. 21, May 26, 1969; Santos vs. RFC, 101 Phil. 980; Reyes vs.
Tolentino, G.R. NO. L­-29142, Nov. 29, 1971) as required under Section 27 of
Rule 39 of the Rules of Court in relation to Section 50 of Act No. 496.  For this reason, the foreclosure proceedings
were not completed since the period of redemption, counted from October 11,
1972, would expire on October 12, 1973.  This would thereby bring the disputed properties under the operation and
under the ambit of the said Opinion which interprets Operation Land Transfer
under P.D. No. 27.  x x x.”  (Rollo, pp. 87-88.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It was not thus all that consequential
for the appellate court to still rule on the efficacy or inefficacy of the
foreclosure.</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing, the Secretary of the Department of Justice has himself
opined thus:</p>

<blockquote>"I am aware that a ruling that lands covered by P.D. No. 27
may not be the object of the foreclosure proceedings after the promulgation of
said decree on October 21, 1972, would concede that P.D. No. 27 had the effect
of impairing the obligation of the duly executed mortgage contracts affecting
said lands.  There is no question,
however, that the land reform program of the government as accelerated under
P.D. NO. 27 and mandated by the Constitution itself (Art. XIV, Sec. 12), was
undertaken in the exercise of the police power of the state.  It is settled in a long line of decisions of
the Supreme Court that the Constitutional guaranty of non-impairment of
obligations of contract is limited by the exercise of the police power of the
state (citations omitted).  One
limitation on the contract clause arises from the police power, the reason
being that public welfare is superior to private rights (citation
omitted).  The situation here, is like
that in eminent domain proceedings, where the state expropriates private
property for public use, and the only condition to be complied with is the
payment of just compensation.  Technically, the condemnation proceedings do not impair the contract to
destroy its obligations, but merely appropriate or take for public use
(citation omitted).  As the Land Bank is
obliged to settle the obligations secured by the mortgage, the mortgagee is not
left without any compensation." (Opinion No. 92, Series of 1978; Rollo,
pp. 88-89.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The opinion deserves respect (42 Am. Jur.
p. 421; Cagayan Valley Enterprises, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 179 SCRA 218;
Ramon Salaria vs. Hon. Carlos R. Buenviaje, et al., 81 SCRA 722).  This Court, likewise, in a number of cases
has expressed the <u>dictum</u> that police power subordinates the non-impairment
clause of the Constitution (Ortigas &amp; Co. Ltd. Partnership vs. Feati Bank
and Trust Co., 94 SCRA 533; Kabiling vs. National Housing Authority, 156 SCRA
623; Anglo-Fil Trading Corporation vs. Lazaro, 124 SCRA 494).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals has erred in
holding that the bank is entitled only to P87,012.00, and not to P284,000.00,
which it considers to be the fair market value of the property foreclosed.  Here, the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>

<blockquote>"We come to the respective liabilities and obligations of the
parties.  To date, the defendant bank
has received P207,243.85 from the plaintiff (Stipulation of Facts, No.
15).  In addition, the defendant bank
has also been the recipient of bonds worth P160,000.00 and cash in the amount of
P26,348.12 from the Land Bank in payment for the properties covered by TCTs
Nos. T-100, T-11326 and T-681 or a total amount of P186,348.12.  The defendant bank has accepted payment of
the latter amount at P170,348.12.  All
in all, the bank has received payments in cash and bonds in the amount of
P377,591.97 as compensation for the plaintiff's original obligation of
P65,000.00.  The total amounts paid by
plaintiff represent the consideration in part of the market price of the
properties as found by the Loans and Discount Section of the defendant bank
irrespective of whether or not the lands are covered by Operation Land
Transfer.  The cash and bonds payments
made by the Land Bank to the PNB on the other hand, represent payments for the
lands covered by Operation Land Transfer, namely T-­100, T-11326 and
T-681.  For its part, the lower court
ruled that the plaintiff's obligation to the defendant bank amounts to
P186,874.16 based on the market price as determined by the Loans and Discount
Section of the defendant bank which market price amounts to P284,000.00.  In view of Our conclusion that the subject
mortgaged properties fall under the ambit and purview of Operation Land
Transfer under P.D. No. 27, it appears that said adjudged amount is in excess
of the rightful amount that is due the defendant bank by the plaintiff.  We hold, therefore, that the defendant bank
is entitled to a payment of P87,012.00 representing the offer of the defendant
bank to the plaintiff in the same bank's letter to the plaintiff dated February
15, 1971.  The plaintiff is, therefore,
entitled to a refund of whatever over payments were made by him in favor of the
defendant bank.  The amount of
P87,012.00 represents the redemption price of the foreclosed properties and as
a release of the said properties for redistribution to qualified tenants."
(pp. 89-90, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In Development Bank of the Philippines vs. Mirang, 66 SCRA 141,
we have ruled that the right of redemption by the mortgagor could be exercised
by paying to the creditor bank all the amounts owing to the latter "on the
date of the sale, with interest on the total indebtedness at the rate agreed
upon in the obligation from said date." In the case of foreclosures by the
Philippine National Bank particularly, Section 20 of its own charter provides:</p>

<blockquote>""SEC. 20.  <i>Right
of Redemption of property foreclosed</i>.  - The mortgagor shall have the right, within the year after the sale of
real estate as a result of the foreclosure of a mortgage, to redeem the
property by paying the amount fixed by the court in the order of execution,
with interest thereon at the rate specified in the mortgage, and all the costs
and other judicial expenses incurred by the Bank by reason of the execution and
sale and for the custody of said property." (Republic Act No. 1300).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Accordingly,
