<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">An </span>information</span>
was filed charging <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>
with murder <span style="">committed as follows:</span></p>

about March 5, 1982, in the municipality of <span class="SpellE">Leganes</span>,
province of Iloilo, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the above named
accused, taking advantage of the nighttime, armed with ho<span style="">m</span>emade shotgun (<span class="SpellE">pugakhang</span>)

provided, thereby inflicting upon <span style="">the
latter </span>gunshot wounds on the vital parts of his body which <span style="">caused </span>his death thereafter."
(Orig. Records, p. 1)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On arraignment, the accused entered a plea of not guilty through
counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial proceeded with the prosecution presenting evidence on the
following facts as attending the <span style="">commission
of the crime:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1982</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span>,
Jr. met <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>,
Jr. at the <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Leganes</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He invited <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
for a drink of one bottle of beer at the public market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> acceded
(pp. 14-15, 19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="11"><span style="">Nov. 19, </span>1984</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“While <span class="SpellE">Espiridion</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
were drinking beer, appellant <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span> went inside the place where the two were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> invited <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> to have a drink with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> refused the
invitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
then placed his arm around the shoulder of <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>
but the latter brushed aside the <span class="SpellE">former’s</span> arm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Afterward,
(sic) </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> attempted to shake hand with <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> at the same time telling him to forget what
happened in the past between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> evaded the hand of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
and left the place without saying anything (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> left, <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> continued
with their drinking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that instance, <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> what
happened between him and <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> replied
that he and <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> had a fist fight two days ago in
which <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> was at the receiving end until somebody
came to pacify them (pp. 17-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After about thirty minutes <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> decided to go to the town plaza where
there was <span style="">a </span>fair and stayed there
for about one hour twenty minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From
the plaza, they proceeded to the house of Elvira <span class="SpellE">Galo</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leganes</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Iloilo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They met <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cesama</span> in said house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While they were there, Elvira served them with beer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="45" hour="19">7:45
 o'clock</st1:time> that night, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> entered the
house of Elvira as if looking for somebody.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> again invited <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>
to drink but the latter declined the offer and left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About thirty minutes later, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> again went inside the house of Elvira also as if
looking for somebody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about two
minutes, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> left (pp. 5, 21-24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, ibid)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moments later, <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> asked
permission from <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> to urinate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> followed
<span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> toward the <span class="SpellE">footwalk</span>
near a banana plant at the back of the kitchen of said house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> was
about four and half arms length from <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> who was
urinating, he saw <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> pointing something at <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Almost at
the same time, <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> whispered to <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> and a gunshot rang out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> turned
around and collapsed with blood oozing from his right clavicle and with his
private part still visible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> forthwith went to help <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span>
by <span class="SpellE">craddling</span> him (pp. 6-8, 26-30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, Thelma <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span> who was then looking for her son <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span>, passed by said place and saw <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> still holding a gun with his right hand (pp. 7-8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="11">November 12,
 1984</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>
then ran toward the road going to the house of Ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Jagunap</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> pursued <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> stayed for about three minutes outside the house
of the Ex-Mayor waiting for <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> to come out. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> left when
he saw <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> with a companion proceeding toward the
<span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> (pp. 10-11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid; pp. 9-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1984" day="12" month="11">Nov. 12, 1984</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> and <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>
brought <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Tito <span class="SpellE">Doromal</span>
conducted an autopsy on the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> and

located on his right upper chest.’<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"A",

(<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief, pp. 3-7)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense on the other hand, presented the following version
supporting the accused-appellant's plea of not guilty:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In his defense, accused testified that he was with his father
attending to their farm the whole day of <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="3">March
 5, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped working
only at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time> to comply
with his father's bidding to buy viand at the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did buy the viand as instructed but asked
a cousin, Wilson <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>, to bring said viand to their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then proceeded to the
irrigation to see if there was water and later decided to go to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along the
way, he met <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Abao</span>
and while both of them were passing by the house of ex-mayor <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagunap</span>, the latter,
who was at the gate of his house, engaged them in a conversation and thereafter
invited them inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A certain
Dante <span class="SpellE">Guinalon</span> was with them in the conversation
outside the mayor's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He too was
invited by the mayor inside <span style="">the </span>house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While inside the mayor's house, he watched
television until <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 p.m.</st1:time> when he
decided to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He arrived home at
about <st1:time minute="30" hour="9">9:30</st1:time> and the following morning,
he was informed by his father that <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>, Jr. was shot at the cockpit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="3">March
 8, 1982</st1:date>, he proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
where he was then employed with General Milling Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1) returning only on <st1:date year="1984" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1984</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> claim that he worked in
the farm the whole day of <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1982</st1:date>
or up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time> of that day is
corroborated by his father, Roman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
other allegation that he was at the ex-mayor's house from <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 p.m.</st1:time> to <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 p.m.</st1:time>
is corroborated by the ex-mayor himself, <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Jagunap</span> and by Dante <span class="SpellE">Guinalon</span>."
(Record, pp. 417- 420)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence presented, the trial court rendered
a decision convicting the accused as charged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision is now the <span class="GramE">subject</span> of this
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Octavio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of murder as defined and penalized under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code,
the qualifying circumstance of treachery having been present in the commission
of the crime, but without any modifying circumstances, and hereby sentences him
to reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> with <span style="">all </span>the accessory penalties provided by law, to indemnify the
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>,
Jr. the sum of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) Philippine currency as
compensatory damages for the latter's death, to pay the sum of P12,344 as
funeral and burial expenses, P3,000 as actual expenses, P5,000 as moral
damages, P10,000 representing legal fees and the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>
should be credited in full for the period of his preventive imprisonment,
should there be any, if he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the
disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners, otherwise, four fifths
(4/5) thereof." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 420-421)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the trial court, the
accused-appellant raises two issues for our determination, namely:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN
UNDULY RELYING ON THE TESTIMONY OF PROSECUTION WITNESS ESPERIDION DAPITAS, JR.,
NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT DID NOT HEAR THE TESTIMONY OF SAID WITNESS BUT ALSO BECAUSE
OF THE INHERENT INCREDIBILITY OF THE SAID WITNESS AND THE IMPROBABILITY OF HIS
TESTIMONY.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN FINDING THAT THERE WAS POSITIVE
IDENTIFICATION OF THE ACCUSED AND THAT THE DEFENSE OF ALIBI CANNOT PREVAIL OVER
THE SAME." (Appellant's Brief, pp. 43-44)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a thorough examination of the records of the case, we hold
that there is no reversible error in the trial court's relying on the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the Judge who decided the case was not the one who heard
the witnesses testify does not weaken the finding that the evidence is <span style="">conclusive of the guilt of the
accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>, G.R. No. 80885, May 17, 1990 we stated that "xxx
the mere fact that Judge Alfredo C. Flores did not preside at the trial of this
case in its entirety, having taken over only when the last defense witness was
to be presented did not detract from the validity, much less the correctness of
this decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The full record was
available to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is evident from the
knowledgeable and analytical decision he has written that he thoroughly
examined the testimonial and documentary evidence before him and carefully
assessed the credibility of the witnesses with the seasoned perceptiveness he
has developed as a trial judge." The appellant has not shown any
convincing reasons why</span> the same rule should not apply in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not an unusual practice for a Judge who did not try the
case to decide it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a few cases have
been decided by Judges who did not conduct the trial in its entirety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weighing of the evidence of a case is not
confined to testimonial evidence; it includes the totality of the evidence
presented by both the prosecution and the defense, both testimonial and
documentary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant raises the improbability of the testimonies
of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanga</span> claims that Thelma <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span>
did not actually see him shoot <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, he states that, according to her
testimony, there were eight (8) other persons near her who were one arm's
length away from her and where she in turn was 5 arm's length away from <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assails
the fact that not one among those eight (8) persons was presented as witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing irregular about this.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span>is up to the
parties to determine for themselves whether it is necessary to present
corroborating evidence or to rely alone <span style="">on
</span>its principal evidence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Zabala</span>, 86
Phil. 251 [1950]; People v. Salazar, 58 SCRA 468 [1974]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact remains that the accused was positively identified by
Thelma <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span> as the person with a gun immediately
after <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> was shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She heard a sho<span style="">t</span> and immediately after, she saw <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>
with a gun in his right hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
able to recognize him because of the reflection of light from the nearby
houses.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important, however, was the presence of eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span>, Jr. during
the shooting incident and who testified as to its details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> was only
three arms length from the victim when he saw the accused-appellant shoot <span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> Jr. with <span style="">the home-made shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presence of <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span>
was not rebutted by <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>questioning <span class="SpellE">Esperidion's</span> positively identifying him as the assailant,
the appellant points to some <span style="">alleged
inconsistencies in his testimonies such as </span>that <span class="SpellE">Esperidition</span>
testified that he saw and met Pat. <span class="GramE">Kwan at the incident <u>before</u>
he ran after <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was later contradicted he claims, by a
later testimony of <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> that he saw Pat. Kwan <u>after</u>
he ran after <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever may be the seeming inconsistency, it is <span class="SpellE">reconciliable</span> by the fact that <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span>
was consistent in testifying that he met Pat. Kwan only when he returned from
the body of <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> after pursuing the appellant up
to the house of <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span>, the ex-mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">other
alleged contradictions are even more inconsequential and easily explained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We apply the well-settled rule that minor
inconsistencies will not </span>affect the credibility of witnesses (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacala</span>, 58 SCRA 370, [1974]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>,
58 SCRA 742 [1974])</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Juanga's</span> defense of alibi, although
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Jagunap</span> and <span class="SpellE">Guinalon</span>
is unavailing as against his positive identification by the prosecution
witnesses and the absence of physical impossibility of his being at the scene
of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house of ex-Mayor <span class="SpellE">Jagunap</span> where he claims he was at the time of the incident
is only 400 meters away from the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi, thus, cannot prevail (People v.
Garcia, 141 SCRA 336 [1986]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Parilla</span>, 144
SCRA 454, [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses whose integrity is being questioned by
the accused have no motive to falsely testify against the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is the appellant who had
a motive to kill <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As related by the victim to prosecution <span style="">witness <span class="SpellE">Esperidion</span> <span class="SpellE">Dapitas</span>, </span>Jr., <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span> and <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span> had an earlier fist fight where <span class="SpellE">Juanga</span> was bested.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This angered the accused to the point that the victim's reconciliatory
moves were pointedly ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that motive in the instant case does not have to be
proved considering the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses of
the accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the fist
fight, the brushing off of the attempts to reconcile, and the appellant's sizing
up the situation immediately before the shooting add to the correctness of the
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is an established
jurisprudential rule that as between the positive declaration of the
prosecution witnesses and the negative denials of the accused, the former
deserves more credence (People v. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span>, et al.,
G.R. No. 88662, June 18, 1990 citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Macabenta</span>,
170 SCRA 298, [1989]; People v. de Jesus, 145 SCRA 521, [1986]; People v.
Plaza, et al. 140 SCRA 277, [1985]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, we hold that the crime committed was murder qualified by
<span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>, the accused having shot the victim
from behind without warning (People v. Acosta, G.R. No. 70133, July 2,
1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is shown by the suddenness
of the attack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People
