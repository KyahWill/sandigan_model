				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The employer has absolute discretion in hiring his employees in
accordance with his standards of competence and probity.  This is his prerogative.  Once hired, however, the employees are
entitled to the protection of the law even during the probation period and more
so after they have become members of the regular force.  The employer does not have the same freedom
in the hiring of his employees <span style="">as </span>in
their dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elena Honasan applied for employment with the Holiday Inn and was
on April 15, 1991, accepted for "on-the-job <span style="">training" as a telephone
operator for a period of three </span>weeks.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> For
her services, she received food and <span style="">transportation allowance.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On May
13, 1992, after completing her training, she was employed on a
"probationary basis" for a period of </span><span style="">six </span><span style="">months
ending November 12, </span><span style="">1991.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Her employment contract stipulated that the Hotel could terminate
her probationary employment at any time prior to the expiration of the
six-month period in the event of her failure (a) to learn or progress in her job;
(b) to faithfully observe and comply with the hotel rules and the instructions
and orders of her superiors; or (c) to perform her duties according to hotel
standards.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 8, 1991, four days before the expiration of the
stipulated deadline, Holiday Inn notified her of her dismissal, on the ground
that her performance had not come up to the standards of the Hotel.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Through counsel, Honasan filed a complaint for illegal dismissal,
claiming that she was already <span style="">a </span>regular employee at the time of her separation and so was
entitled to full security of tenure.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
complaint was dismissed on April 22, 1992 by the Labor Arbiter,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
who held that her separation was justified under Article 281 of the Labor Code
providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Probationary employment shall not exceed <span style="">six </span>(6) months from the date the employee started working,
unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer
period.  The services of an employee who
has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause or
when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable
standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his
engagement.  An employee who is allowed
to work after a probationary period shall be considered a regular employee.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, this decision was reversed by the NLRC, which held
that Honasan had <span style="">become a </span>regular
employee and so could not be dismissed as a probationer.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> In
its own decision dated November 27, 1992, the NLRC ordered the petitioners to
reinstate Honasan "to her former position without loss of seniority rights
and other privileges with <span style="">backwages
without deduction and qualification." Reconsideration was denied in a
resolution dated January 26, 1993.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners now fault the NLRC for having entertained
Honasan's appeal although it was filed out of time and for holding that Honasan
was already a regular employee at the time of her dismissal, which was made 4
days before the expiration of the probation period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the timeliness of the appeal, it is well-settled that all
notices which a party is entitled to receive must be coursed through his
counsel of record.  Consequently, the
running of the reglementary period is reckoned from the date of receipt of the
judgment by the counsel of the appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Notice to the appellant himself is not sufficient notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Honasan's counsel received the decision of the Labor Arbiter on May 18, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Before that, however, the appeal had already been filed by Honasan herself, on
May 8, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioners claim that she filed it on the thirteenth but this is
irrelevant.  Even if the latter date
were accepted, the appeal was nevertheless still filed on time, in fact even
before the start of the reglementary period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of illegal dismissal, we find that Honasan was
placed by the petitioner on probation twice, first during her on-the-job
training for three weeks, and next during another period of <span style="">six </span>months, ostensibly in accordance
with Article 281.  Her probation clearly
exceeded the period of <span style="">six </span>months
prescribed by this article.</p>

<p class="BODY">Probation is the period during which the employer may determine
if the employee is qualified for possible inclusion in the regular force.  In the case at bar, the period was for three
weeks, during Honasan's on-the-job training.  When her services were continued after this training, the petitioners in
effect recognized that she had passed probation and was qualified to be a
regular employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Honasan was certainly under observation during her three-week
on-the-job training.  If her services
proved unsatisfactory then, she could have been dropped as early as during that
period.  But she was not.  On the contrary, her services were continued,
presumably because they were<span style=""> </span><span style="">acceptable, although she was
formally placed this time on probation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be supposed that the probation did not end with the
three-week period of on-the-job training, there is still no reason why that
period should not be included in the stipulated six-month period of probation.  Honasan was accepted for on-the-job training
on April 15, 1991.  Assuming that her
probation could be extended beyond that date, it nevertheless could continue
only up to October 15, 1991, after the end of <span style="">six </span>months from the earlier date.  Under this more lenient approach, she had become a regular employee of
Holiday Inn and acquired full security of tenure as of October 15, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The consequence
is that she could no longer be </span>summarily separated on the ground invoked
by the petitioners.  As a regular
employee, she had acquired the protection of Article 279 of the Labor Code
stating as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 279.  <i style="">Security of </i><i style=""><span style="">Tenure</span></i><span style=""> - </span><span style="">In </span>cases of regular employment, the
employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause
or when authorized by this Title.  An
employee who is unjustly dismissed from work <span style="">shall be entitled </span>to reinstatement <span style="">without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full
backwages, inclusive of allowances, and </span>to <span style="">his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the </span>time
his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual
reinstatement.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The grounds for the removal of a regular employee are enumerated
in Articles 282, 283 and 284 of the Labor Code.  The procedure for such removal <span style="">is </span>prescribed in Rule XIV, Book V of the Omnibus Rules
Implementing the Labor Code.  These
rules were not observed in the case at bar as Honasan was simply told that her
services were being terminated because they were found to be unsatisfactory.  No administrative investigation of any kind
was undertaken to justify this ground.  She was not even accorded prior notice, let alone a chance to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find in the Hotel's system of double probation a transparent
scheme to circumvent the plain mandate of the law and make it easier for it to
dismiss its employees even after they shall have already passed probation.  The petitioners had ample time to summarily
terminate Honasan's services during her period of probation if they were deemed
unsatisfactory.  Not having done so,
they may dismiss her now only upon proof of any of the legal grounds for the
separation of regular employees, to be established according to the prescribed
procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">The policy of the Constitution is to give the utmost protection
to the working class when subjected to such maneuvers <span style="">as </span>the one attempted by the petitioners.  This Court is fully committed to that policy
and has always been quick to rise in defense of the rights of labor, as in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED, with costs against
the petitioners.  It is so ordered.</p>
