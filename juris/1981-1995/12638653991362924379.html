<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Investment and Underwriting <span style="">Corp.

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 4 and
5, 1976, defendant Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>) obtained
a loan from the plaintiff (IUCP) and executed a promissory note <span style="">No. </span>MBV 1898A in favor of the plaintiff
obligating itself to pay the latter the sum of Two Million One Hundred Four
Thousand and Six Hundred and Fifty Pesos and Fifty-One Centavos
(P2,104,650.51).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A photocopy of the

P2,104,650.51 on or before January 28, 1977 with interest at the rate of 14%
per annum to accrue immediately in case of default in payment of the note.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 29, 1976,
plaintiff and defendant's Corp. entered into a ‘Guaranty Agreement' which
states, among others, as follows:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Upon application of <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>,
IUCP had arranged with financial institution(s) for the grant to <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> of credit line(s) in the amount of TWO MILLION

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1978</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> filed its answer <u>denying</u> the
material allegations in <span class="SpellE">IUCP's</span> complaint concerning
the promissory note No. MBV 1898A for the reason that the party-signatory
thereto has been <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> to sign for and in
behalf of <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>; <u>admitting</u> the material
allegations on <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>’ account with the
Chartered Bank of Manila but that <span style="">the </span>remaining
balance is now purely nominal; <u>denying</u> the liability of Gene <span class="SpellE">Tamesis</span> for lack of consideration and due to the fact that
IUCP itself has been the controlling/comptroller of <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
at the time; denying <span class="SpellE">IUCP's</span> claim for stipulated
damages, attorney's fees and costs of suit allegedly due; the allegations that <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> failed to pay the amount due on the aforesaid
promissory note, the alleged demand for payment thereof and the failure and
refusal to pay (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 44; <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span>’
Brief, pp. 5-6).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> denied the
genuineness and due execution of the documents, such denials were not under
oath, hence under Section 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
is deemed to impliedly admitted the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1978</st1:date>,
however, <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> received a request for admission

February 28, 1980, the court <u>a</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>

<p class="BODY">On October 30, 1980, IUCP manifested that it was resting its case

the complaint, the same are deemed admitted and <span style="">a prima </span>facie case is made in their
favor and entitles them <span style="">to </span>the
judgment prayed for, unless <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>, should <span style="">prove </span>payment

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1980</st1:date>,

<p class="BODY">From said decision, IUCP appealed the case to the Court of

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE ACT OF REQUESTING FOR ADMISSION OF FACTS ALREADY
DEEMED ADMITTED BY FAILURE TO DENY THE SAME UNDER OATH CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF
THAT IMPLIED ADMISSION;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT IN <span style="">AN </span>ACTION

COMPLAINT, IT IS STILL NECESSARY FOR PLAINTIFF?APPELLANT TO PROVE
NON-PAYMENT BY THE DEFENDANT-APPELLEES EVEN IF THE LATTER HAD FAILED TO DENY
UNDER OATH THE GENUINENESS AND DUE EXECUTION OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the first issue, the answer <span style="">is </span>in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the act of IUCP in requesting for admission the genuineness
and due execution of <span style="">the </span>documents
after having obtained from <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> an implied
admission thereof may at best be considered as improper (see Francisco, Civil Procedure,
Vol. II, p. 235, 1966 ed.), the same cannot be considered as having waived such
implied admission.</p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court ruled in the case of <span class="SpellE">Sardane</span>
v<span style="">s. </span>Court of Appeals (167 SCRA
524, 533 [1988]), stating thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners’ invocation of the doctrine in Yu Chuck, et al.
vs. Kong Li Po, which was reiterated in Central Surety and <span class="SpellE">Insu</span>.
<st1:place>Co.</st1:place> v. Hodges, et al. does not sustain his thesis that
the herein private respondents had ‘waived the mantle of protection given him
by Rule 8, Section 8.’ It is true that such implied admission maybe waived by <span style="">a </span>party <u>but</u> <u>only</u> <u>if</u>
<u>he</u> <u>acts</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>manner</u> <u>indicative</u> <u>o</u>f
<u>either</u> <u>an</u> <u>express</u> <u>or</u> <u>tacit</u><span style=""> </span><u>waiver</u><span style=""> </span><u>thereof</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">P</span>etitioner, however, either overlooked
<span style="">or </span>ignored the fact that, as
held in Yu Chuck, and the same is true in other cases of identical factual
settings, <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>finding</u> <u>of</u> <u>waiver</u> <u>is</u>
<u>proper</u> <u>where</u> <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>case</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> </span><u>tried</u>
<u>in</u> <u>complete</u> <u>disregard</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>rule</u> <u>and</u>
<u>the</u> <u>plaintiff</u> <u>having</u> <u>pleaded</u> <u><span style="">a</span> document</u> <u>by</u> <u>copy,</u> <u>presents</u>
<u>oral</u> <u>evidence</u> <u>to</u> <u>prove</u> <u>the</u> <u>due execution</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>document</u> <u>and</u><span style=""> <u>no</u> </span><u>objections</u> <u>are</u> <u>made</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>defe</u><u><span style="">nd</span>ants'</u> <u>evidence</u>
<u>in</u> <u>refutation</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
situation does not obtain in the present case hence said doctrine is obviously
inapplicable." (Underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Yu Chuck (<u>supra</u>), the plaintiff <span style="">was </span>considered
to have waived the implied admission when he presented, at the beginning of the
trial, a number of witnesses and made no objections to the defendant's evidence
in refutation; and in the case of Central Surety (<u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hodges did not object to the evidence
introduced by petitioner in order to prove that one of its agent (petitioner)
had no authority to issue a surety bond, even after petitioner failed to deny
under oath the genuineness and due execution of the bond.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this Court considered the rule (Rule
8, Section 8, Rules of Court) in above cases, to have been waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, IUCP did neither of these.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">IUCP's</span>
request for admission cannot be taken as indicative of either an express or
tacit waiver thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can, at best,
be considered as a mere ‘superfluity’, to borrow the words of the lower court
viewed in another angle, but should not be considered as a waiver of the
implied admission.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, IUCP asserts that <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>,
having admitted the genuineness and due execution of the documents, there <span style="">was </span>no need
for them to present evidence nor prove non-­payment by <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
inasmuch as the facts alleged in the complaint constituted a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
case in their favor and the burden is shifted to <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
to prove payment (Appellant's Brief, pp. 12-14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>, on the
other <span style="">hand, </span>contends that the <span style="">implied </span>admission of the genuineness
and due execution of the documents does not necessarily mean that IUCP would be
automatically entitled to the money claimed without proof that said amounts are
due and unpaid by them (<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> Brief, p. 14).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the failure of <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
to deny, under oath, the genuineness and due execution of the documents does
not carry <span style="">with </span>it the admission
of payment as such is a defense of new matter that maybe alleged in a proper
plea to that effect (<span class="SpellE">Hibberd</span> v. Rohde and <span class="SpellE">McMillian</span>, 32 Phil. 476 [1915]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> it by evidence of fraud, mistake,
compromise, payment, statute of limitations, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
<span class="SpellE">annd</span> want of consideration (Bough and Bough v. <span class="SpellE">Cantiveros</span>, 40 Phil. 209 [1919]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that what is deemed admitted are
defenses relating only to the genuineness and due execution of the documents, <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> could neither put up the defense that the
documents were not signed knowingly and voluntarily nor that they are spurious
(<span class="SpellE">Kalilid</span> Wood Industries Corp. v. IAC, 155 SCRA 594
[1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, by reason of their
failure to deny the execution of the documents, under oath, a <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> <u>facie</u></span> case is made out for IUCP without adducing any
proof <span style="">whatever necessary on the part of
the latter to show that <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span> owed the amount
claimed Chamber of Commerce v. <span class="SpellE">Pua</span> Te <span class="SpellE">Ching</span>, 14 Phil. 22 [1909], citing several cases).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the self-serving allegations in the answer denying the
claims of IUCP, nowhere in the records show that <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
proved <span style="">payment thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
rested its case in the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u></span><u>uo</u><span style=""> without adducing any evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Comptronics</span>
should be held liable to their obligation with IUCP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As this Court held in the case of Philippine Commercial and
Industrial Bank v. ELRO Development Corp. (29 SCRA 38 [1969]) -</p>

<blockquote>"The promissory note sued upon was
not denied by the defendant under <span style="">oath </span>but
there <span style="">was a </span>denial of the
outstanding balance alleged in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If no partial payment had been made and no
amount was admitted as due the plaintiff, the thrust of the averments would
seem to be that there was no initial obligation incurred at all; and yet the
promissory note was not denied under oath x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, <u><span style="">if</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>payments</u> <u>had</u> <u>been</u>
