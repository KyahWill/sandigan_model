This is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the Court
 of Appeals which affirmed the finding of the trial court that there was
 a perfected contract of sale between the petitioner and the respondent 
with regard to the ten (10) hectares of land constituting the 
petitioner's share of Lot 20 PLD No. 4, Carmen Cadastre in Carmen, 
Bohol.
<p>
On May 31, 1959 the petitioner executed two documents, namely, Exhibits "A" and "B" which respectively provide:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "TO WHOM THIS MAY CONCERN: </p>
  <p> "This is to authorize Mr. Gustavo Decasa, surveyor from Batuan, 
Bohol to survey on behalf of Mr. &amp; Mrs. Alberto L. Rulona of Suba, 
Katipunan, Carmen, Bohol, a portion of the share of the undersigned of 
Lot 20 PLD No. 4 (Carmen Cadastre) from the CLARIN HERMANOS of which the
 undersigned is one of the heirs in a decision rendered in Cad. Case No.
 20, Reg. Rec. No. 200 promulgated by Judge Hipolito Alo of the Court of
 First Instance of this province dated January 6, 1956; of the ten 
hectares (10) awarded to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Alberto L. Rulona which the 
couple pur­chased from the undersigned for TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED 
PESOS (P2,500.00).  The portion of land to be surveyed is situated where
 the house and vicinity of Mr &amp; Mrs. A. Rulona are located in said 
lot. </p>

    (SGD.) OLEGARIO B. CLARIN
  </p>
  <p>
    (SGD.) ZOILA L. CLARIN
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
"Received from Mr. Alberto Rulona of Carmen, Bohol, the sum of Eight 
Hundred (P800.00) Pesos as an initial payment for the ten hectares of 
land in Carmen, Bohol which he is going to purchase from the 
undersigned.  The value of the land in question is P2,500.00."
</p><p>
Respondent Rulona filed a complaint for specific performance and 
recovery of improvements on the ground that the petitioner and his wife 
violated the terms of the agree­ment of sale "by returning by their own 
volition and without the consent of plaintiff, the amount of P1,100.00 
in six postal money orders, covering the downpayment of P1,000.00 and 
first installment of P100.00."
</p><p>
In his complaint, the respondent alleged that the petitioner sold ten 
hectares of his share of the disputed lot to him for P2,500.00.  The 
conditions of the sale were that a downpayment of P1,000.00 was to be 
made and then the balance of P1,500.00 was to be paid in monthly 
installment of P100.00.  As shown by Exhibit B, the respondent delivered
 to the petitioner a downpayment of P800.00 and on the first week of 
June the amount of P200.00 was also deli­vered thereby completing the 
downpayment of P1,000.00.  On the first week of August, another delivery
 was made by the respondent in the amount of P100.00 as payment for the 
first installment.  Respondent further alleged that despite repeated 
demands to let the sale continue and for the petitioner to take back the
 six postal money orders, the latter refused to comply.
</p><p>
In his answer, the petitioner alleged that while it is true that he had a
 projected contract of sale of a portion of land with the respondent, 
such was subject to the follow­ing conditions:  (1) that the contract 
would be realized only if his co-heirs would give their consent to the 
sale of a specific portion of their common inheritance from the late 
Aniceto Clarin before partition of the said common property and (2) that
 should his co-heirs refuse to give their consent, the projected 
contract would be discontinued or would not be realized.  Petitioner 
further contended that the respondent knew fully well the above terms 
and accepted them as conditions precedent to the perfection or 
consummation of the contract; that respondent delivered the amount of 
P1,000.00 as earnest money, subject to the above conditions and that the
 amount was returned by the petitioner upon his learning definitely that
 his co-heirs and co-owners refused to give their consent to the 
projected sale.
</p><p>
The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the respondent on the ground 
that the contract of sale, Exhibit A, is a pure sale of a portion of Lot
 No. 20, containing an area of ten hectares for the sum of P2,500.00, 
and that the sale is not subject to any condition nor is it vitiated by 
any flaw.  Therefore, it declared the same binding upon the parties 
under Articles 1356 and 1458 of the Civil Code.  The trial court also 
ruled that the fact that petitioner returned the sum of P1,100.00 paid 
by the respondent indicated an intention to rescind the contract.  The 
court stated, however, that rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil 
Code can be authorized by the court only if either party violates his 
obligation.  Since there had been no violation, the court ruled that the
 petitioner could not rescind the contract.  Lastly, the court held that
 although as co-owner the petitioner could not dispose of a specific 
portion of the land, nevertheless, his share was bound by the effect of 
the sale.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    On appeal, the Court of Appeals sustained the findings of the trial court, stating that:

</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x We believe that the trial court did not incur any error 
when it arrived at the conclusion that there was a perfected contract of
 sale between the plaintiff and the defendant, for indeed the terms of 
the agreement (Exh. A) were clearly drafted in an equivocal manner that 
leaves no room for interpretation other than those terms contained 
therein, the real substance of which satisfied all the elements and 
requisites of a contract.  Appellant, however, argues that Exhibit A was
 a mere authority to survey.  It is not addressed to any definite party,
 it does not contain the proper heading, there is no statement of the 
manner of paying the purchase price, no personal circumstances of the 
parties, and it is not notarized.  All these grounds relied upon to suit
 the theory of appellant, anchored as it were on a weak foundation, 
deserve scant consideration.  Suffice it to state that a contract to be 
binding upon the contracting parties need not be notarized.  Neither 
should it specify the manner of payment of the consideration nor should it 
contain the proper heading." (sic) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is maintained in this petition that the appellate court erred in 
holding there was a perfected contract of sale between the petitioner 
and the respondent, principally relying on Exhi­bit A and that even 
assuming that the latter were a perfected contract of sale, such was 
subject to a condition precedent with which there was no compliance.  
The petitioner alleges that the two documents introduced in evidence 
could not effectively convey title to the land because they were not 
public documents.  Lastly, the petitioner contends that he could not 
have validly disposed of a definite portion of the community pro­perty 
and therefore, there arose a legal impossibility for him and the 
respondent to agree on a definite object.
</p><p>
The petitioner's contentions are without merit.
</p><p>
While it is true that Exhibits A and B are, in themselves, not contracts
 of sale, they are, however, clear evidence that a contract of sale was 
perfected between the petitioner and the respondent and that such 
contract had already been partially fulfilled and executed.  A contract 
of sale is perfected at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the 
thing which is the object of the contract and upon the price.  (Article 
1475, Civil Code; Phil. Virginia Tobacco Administration v. De los 
Angeles, 87 SCRA 210).  Such contract is binding in whatever form it may
 have been entered into.  (Lopez v. Auditor General, 20 SCRA 655).
</p><p>
Construing Exhibits A and B together, it can be seen that the petitioner
 agreed to sell and the respondent agreed to buy a definite object, that
 is, ten hectares of land which is part and parcel of Lot 20 PLD No. 4, 
owned in common by the petitioner and his sisters although the 
boundaries of the ten hectares would be delineated at a later date.  The
 parties also agreed on a definite price which is P2,500.00.  Exhibit B 
further shows that the petitioner has received from the respondent as 
initial payment, the amount of P800.00.  Hence, it cannot be denied that
 there was a perfected contract of sale between the parties and that 
such contract was already partially executed when the petitioner 
received the initial payment of P800.00.  The latter's acceptance of the
 payment clearly showed his consent to the contract thereby precluding 
him from rejecting its binding effect.  (See Federation of United 
Namarco Distributors, Inc. v. National Marketing Corporation, 4 SCRA 
884).  With the contract being partially executed, the same is no longer
 covered by the requirements of the Statute of Frauds in order to be 
enforceable.  (See Khan v. Asuncion, 19 SCRA 996).  Therefore, with the 
contract being valid and enforceable, the petitioner cannot avoid his 
obligation by interposing that Exhibit A is not a public document.  On 
the contrary, under Article 1357 of the Civil Code, the petitioner can 
even be compelled by the respondent to execute a public document to 
embody their valid and enforceable contract.
</p><p>
The petitioner's contention that he was only forced to receive money 
from the respondent due to the insistence of the latter merits little 
consideration.  It is highly improbable that the respondent would give 
different sums on separate dates to the petitioner with no apparent 
reason, without a binding assurance from the latter that the disputed 
lot would be sold to him.  We agree with the trial court and the 
appellate court that the payments were made in fulfillment of the 
conditions of the sale, namely, a downpayment of P1,000.00 and the 
balance of P1,500.00, to be paid in monthly installments of P100.00 
each.
</p><p>
We, therefore, find no error in the lower court's holding that a 
contract of sale was perfected between the petitioner and the respondent
 and that the sale did not depend on a condition that the petitioner's 
co-owners would have to agree to the sale.  The latter finding is 
strengthened by the fact that although the petitioner has been stressing
 that he made it clear to the respondent that the consent of his sisters
 as co-owners was necessary in order for the sale to push through, his 
letter to respondent marked Exhibit C stated another reason, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "My dear Mr. Rulona: </p>
  <p> Replying to your letter of recent date, I deeply regret to inform 
you that my daughter, Alice, who is now in Manila, could not be 
convinced by me to sell the land in question, that is, the ten (10) 
hectares of land re­ferred to in our tentative agreement.  It is for 
this reason that I hereby authorize the bearer, Mr. Paciano Parmisano, 
to return to you in person the sum of One Thousand and One Hundred 
(P1,100.00) Pesos which you have paid in advance for the proposed sale 
of the land in question."
  </p>

  <p>
    The reasons given by the petitioner cannot operate against the 
validity of the contract in question.  A contract is valid even though 
one of the parties entered into it against his better judgment.  (See 
Lagunzad v. Vda. de Gonzales, 92 SCRA 476; citing Martinez v. Hongkong 
and Shanghai Bank, 15 Phil. 252).
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Finally, we agree with the lower court's holding that although as a 
co-owner, the petitioner cannot dispose of a specific portion of the 
land, his share shall be bound by the effect of the sale.  This is 
anchored in Article 493 of the Civil Code which provides:
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
      Art. 493.  Each co-owner shall have the full ownership of his part
 and the fruits and benefits pertaining thereto, and he may therefore 
alienate, assign or mortgage it, and even substitute another person in 
its enjoyment, except when personal rights are involved.  But the effect
 of the alienation or the mortgage, with respect to the co-owners, shall
 be limited to the portion which may be allotted to him in the division 
upon the termination of the co-ownership.
    </p>
</blockquote>

WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit.  Costs against the petitioner.
