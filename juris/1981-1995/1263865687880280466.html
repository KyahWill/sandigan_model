conspiring and confederating together with three (3) John Does whose true
names, identities and present whereabouts are still unknown and mutually
helping and aiding one another, armed with a knife, with intent of gain and by
means of force, violence and intimidation, did, then and there willfully,

inflicting upon him stab wounds which directly caused his death, and one <span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> y <span class="SpellE">Nacion</span> the driver of the said passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
on the vital parts of his body, thereby inflicting upon him stab wounds which
ordinarily would have caused his death, thus performing all the acts of
execution which should have produced the crime of homicide as a consequence,
but nevertheless did not produce it by reason of cause independent of the will
of the accused, that is, due to the timely and able medical attendance rendered
to the said <span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>

<p class="2Q">[Trial Court Decision, p. 7.]</p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment of conviction, the appellant filed the present
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first issue raised by the appellant pertains to the
credibility of the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the culpability of the appellant, the prosecution
presented the following witnesses: <span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, the driver of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>:
Richard Bales, the <span style="">companion/conductor
of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>; Betty <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>,
a passenger of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>; Dr. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Ligot</span>, the physician who examined <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>;
Pat. <span class="GramE">Bill <span class="SpellE">Ayun</span> and Pat.</span> <span class="GramE">Jaime <span class="SpellE">Ganueda</span>, of the <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>

to prove the civil liability arising from the crime; (1) Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>, the mother of the victim Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>; and (2) Amada <span class="SpellE">Yaco</span>, the
mother-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant specifically assails the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, Betty <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and Richard Bales, all of whom positively
identified the appellant as one of the perpetrators of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, while he was
driving his fully loaded passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> on the
evening of <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1985</st1:date>
from <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> to <span class="SpellE">Cogeo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>, he heard a person from
the back announce a hold-up, which made him <span style="">pull the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to a sudden stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon, the passenger immediately behind
him, or on the extreme left side of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>,
poked a bladed weapon on the right side of his neck (TSN, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="8"><span style="">August
 14, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, p. 5.] <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> was able to identify the person who poked the
knife at him as the appellant David <span class="SpellE">Loveria</span> because
the former managed to turn his face towards the latter [TSN, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="8"><span style="">August
 21, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, p. 13.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> was then taken by the
appellant and three other men inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, at
the back portion thereof, and was stabbed several times [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1985</st1:date>, p. 6.] After the
stabbing, <span class="SpellE">Manzanero’s</span> wristwatch and earnings were
taken from him [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1985</st1:date>,
p. 17.] Injured, <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> rolled down from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> but was able to flee [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1985</st1:date>, p<span style="">. </span>11.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Richard Bales, the companion/conductor of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>,
who was<span style=""> </span>seated on the front <span class="GramE">seat</span> corroborated the testimony of the <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>
on almost all its material <span style="">points.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He testified that he saw the appellant stab <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> [TSN, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="6"><span style="">June 23, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="">, pp</span><span style="">. </span><span style="">3-4 &amp; 16.] However,
Bales added that after the four men were finished with <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>,
they turned to him and Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>, a passenger
who was also seated on the front seat beside Bales [<u>Id</u>. </span>pp. <span style="">6-7.] One of the robbers, whom Bales identified
as a certain Martin Castaneda, stabbed him, injuring his finger, and took his
watch [<u>Id.</u>] The other robbers chased <span class="SpellE">Yamson</span>,
who attempted to flee and stabbed him on the neck (<u>id.,</u></span><span style=""> pp. 16-17.) <span class="SpellE">Y<span style="">amson</span></span></span><span style=""> was taken to the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quirino</span></span><span style=""> Memorial General</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> but died that same night [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">“F” (Medico-Legal Certificate) and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">“G” (Autopsy Report).]</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Betty S. <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, a passenger who
was seated on the left side of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> testified
that the four hold­-up men boarded the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> [TSN, October 9, 1985, p. 5] and seated themselves on
the four corners of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> [<u>Id</u>, p. 6.] <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> stated that she saw the appellant David <span class="SpellE">Loveria</span> poke a knife at the driver, pull the latter from
the driver’s seat, and stab him after taking him to the inner back portion of
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> [<st1:state><st1:place><u>Id.</u></st1:place></st1:state>,
pp. 4-5.] She was able to remember the appellant because <span style="">she was the third passenger from the driver’s
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In </span><span style="">other words, there
was only one person between her and the appellant [</span><st1:state><st1:place><u><span style="">Id.</span></u></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">, p. 4.] <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
also testified that the hold-up men forcibly took valuables from the passengers
[</span><st1:state><st1:place><u><span style="">Id</span></u><span style="">.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style="">, p. 8.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the trial court erred <span style="">in </span>giving credence to the testimony of
<span class="SpellE">Cerilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, the
driver, because of its improbability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant argues that “[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]f indeed the
purpose was to stab the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, then there
was no need to bring him to the rear portion of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
to accomplish the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">could be stabbed while seated at the driver’s
seat.” [Appellant’s <span class="GramE">Brief</span>, p. 7.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> could have been
stabbed by the appellant while the former was at the driver’s seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But neither was it improbable for appellant
to have stabbed <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> in the <span style="">manner described by the latter and
corroborated by </span>witnesses <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and
Bales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motive which impelled the
appellant and his companions in pulling <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> out
of the driver’s seat and stabbing him at the inner <span style="">rear </span>portion of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> is known only to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court will not speculate as to why the
appellant and his companions executed the crime in the manner that they
did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Crimes are known to have been
executed in odd and unusual ways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in
the instant case, the Court is of the considered view that there was nothing
strange nor improbable in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span> and Bales that after the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> stopped, the appellant poked a knife at <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, pulled the latter out of the driver’s seat, and
together with his companions took him to the rear portion of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> where <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> was
eventually stabbed and robbed of his wristwatch and earnings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant next turns to witness Betty S. <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>,
contending that she failed to positively identify the appellant because when
asked to identify any of the holdup men who may be present in court, she stated
the following <span style="">in </span>reference to
the appellant:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>“I think he is the one
wearing a white T-shirt” [TSN, <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1985</st1:date>, p. 7.] However, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario’s</span> use
of the expression “I think” does not necessarily indicate her uncertainty as to
the identity of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
when the defense tried to exploit, during the cross-examination of <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>, the seemingly tentative statement just quoted,
it became apparent that she was sure and positive about the <span style="">identity of the <span class="SpellE">apppellant</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent <span style="">portion of the </span>cross-examination is quoted as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Q
- <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. Witness you also testified <span style="">last </span>time in answer to the question <span style="">of the p</span>rivate prosecutor, I quote,
“This person who stabbed the <span style="">driver if
you </span>will see him, will you be able to identify him?” and you said “Yes,
sir”.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next question, “Will <span style="">you please </span>tell us whether this person
<span style="">is present </span>in this courtroom?”
and you <span style="">said “I </span>think he is the
one wearing <span style="">a

<p class="BODY">To impugn further the credibility of the <span style="">prosecution </span>witnesses, the appellant cites alleged <span style="">inconsistencies </span>between the sworn

on the other <span style="">hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>appellant claims that <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> did not mention in his affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">“I”) that the hold-up men took <span style="">his money </span>and valuables but on
cross-examination, he declared that the holdup men took his wristwatch and the <span style="">boundary for </span><span style="">the day.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant further claims that Richard <span style="">Bales </span>did not implicate him in </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">affidavit but <span style="">pointed to him </span>on
the witness stand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Affidavits, taken <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>, are generally considered to be inferior to the

The Court has consistently held that an affidavit, taken <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u>, is almost always incomplete and inaccurate,
sometimes from partial </span>suggestions, sometimes from want of suggestions
and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the
connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction of the first
suggestions of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all that belongs
to the subject [People v. Tan, 89 Phil. 337 (1951); People v. Gonzales, G.R.

<p class="BODY">It has likewise been held that inconsistencies between the
testimonies given during the investigation stage and during the court
proceedings may be disregarded without impairing the credibility of the
witnesses, considering such factors as illiteracy [People v. Sato, G.R. No. L-47911,
July 27, 1988, 163 SCRA 602] or inability of the witness to read the language
in which the <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> affidavit was written
[People v. <span class="SpellE">Capinpin</span>, Jr., G.R. No. 67785, October 4,
1988, 166 SCRA 233.] In the instant case, <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>
explained his failure to state in the affidavit that certain things were taken
from him, by the fact that at the time of the execution of the affidavit, he ha<span style="">d just checked out from the hospital and was
still under medication [TSN, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="8"><span style="">August 21, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="">, p. 17.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a final assault on the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses, the appellant notes the delay by the former in reporting the
incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed on <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> reported the matter to the police on <st1:date year="1985" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1985</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

it is evident that the lapse of time between the commission of the crime and
the filing by <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> of </span>a <span style="">complaint with the <span class="GramE">police,</span>
was due to the fact that he was still recuperating from the wounds inflicted on
him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she was presented in court to testify, these circumstances alone should not
destroy their credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule is
well-established that the failure to reveal or disclose at once the identity of
the accused does not necessarily affect, much less impair, the credibility of
the witness [People v. Valdez, G.R. No. 75390, March 25, 1988, 159 SCRA 152.]
The initial reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information about a criminal
case and their unwillingness to be involved in criminal investigations due to
fear of reprisal is common and has been judicially <span style="">declared not to affect credibility [People v. Rosario, G.R.

<p class="BODY">In fine, the Court, after a thorough examination of the entire
record of the case, especially the transcript of stenographic notes, finds the trial
court’s reliance on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses to convict the
appellant, to be well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
claims made by the <span style="">appellant have not
impaired the credibility of the prosecution witnesses who positively identified
him as one of the perpetrators of the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant assails the manner in which he was
identified by <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> at the headquarters of the
225th Philippine Constabulary (PC) in <span class="SpellE">Cogeo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, claiming
violation of his constitutional right to counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sec. 20, Art. IV of the 1973 Constitution, which was in force at
the time the events under review occurred reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 20.</span> No person shall be compelled to
be witness against himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person
under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to
remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or
any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in the evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Sec. 12 (1), Art.</span> III of the 1987
Constitution provides similar guarantees by stating:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 12(1).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any person under investigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and to have competent
and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the person cannot afford the services of
counsel, he must be provided with one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of
counsel.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court must emphasize that the so-called Miranda rights
contained in the <span class="SpellE">abovequoted</span> constitutional
provisions may be invoked by a person only while he is <span style="">under custodial investigation [People v. <span class="SpellE">Duero</span>,
G.R. No. 52016, May 13, 1981, 104 SCRA 379.] which has been defined as the
“questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been
taken into custody or </span>otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any
significant way” [People v. <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-38975, </span><st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="">January 17, 1980</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, 95 SCRA 2, 9 citing

rights may no longer be claimed by a defendant in a criminal case already
pending in court [People v. <span class="SpellE">Ayson</span>, G.R. No. 85215,
July 7, 1989] because he is no longer under custodial investigation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The ruling enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Gamboa</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><u>v.</u> <u>Cruz,</u> G.R. No.
56291, <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1988</st1:date>, 162
SCRA 642), concerning the right to counsel of a person under custodial
investigation finds application in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the accused was arrested for
vagrancy and taken to the police station.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The following day he was placed on <span style="">a </span>line-up and a female complainant pointed
to him as one of the persons who robbed her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While on trial, the accused filed a motion to acquit or demurrer to
evidence on the ground, among others, that he was deprived of his
constitutional right to counsel at the time the complainant was in the process
of accusing or identifying him for allegedly committing a crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion having been denied by the trial court,
the accused filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with the
Supreme Court, which ruled that the right to counsel of a person under
custodial investigation cannot be invoked until such time that the police
investigators start questioning, interrogating or exacting a confession from
the person under investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court held that <span style="">in </span>the police
line-up conducted in that particular case, it was the complainant who was being
<span style="">investigated and who gave a statement
to the police while </span>the accused was not questioned at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court concluded that the latter
could not, during the line-up, invoke his right to counsel because he was not
under custodial interrogation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>, upon learning that certain
hold-up men were being detained at the 225th PC Company, <span class="SpellE">Cogeo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span>
in connection with another robbery, went there to check.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having identified the appellant among the

</span>Thereafter, Pat. Bill <span class="SpellE">Ayun</span> accompanied <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> back to the PC headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> where <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>
identified to Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ayun</span> the appellant as one of the
persons involved in the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Ayun</span> then took the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>
which was presented in court as <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. “B” [TSN, <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="12">December 8, 1986</st1:date>, p. 3.] Since, as in
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Gamboa</u></span> case, the appellant was not
investigated when <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> was in the process of
identifying him, he cannot claim that his right to counsel was violated because
at that stage, he was not entitled to the constitutional guarantee invoked.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">But even assuming that the process of
identification of the appellant by <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span> at the
PC headquarters was attended by constitutional infirmities, only <span class="SpellE">Manzanero’s</span> sworn statement [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
“B”] where he identified appellant and which was taken by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Ayun</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
would be excluded for being inadmissible in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Manzanero</span>
made in open court positively identifying the appellant, as well as those of
Richard Bales and Betty <span class="SpellE">Apolinaria</span>, would not be
affected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These testimonies, taken together
with the other evidence on record would be sufficient to sustain the trial
court’s judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi put up by the appellant has not helped him
any for it has not destroyed the damaging effects of the evidence for the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Courts look upon the
defense of alibi with suspicion and always receive it with caution, not only
because it is inherently weak but also because of its easy fabrication [People
