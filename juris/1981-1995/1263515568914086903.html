Rodney Espinosa, alias Rodney Secuilan, was standing about four feet away from Jesus Espinosa, Jr., when the latter shot Agusto Elon.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The shooting of Agusto Elon was witnessed by his father Juan Elon because at that time, he was sleeping in the house of his daughter Cynthia, which house is situated along the road, or along Zamora Extension Street. He was requested by his daughter to sleep at her house, which is only fifteen (15) meters away from his own house, as Cynthia's husband was at Lemery, Iloilo, at that time, and she and her children had no companion in their house.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">As earlier stated, the house of Cynthia Elon Villanueva is located along or about one (1) foot from Zamora Extension Street. The fence of her house which is made of hollow blocks is at the same time the wall of the front of her house.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The place where his son was shot was well lighted and there was an electric light at the post near the place of the incident. When Jesus Espinosa, Jr. shot Agusto Elon he was about three feet away, more or less, from the deceased. The deceased was facing the wall when he was shot and his back was turned towards the accused, Jesus Espinosa, Jr.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Juan Elon cried aloud when he saw his son being shot and ran downstairs, towards him, but he stumbled at the mosquito net of his grandchildren. His wife who was sleeping at their house, which is very near the house of his daughter, arrived first at the scene of the incident. When he reached his son, Juan Elon embraced him. He saw that the bullets were "bulging" on his forehead and blood was oozing from his neck. He was already dead. He recognized the accused because he worked as a "stevedore" at the pier, and had also worked with the grandfather of the accused and had known the accused since they were small.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">At the time of his death, Agusto Elon was only 21 years old. Although a deaf mute, his son was employed at "Basic Fruit Corporation" situated at Pavia, Iloilo. His job was "peeling banana", to be made into "banana chips" but he does not know how much his son was earning.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">His son usually went home at about 10 to 11 o'clock in the evening, because before going home he used to pass at the back of the church at Jaro, Iloilo, to visit his friends, who were also deaf mutes.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">After his son died, the cadaver was embalmed and an autopsy was conducted. He paid funeraria Porras the amount of Three Thousand Six Hundred (P3,600.00) Pesos, for funeral services. He also hired 6 jeepneys during the funeral at Fifty (P50.00) Pesos. He bought "Zest-O" Juice during the funeral, for the merienda of the deceased's friends, he spent the amount of One Thousand Four Hundred (P1,400.00) Pesos. He also bought bread and sandwich spread and spent One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos. For the "pantheon" of his son he spent Six Hundred (P600.00) Pesos. For church services, Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos, or a total amount of Four Thousand Four Hundred Fifty (P4,450. 00) Pesos.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The testimony of Juan Elon, the father of the deceased was corroborated by another eyewitness Romualdo Robles.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">He testified that while he was on his way home to Zamora Extension Street, at around 11:40 in the evening of February 13, 1993, coming from Rotary park and while he was across the street in front of the house of Juan Elon, he saw Jesus Espinosa, Jr. shoot Agusto Elon or "Apa Elon", in front of their house at Zamora Extension, Iloilo City. He was about fifteen to twenty meters away from the place of the incident and the place was well lighted.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">At the time of the shooting, Agusto Elon was urinating and the deceased was about three to four feet away from the assailant. He saw Jesus Espinosa, Jr. shoot "Apa" Elon three times and the deceased fell on his face on the fence (nagdamhag sa kudal) and he fell on the ground on his back.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(pp. 70-73,&nbsp; <i>Rollo</i>)<br></div><br>Accused-appellant maintains that the prosecution failed in its task to identify him positively as the perpetrator of the crime. The evidence does not support accused-appellant's contention. Two eyewitnesses to the shooting positively identified accused-appellant as the person who shot the victim. Prosecution witness Romualdo Robles positively and unequivocally identified accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime. Robles testified thusly:<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Atty.

font-style: italic;">Because the street was well-lighted and there is a post-lamp and the light at the houses were lighting.</div></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;">(pp. 12-15, <span style="font-style: italic;">ibid</span>).<br></div><br>Accused-appellant questions the veracity of the testimony of Juan Elon, maintaining that Juan Elon was asleep at the time that the victim was shot. Again the evidence does not substantiate accused-appellant's contention. Juan Elon unequivocably testified that he was fully awake when the shooting took place.<br><br><blockquote style="font-style: italic;">ATTY. MACAHILIG:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What time did you wake up after having gone to sleep?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I am already old and my sleep is not so heavy and it is so light that I can hear the noise and I hear the trisykad that stopped and I saw my son alighted from that trisykad.</div></blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;">(p. 29, tsn., July 7, 1993)<br></div><br>In the absence of any ill motive on the part of Juan Elon to point to accused-appellant as the perpetrator of the crime charged, Juan Elon's testimony must be given full faith and credit (P<span style="font-style: italic;">eople vs. Tolentino</span>, 218 SCRA 337 [1993]). A thorough search of the record fails to uncover any such ill motive. Neither does his relationship to the victim impair his credibility (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Dominguez,</span> 217 SCRA 170 [1993]).<br><br>Further, accused-appellant impugns the testimony of prosecution witness Romualdo Robles. Accused-appellant asserts that the testimony of Robles to the effect that Juan Elon and his wife went out of the house together is inconsistent with the testimony of Juan Elon that his wife went out of their house first then followed by him. The question of who got out of their respective houses first is obviously a minor, trivial, and inconsequential matter that cannot adversely affect the testimony of Robles that he saw accused-appellant shoot the victim.<br><br>Accused-appellant also assails Robles for his failure to immediately report what he saw to the policeman who arrived at the scene of the crime. Such failure does not subvert the credibility of Robles, for as explained by him he immediately went home after the shooting because he was afraid that he might get involved (p. 7, tsn., July 23, 1993).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The reticence of Cabatas to immediately reveal the said statement to the police officers was satisfactorily explained; he was then afraid. The natural reluctance of witnesses to volunteer information to the police authorities in criminal cases is a matter of judicial notice. He might have deemed it the better part of valor not to give the name of the accused who was still at large and who probably recognized him. Such reluctance should not affect his testimony. The decisive factor is that he in fact identified the accused.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Viente</span>, 225 SCRA 361, 370.)<br></div><br>In an attempt to destroy the credibility of Robles, accused-appellant presented a certification of Kilayko Express Services, Inc. to the effect that Robles had never been an employee thereat, this to rebut the statement of Robles that he was an errand boy of Kilayko Express, Inc. In this regard, we fully agree with the following observation of the trial court:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The defense would like to assail the credibility of Romualdo Robles, the second witness of the prosecution by presenting a certification issued by the president or general manager of Kilayko Express, Inc., Victor Kilayko, that Mr. Romualdo Robles has not been an employee of Kilayko Express, Inc. in whatever capacity since 1990 up to 1993. But Romualdo Robles never asserted that he was an employee of Kilayko Express, Inc. He merely testified that he was a mere "errand boy" or "messenger" but not a regular employee. He received no regular salary and he accepted whatever amount that might be given to him as an errand boy. As a matter of fact, in his personal circumstances, he stated that he was jobless.</span><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">(pp. 25-26,&nbsp; <i>Rollo</i>.)<br></div><br>We reject the defense of alibi put up by accused-appellant not only because alibi cannot prevail over the positive identification by the prosecution witnesses (People vs. Dominguez, 217 SCRA 170 [1993], but also because accused?appellant has failed to establish that it was physically impossible for him to have been present at the place where the crime was committed at the time it happened. (<span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Flores</span>, 217 SCRA 613 [1993]). In the case at bench, accused-appellant professes that he was in a fishpond situated at Brgy. Taguangin, Ajuy, Iloilo at the time of the commission of the crime. However, said place is only 80 kilometers away from Iloilo City, and can be negotiated by bus in about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Therefore, the element of physical impossibility of presence of accused-appellant at the scene and the time of the crime does not obtain.<br><br>We, however, agree with accused-appellant that the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender should be taken into consideration in fixing the penalty. The trial court itself stated that the record shows the fact of voluntary surrender but refrained from taking it into consideration because, according to the trial court, the report or the warrant of arrest was not offered in evidence. There was no need for said report to be submitted in evidence because the court can take cognizance of it, the same being part of the record.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is a settled rule that a tribunal may at any time take judicial notice of the records of a case pending before it.</span><br><br>(<i style="font-style: italic;">Universal Textile Mills, Inc. vs</i><span style="font-style: italic;">. Court of Industrial Relations</span>; 36 SCRA 619, 623 [1970])<br><br>We nonetheless concur with the following findings of the trial court that the killing of the victim was characterized by treachery:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In this case, it was clearly shown beyond reasonable doubt that the back of the deceased was turned to the accused, when he was shot three times. He was urinating when shot and was defenseless. He was unaware what happened to him. He could not have put up any defense at all. In short, the accused in executing the crime, employed means, methods or forms which tend directly and specially to ensure its execution, without risks to himself arising from the defense which the offended party might make.
