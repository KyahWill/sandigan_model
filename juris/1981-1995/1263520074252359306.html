Sometime on December 10, 1979, Minister of Transportation and Communications
Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Dans</span>, Jr., in a letter-memorandum to the
President of the Philippines, recommended, among others, the transfer of the
offices of the Board of Transportation from <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City to a two-storey building in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila
for the reason that the building where the offices of the BOT are housed is
also occupied by other offices, hence, BOT offices are accessible to fixers and
unofficial personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, upon instruction of its Chairman, began transferring
its records. On January 28, 1980, private respondent filed a petition for
prohibition and/or injunction with preliminary injunction, seeking to prevent
the proposed transfer to <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro Manila, on
grounds that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">it is illegal, in grave
abuse of </span>discretion, in gross defiance of law and highly inimical not
only to the interest of private respondent but to the government and the public
as well; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that the </span>proposed
transfer will cause difficulties to utility operators and drivers in going to,
and from <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, more especially when the government
has imposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a ban </span>against <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> cruising along E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos Avenue; that the inefficient service of Republic Telephone Company which
has the exclusive franchise to operate a telephone system in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">will </span>make
it very difficult to make contact with the new BOT offices.</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of respondent Judge Jose P. Castro, to whom the case
was assigned, to resolve the motion for the dissolution of the restraining
order, the motion for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and the
motion to dismiss, the present case was instituted before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The core of petitioner's argument in the present petition is the
inaction for an unreasonable length of time of respondent Judge Jose P. Castro
on the motion for immediately resolution of the application for a writ of
preliminary injunction and on the motion for dissolution of the restraining
order. Such inaction, amounting to grave abuse of discretion and tantamount to
lack of jurisdiction, practically paralyzed the operations of petitioner to the
detriment of public interest considering that some of the records of BOT were already
transferred to Sandoval Building while most of the records were already packed
and ready to be transferred when the restraining order was issued. Petitioner
likewise prays that this Court resolve its motion to dismiss instead of
remanding the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">case
</span>to the lower court because the issue raised in said motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>one of
law --- whether private respondent has the right to prohibit or enjoin
petitioner from transferring its offices.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of this Court dated <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1980</st1:date>, respondents were required to file
answer to the petition and the case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1980</st1:date> which was reset on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1980</st1:date>. Private respondent,
in its answer dated April 17, 1980, alleges that as taxpayers, its members are
legally entitled to bring this suit against the proposed transfer of BOT
because the building rental with the owner of Sandoval Building in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> has been increased to P33.00 per square meter
compared to P13.00 per square meter in Gutierrez-David Building; that under
Section 10 of the Public Service Act, the Public Service Commission (now BOT)
is mandated "to have its office in the City of Manila or at such other
place as may be designated"; that BOT has a correlative obligation to stay
in Manila or at its present site, the latter being declared as a National
Government Center; that when BOT decided to transfer as it did transfer part of
its records to a site in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, the BOT violated the
law creating it, at the same time, causing injury or wrong prejudicial to
private respondent's primary right to deal with the BOT at its site mandated by
law. Furthermore, private respondent claims that under LOI No. 767 before a
head of ministry, bureau or agency can enter into a <span class="GramE">contract,</span>
the chief accountant concerned must certify that funds are available from
allotments actually released by the Ministry of Budget. However, in the present
case, in the contract of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">lease </span>entered into by and between petitioner and the owner of
Sandoval Building, the amount certified to as available by the BOT Chief
Accountant is only equivalent to one month rental instead of the rentals for
one year as required by the aforesaid LOI No. 767.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
27.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On April 21, 1980, this Court, after hearing, issued a temporary
restraining order enjoining respondent judges and their representatives from
stopping the transfer of the offices of petitioner BOT from the Gutierrez-David
Building <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
</span>City to the Sandoval Building in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, Metro
Manila. The offices of BOT are now located in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this petition is whether or not respondent
Judge Jose Castro acted with grave abuse of discretion when he failed to act
immediately and without delay on petitioner's motion to lift the restraining
order and private respondent's motion for a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">We find merit in the
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Jose Castro committed grave abuse of discretion
in failing to resolve without considerable delay, petitioner's motion for the
dissolution of the restraining order and private respondent's motion for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. It must be noted that the present
case was filed before the lower court on <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1980</st1:date> and on the same day respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Ernani</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Paño</span> issued <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> and without bond, the questioned temporary <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">restraining </span>order. The application for
the issuance of a preliminary injunction was heard on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date> but respondent Judge Jose Castro
failed to rule on the motion. During the hearing on <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="2">February 19, 1980</st1:date>, BOT again vigorously pressed
for the resolution of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the aforesaid
motion and for the lifting of the restraining </span>order but despite repeated
plea, the request of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">BOT </span>went
unheeded which prompted it to file this case before this Court on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge should have acted on the pending matters before
it. At the time the restraining order was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">issued, some </span>of the records of BOT were already transferred to the
Sandoval Building in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, while most of the other
records were already packed and ready to be transferred. Due to the restraining
order, the operations of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">BOT </span>were
hampered causing prejudice to persons who have transactions with the BOT. It
must be remembered that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>restraining order <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is
an </span>order to maintain the subject of the contro­versy in <u>status</u> <u>quo</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">until the </span>hearing of an
application for a temporary injunction. Unless extended by the court, a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">restraining order ceases </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>be operative at the expiration of
the time fixed by its terms. In cases where it has been granted <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> as in this case, it may be dissolved upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">motion b</span>efore answer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Due to the indiscriminate issuance of <u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>
restraining order, Section 5 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of Rule 58
of the Rules of Court was amended on April 16, 1982 by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 224 which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 5.</span> <u>Preliminary injunction
not granted without notice; issuance of restraining order</u>. - No preliminary
injunction shall be granted without notice to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">de</span>fendant. If it shall appear from the facts shown by affidavits
or by the verified complaint that great or irreparable injury would result to
the applicant before the matter can be heard on notice, the judge to whom the
application for preliminary injunction was made, may issue a restraining order
to be effective only for a period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">twenty
</span>days from date of its issuance. Within the said twenty-day period, the
judge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">must </span>cause an order to be
served on the defendant requiring him to show cause, at a specified time and
place, why the injunction should not be granted, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">determine </span>within the same period
whether or not the preliminary injunction shall be granted, and shall accordingly
issue the corresponding order. In the event that the application for
preliminary injunction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is denied, the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">restraining order </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:

expiration of the 20-day period the application for preliminary injunction is
denied, the temporary restraining order would thereby be deemed automatically
vacated. If no action is taken by the judge on the application for preliminary
injunction within the said 20 days, the temporary restraining order would
automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force of law, no judicial
declaration to that effect being necessary. A temporary restraining order can
no longer exist indefinitely for it has become truly temporary.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

adopted is to prevent and/or correct the deplorable situation, as in the
present case, resulting from the inaction of a judge on a motion to lift a
restraining order for an unreasonable length of time. The questioned
restraining order was issued on January 28, 1980 but after a lapse of fifty-two
(52) days from said date up to the time when the present petition was filed
before this Court, no action has been taken on the motion to lift the same
despite repeated requests. Respondent Judge Castro overlooked the fact that
transportation services are affected by a high degree of public <span class="GramE">interest,</span> hence, he should have resolved the pending motions
expeditiously and without delay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of remanding this case to the lower court, <span class="GramE">We</span> deem it wise to rule on the legality of the transfer
inasmuch as public interests demand the early disposition of the case. It
should be underscored that the transfer of the BOT offices from Gutierrez-David
Building to Sandoval Building was approved by the President.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The BOT Chairman, in proposing the transfer, and the Minister of Transportation
and Communications, in recommending the transfer to the President, must in the
very nature of things, be familiar with the facts, circumstances and problems
which necessitate the transfer. The reasons cited by BOT in transferring its
offices: to curb the activities of fixers, to insure security of its records,
to have a work area conducive to efficiency, to be near the Ministry of
Transportation of which BOT <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>a
part, are <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">valid ones </span>which private respondent can<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">not question for it deals purely with matters of administering the BOT
offices.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">other hand, it
admits of no </span>doubt that the President certainly had in his possession
the necessary information and data at the time he approved the transfer. Such
factual foundation cannot be defeated by private respondent's naked assertions
that the transfer is disadvantageous to the government and will cause untold
difficulties to the members of the association of private respondent which
incidentally is only a segment of the public dealing with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">BOT. </span>Furthermore, the determination of
whether the location of BOT offices will best serve the interest of the public
dealing with <span class="GramE">it,</span> lies within the discretion of the
President. Such discretionary power vested in the President <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>not subject to contrary judgment or
control of others, in the absence of arbitrariness and grave abuse. In general,
courts have no supervisory power over the actions of the administrative
department of the government like the BOT. This <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is </span>particularly true with respect to acts involving the exercise
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">judgment or discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Finally, it is apparent </span>that
private respondent, before seeking judicial intervention, should have pursued
their plea to the Ministry of Transportation and Communi­cations and eventually
to the President, remedies that are plain, speedy and adequate in the ordinary
cause of law. Plainly, private respondent did not exhaust this remedy. Settled <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>the rule that if a litigant goes to
court without first pursuing his administrative remedies, his action <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is </span>premature or he has no cause of
action to ventilate in court. His case <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is
</span>not ripe for judicial determination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
