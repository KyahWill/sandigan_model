<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sometime in October or
November, 1977, petitioner </span>contacted the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span>
persons and informed them that he could work out their claims for payment of
the values of their lots and/or improvements affected by the widening <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>said highway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the process, <span class="SpellE">Mejorada</span>
required the claimants to sign blank copies of the "Sworn Statement on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the C</span>orrect and Fair Market Value of
Real Properties" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span>"Agreement
to Demolish, Remove and Reconstruct improvements" pertinent to their
claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claimants compiled without
bothering to find out what the documents were all about as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">they </span>were only interested in the
payment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In said "Sworn
Statements" and "Agreements to Demolish" the value of the
respective properties of the claimants were </span>made to appear very much
higher than the actual value <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claimed by
them.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Likewise, the said
"Agreements to Demolish" reflected the value of the improvements
"as per assessor" which on the average was only P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
lower than the value declared by the owners in their sworn statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The value as per assessor was in turn
supported by the Declarations of Real Property in the </span>names <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the claimants containing an assessed value
exactly the same as that stated in the Agreements to Demolish as per
assessor", except the claims of De la Cruz and <span class="SpellE">Aran</span>
where </span>there is only a difference of P400.00 and P200.00, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respectively, it turned out, however, that
said </span>Declarations of Property are not really intended for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">claimants as trey were registered in the
names of other persons, thus showing that they were all falsified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A few months after
processing the claims, accused accompanied the claimants to the Office of the
Highway District Engineer at the provincial Capitol of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
Metro Manila, to receive payments and personally assisted the claimants in
signing the vouchers and <span class="SpellE">encashing</span> the checks by
certifying as to their identities and guaranteeing payment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Right after the claimants
had received the proceeds of their checks, accused accompanied them to his car
which was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">parked nearby where
they were divested of the amounts paid </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">them leaving only the
sum of P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to each except Isaac Carlos to whom
P5,000.00 was left, explaining to them </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">there were many who
would share in said amounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the
claimants were helpless to complain because they were afraid of the accused and
his armed companion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The claimants, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">through </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the assistance of counsel, filed their complaints with the Provincial <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> Office of </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Pasig</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner enumerated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">three
elements which in </span>his opinion constitute a violation of Section 3 (e).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">First</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">, </span>that the accused must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">be a public officer </span>charged with the
duty or granting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">licenses or permits or
other concessions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends
that inasmuch as he is not charged with the duty of granting licenses, permits
or other concessions, then he is not the officer contemplated by Section 3 (e).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Section 3 cited above
enumerates in eleven subsections the corrupt practices of any public officer
declared unlawful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its reference to
"any public officer" is without distinction or qualification and it
specifies the acts declared unlawful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
agree with the view adopted by the Solicitor General that the last sentence of
parag</span>raph<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (e) is intended to
make clear the inclusion of officers and employees of offices or government
corporations which under the ordinary concept of "public officers"
may not come within the term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a
strained construction of the provision to read it as applying exclusively to
public officers charged with the duty of granting licenses or permits or other
concessions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The first element,
therefore, of Section 3 (e) is that </span>the accused must be a public
officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This, the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
did not fail to allege.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Second</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">that such public officer caused undue injury to any party, including
the Government, or gave any private party unwarranted benefits, advantage or
preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial </span>functions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner denies that
there was injury or damage caused the Government because the payments were
allegedly made </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the basis of a document solely </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">made </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">by the Highway District Engineer to which petitioner had no hand in
preparing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact, however, is that
the government suffered undue injury as a result of the petitioner's </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">having </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">inflated the true claims of complainants which became the basis of the
report submitted by the Highway District </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">En</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">gineer to the Regional
Director of the Department of Highways</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and which eventually became
the basis of payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His contention
that he had no participation is belied by the fact that as a
right-of-way-agent, his duty was precisely to negotiate with property owners
who are affected by highway constructions for the purpose of compensating them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the part of the
complainants, the injury caused </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">them consists in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">their being divested of a large proportion of

bad faith </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">gross inexcusable negligence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner argues that
for the third element to be present, the alleged injury or damage to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">complainants </span>and the government must have been caused by the
public officer in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial
functions and inasmuch as when the damage was caused to the complainants, he
was no longer discharging his official administrative functions, therefore, he
is not liable for the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> established the fact that
the petitioner took advantage of his position as a right-of-way-agent by making
the claimants sign the aforementioned agreements to demolish and sworn
statements which contained falsified declarations of the value of the
improvements and lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was evident
bad faith on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">part </span>of the
petitioner when he inflated the values of the true claims and when he divested
the claimants of a large share of the amounts due them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above holding, <span class="GramE">We</span> also
dispose of the fourth issue which relates to the allegation that petitioner
cannot be convicted for a violation of the Anti-Graft Law because the evidence
adduced by the prosecution is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>not
the violation of Section 3 (e) but the crime of robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the petitioner's averment, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">variance
