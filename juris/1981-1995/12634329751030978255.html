<p class="BODY">Arraignment was set for 21 September 1987.  Upon a claim by counsel for the accused that
a motion for reconsideration was filed with the Office of the Provincial
Fiscal, the arraignment on that date was reset to 30 September 1987.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on 30 September 1987, the accused, with the

<p class="BODY">On 16 October 1987, trial on the merits commenced with the

However, before the prosecution could present its next witness, the defense, at
the hearing of 8 January 1988, moved that the accused be allowed to plead
guilty to the lesser offense defined in Section 6 of Republic Act No. 6425.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution then presented two (2) more witnesses:  P/Capt. Luena Layador, the forensic chemist
who examined the alleged marijuana specimens, and Pfc. Benjamin Feliciano, a
member of the buy-bust team.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his defense, the accused relied on his own testimony which he
sought to bolster with the testimonies of his mother, Remedios Fernandez, and
his grandfather, Eliseo Fernandez.</p>

<p class="BODY">After evaluating the evidence adduced by the parties, the trial
court promulgated on 25 November 1988 a decision finding the accused guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> </span>and
sentencing him:</p>

appeal.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution upon which the judgment of
conviction is based, is summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The suspected marijuana specimens (Exhibit "E" and
"E-1") were then referred to the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame,
Quezon City for laboratory examination through a letter-request dated August
20, 1987 (Exhibit "B").  After
conducting three (3) separate tests on the subject specimens, Forensic Chemist
P/Capt. Luena Layador declared in her Chemistry Report No. D-862-87 (Exhibits
"C" and "D") whereon she testified that the subject
specimens were positive for marijuana.  Meanwhile, P/Cpl. Jaime Navarro executed an Affidavit dated August 20,
1987 (Exhibit "DD") concerning the arrest of the accused herein.”<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The version for the defense is summarized by the trial court as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused, in his defense, vehemently denied the accusation
imputed against him.  He alleged that on
August 20, 1987 at about 11:30 a.m., he was washing his clothes at home when
suddenly two (2) men together with his cousin entered the yard of their house
looking for him.  When his cousin left,
the two (2) men immediately arrested him and charged him of (sic) selling
marijuana.  Then he was escorted by the
two (2) men upstairs and was asked to get his clothes since he was half-naked
at that time.  Right then and there he
saw the two (2) men placed (sic) something on top of the table of his room
which turned out to be marijuana.  His
mother who was with him in the house, likewise, saw the alleged frame-up.  Thereafter, he was brought to the police
headquarters where he was investigated and was finally detained."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 20, 1987 at about 8:00 o'clock in the morning,
P/Cpl. Jaime Navarro, the Officer-in-Charge of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the
Marikina Police Station, was tipped off by a civilian informer that a certain
Raul Fernandez was engaged in selling marijuana somewhere along Bonifacio
Avenue, Marikina, Metro Manila.  The
message was relayed to P/Capt. William Coronado, the Chief of the Special
Operations Group, who, in turn, directed said P/Cpl. Navarro and his men
composed of Pfc. Wilfredo Mendoza, Pfc. Wenceslao Miano (now deceased), Pfc.
Benjamin Feliciano and Pfc. Bello Birgueta to proceed to the area and to
conduct ‘buy-bust operation’ (sic) in order to apprehend the suspected
pusher.  P/Cpl. Navarro designated the
confidential informant (identity undisclosed) to act as poseur-buyer and gave
him a previously marked ten-peso bill (Exhibit "A") with instruction
to buy P10<span style="">.00 </span>pesos worth of
marijuana stuff from the suspect.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Arriving at the site of the operation, the confidential informant
went to see the suspected pusher while P/Cpl. Navarro and his men posted
themselves inconspicuously near the area where the suspect and the confidential
informer would meet.  At a distance of
about five (5) to six (6) meters, P/Cpl. Navarro was able to witness on (sic)
how the actual exchange of money and marijuana took place between the
confidential informant and the suspect, i.e., when the confidential informant
handed over the money to the suspect, the latter, left, entered the steel gate
of their house, came back a few minutes thereafter and delivered the marijuana
wrapped in an aluminum foil to the confidential informant.  The same incident was seen by the other
members of the team.  At this juncture,
the confidential informant made a pre-arranged signal to the back-up team
prompting P/Cpl. Navarro to close in and arrest the suspect (accused herein).  The latter was ordered to bring out the
contents of his pocket and there the ten-peso bill marked money was
confiscated.  With the cooperation and
permission of the accused, additional marijuana stuff this time contained in a
small white plastic bag was recovered from his room.  Accused was later brought to the Marikina Police Station and was
subjected to interrogation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error, the accused assails the
credibility of prosecution witnesses P/Cpl. Jaime Navarro and Pfc. Benjamin
Feliciano on the ground that their testimonies are full <span style="">of </span>inconsistencies especially with respect to the contents of
the aluminum foil which was allegedly taken from the accused, the identity of
the actual possessor thereof at the time of apprehension and the time the money
was delivered to the accused.  Pointing
to specific portions of the transcripts of the stenographic notes of their
testimonies, accused maintains that Navarro claimed that the aluminum foil
contained "marijuana fruiting tops." Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please describe to the Honorable
Court the marijuana which was sold by the accused and which was handed over by

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Upon the other hand, Feliciano stated

<p class="BODY">As to who was in actual possession of the marijuana at the time of
apprehension, accused zeroes in on the conflicting testimony on direct
examination of Navarro.  While
initially, Navarro declared that he apprehended the accused when the latter
"was about to give the marijuana to the poseur-buyer," he later
testified that when he held the hand of the accused, the marijuana was already
in the possession of the poseur-buyer.  Thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.  It
was established beyond any shadow of a doubt that the aluminum foil with its
contents of dried marijuana fruiting tops and the 2.18 grams of suspected dried
marijuana fruiting tops found in the room of the accused were delivered to the

The accused made no attempt to show that the seized articles were substituted
by the peace officers or that the findings of the PC Crime Laboratory Service
are incorrect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inconsistency brought about by the claim of Pfc. Feliciano
that what he saw were dried marijuana leaves is insignificant, for it raises a
discrepancy on a very minor matter.  Having established the contents of the aluminum foil to be marijuana, a
distinction between dried leaves and dried fruiting tops thereof became
irrelevant.  Marijuana embraces every
kind, class and character of the Indian hemp, whether dried or fresh, flowering
or fruiting tops of the <span style="">pistillate </span>plant
and all its geographic varieties in any form whatsoever.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled that discrepancies on minor matters do
not impair the essential integrity of the prosecution evidence as a whole or
reflect on the witnesses’ honesty.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> The
inconsistencies may be caused by the natural fickleness of memory, which even
tends to strengthen rather than weaken <span style="">the

Navarro who categorically stated that he saw from a distance of about five (5)
to six (6) meters the actual exchange of marijuana and money between the
accused and the confidential informant (TSN, October 16, 1987, pp. 4-5).  The said exchange was also witnessed by the
other members of the team.  (See
testimony of Pfc. Benjamin Feliciano, TSN, July 22, 1988, pp. 3-4).  Likewise, the marked money was recovered
from the accused himself.  And witness
P/Capt. Luena Layador, a forensic chemist, confirmed in her testimony and in
Chemistry Report No. D-962-87 that what was really sold by the accused was
marijuana.  All these are proof of the
sale of a prohibited drug punishable under Section 4, Article II of Republic
Act No. 6425, as amended."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither is there any inconsistency in the statements of P/Cpl.
Navarro regarding the possessor of the aluminum foil at the time the accused
was apprehended.  Accused clearly
misconstrued the import of the testimony of said witnesses by confining the
concept of apprehension to the actual laying of<span style=""> </span>Navarro's hand on the hand of the accused.  What appears clearly to this Court is that
Navarro decided to apprehend the accused <i>in</i><i><span style=""> </span></i><i><span style="">flagrante delicto</span></i><span style="">; </span>but, at the precise moment he was
able to hold the accused's hand, the latter had already reached the receiving
hand of the poseur-buyer who accepted the aluminum foil.  There was then a completed delivery of the
marijuana.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, whether or not the accused was still in possession
of the aluminum foil at the time Navarro held the former's hand is totally
immaterial.  For liability to attach

or transport any prohibited drug, or shall act as a broker in any of such
transactions.  If the victim of the
offense is a minor, or should a prohibited drug involved, in any offense under
this Section be the proximate cause of death of a victim thereof, the maximum
penalty herein provided shall be imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">it is not necessary that the seller
physically delivers the prohibited drug to the buyer or victim or that the
contract be consummated by the actual delivery of the subject matter to the buyer.  It is enough that there be a perfected
contract of sale.  There is perfection
of such a contract at the moment there is a meeting of minds upon the thing
which is the object of the contract and upon the price, from which moment the
parties may reciprocally demand performance, subject to the provisions of the
law governing the form of contracts.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> In

the peace officers recovered from him.  Up to that point then, the contract of sale had already been perfected,
even if the subject matter was not <i>licit</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> and
the accused already became liable as a seller under the above Section 4 of R.A.
No. 6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is as well no merit in the claim of the accused that the
non-presentation of the poseur-buyer as a witness is a clear suppression of
evidence.  The testimony of the
poseur-buyer, if it were given, would at best be corroborative because Navarro
and Feliciano sufficiently established how the crime was committed.  Thus, his non-presentation was not fatal to
the prosecution's case.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> Of
course, it would be different if the police officers were unable to see the
actual sale of marijuana.  In such a
situation, an exception arises and the poseur-buyer should be presented as a
witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, there is no showing in this case that the poseur-buyer was not
available for examination.  If the
accused honestly believed that the testimony of such poseur-buyer would be
adverse to the prosecution, the former should have availed of the compulsory
process to have such poseur-buyer produced as his witness, or even as a hostile
witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused's postulation regarding the improbability of his
committing the offense because it is contrary to human experience for a drug
pusher to sell to a total stranger merits no attention.  What matters is not the existing familiarity
between the buyer and the drug pusher, but rather their agreement and the acts
constituting the sale and delivery of the marijuana leaves.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, there is no evidence on record to show that the accused and the
poseur-buyer are strangers to each other.  The defense counsel did not press for the disclosure of the identity of
the latter or of his relationship with the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the accused's allegation that he was a victim of a
frame-up, We agree with the trial court that it deserves scant consideration:</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>charge<span style=""> </span>of alleged frame-up interposed by the accused
deserves scant consideration.  The
police officers as such are presumed to have regularly performed their duties
in the absence of evidence to the contrary (Rule 131, Section 5 (m), Rules of
Court).  From the attendant
circumstances, the Court sees no reason why the police officers would falsely
concoct a serious charge against accused herein if he really did not commit the
offense charged.  Absent a showing that
the police officers were actuated by improper motive, their testimonies are
entitled to full faith and credit (People vs. Patog, 144 SCRA 429)."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In several drugs cases, this Court has consistently held that
absent any proof to the contrary, law enforcers are presumed to have regularly
performed their duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> This
presumption perforce requires that the proof of the defense of frame-up must be
strong.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
For, as stated in <i>People vs. Agapito</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>"In cases involving persons accused of being drug pushers or
sellers, almost always the defense is that the accused was framed by the
apprehending officers.  We realize the disastrous
consequences on the enforcement of law and order, not to mention the well-being
of society, if the courts, solely on the basis of the policemen's alleged
rotten reputation, accept in every instance this form of defense which can be
so easily fabricated.  It is precisely
for this reason that the legal presumption, that official duty has been
regularly performed, exists."<span style="font-size: 7pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People vs. Del Pilar</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court was more emphatic in stressing that the defense of frame-up must be proved
by clear and convincing evidence because it is of the same category as
alibi.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"The defense of frame-up can undoubtedly be fabricated with
facility.  It must, therefore, be proved
by clear and convincing evidence.  Like
alibi, it is a weak defense that <span style="">is </span>easy
to concoct and is difficult to prove."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the second assigned error, accused contends that the
ten-peso bill and the marijuana recovered from him and from his room are
inadmissible in evidence for having been the product of an unlawful arrest and
search.  This is patently without
basis.  He was arrested while in the act
of selling marijuana to the poseur-buyer.  Section 5 (a), Rule 113 of the Rules of Court provides, that:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 5.  <i>Arrest</i>
<i>without</i> <i>warrant; when lawful.</i> -- A peace officer or a private
person, may, without warrant, arrest a person:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 1.8pt;">(a) When, in his presence, the person to
be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit
an offense;"<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Moreover, Section 12, Rule 126 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 12.  <i>Search
incident to lawful arrest.</i> -- A person lawfully arrested may be searched
for dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the commission
of an offense, without a search warrant."<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People </i><i><span style="">vs.
Paco</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Having caught <span style="">the </span>appellant
<i>in flagrante</i> as a result of the buy-bust operation, the policemen were
not only authorized but were also under obligation to apprehend the drug pusher
even without a warrant of arrest.  And
since the appellant's arrest was lawful, it follows that the search made
incidental to the arrest was also valid (Rule 126, Sec. 12; Alvero vs. Dizon,
76 Phil. 637 [1946]; People vs. Claudio, G.R. No. 72564, April 15, 1988)."<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, since the arrest without warrant was valid, then the
search of the accused as a consequence of such arrest was likewise valid.  The ten-peso bill and the marijuana obtained
from the search of the accused's body are, therefore, admissible in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the search of the accused's room cannot be considered as
incidental to his arrest because the arrest was made outside his house and
there is no valid reason to search his room.  Nevertheless, an examination of the record reveals that the accused
consented to the search of his room even without a warrant.  In fact, the trial court found that
"[W]ith the cooperation and permission of the accused, additional
marijuana stuff this time contained in a small white plastic bag was recovered
from his room."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, there is a clear waiver of the accused's right against unreasonable
searches and seizures making the marijuana found in his room likewise
admissible in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing disquisitions, there is no need to take <span style="">up </span>the third assigned error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affirmance then of the judgment of the trial court finding
the accused guilty of the crime charged is in order.  The penalty imposed, which is <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, with all
its accessory penalties is, however, incorrect.  It should be life imprisonment.  Section 4, Article II of Republic Act. No. 6425, as amended, provides
for the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from <s>P</s>20,000.00<span style=""> </span>to <s>P</s>30,000.00.  The penalty of <i><u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u></i><span style="">, </span>a penalty provided for in
appropriate cases under the Revised Penal Code and which carries accessory
penalties, is completely different from life imprisonment.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>
