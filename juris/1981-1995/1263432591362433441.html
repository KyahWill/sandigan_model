<p class="BODY">The original complaint in Civil Case No. 615, an action
instituted by petitioner against private respondents for annulment of title and
reconveyance with damages involving more than fifteen (15) hectares designated
as Lot No. 737 of the Himamaylan Cadastre located at Himamaylan, Negros Occidental,
was filed on 23 October 1972.  A third
amended complaint, impleading petitioner's mother, Sinforosa Flores, as
co-plaintiff, was filed on 8 February 1974.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> It is
alleged therein that Lot No. 737 was originally decreed and registered in the
names of petitioner Teodora Claverias and her brother Federico.  The latter died unmarried and without any
issue, leaving Sinforosa as his only heir.  They also alleged that the owner's copy of the original certificate of
title was lost during the last world war. However, after the war, private
respondent Adoracion Quingco, taking advantage of plaintiffs' illiteracy, had
the original title reconstructed in the name of petitioner Claverias and her
deceased brother.  Thereafter, through
fraud, Quingco had the said title cancelled and obtained a new certificate in
her name.  Subsequently, in connivance
with private respondent Tongson, she executed a fictitious and simulated deed
of sale of Lot No. 737 in favor of the latter and, by virtue thereof, a new
transfer certificate of title was issued in Tongson's name.  Subsequently, through force and
intimidation, Tongson succeeded in evicting petitioner and her mother from the
premises which they had been occupying until then.  It was only in 1968, upon verification with the Office of the
Register of Deeds of Bacolod City, that petitioner learned of these fraudulent
transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Amended Answer,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
private respondents alleged, <i><span style="">inter </span></i><i><span style="">alia, </span></i>that Lot No. 737 was twice
sold to their predecessors-in-interest by Sinforosa.  The first sale, which was with the petitioner's conformity, was
consummated on 22 January 1922 for a consideration of P300.00.  The second sale was executed by Sinforosa
and the petitioner on 30 June 1930 for P200.00.  In the settlement of the estate of Eustaquio Quingco, the lot was
adjudicated to respondent Adoracion Quingco who later sold it to respondent
Tongson; the latter had a new transfer certificate of title issued in his
name.  In 1958, Tongson filed an ejectment
case against petitioner; she lost this case.  Her subsequent appeal to the then Court of First Instance of Negros
Occidental was dismissed on 12 September 1967 for her failure to appear.  During the pendency of the ejectment case,
she filed an action for recovery of ownership with the Court of First Instance
of Negros Occidental which, however, was likewise dismissed on 29 October 1959
for failure to prosecute.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sinforosa died in 1980 during the pendency of Civil Case No. 615.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision dated 29 October 1984, the trial court overruled
the theory of fraud relied upon by petitioner on the ground that the facts
established do not support it; it then held that:  (a) the petitioner and her mother had in fact twice sold the
property in question to Venancia Alarcon de Quingco, mother of respondent
Adoration Quingco, as evidenced by Exhibits "17" and "18",
(b) petitioner's cause of action had prescribed or is barred by laches, and (c)
respondent Tongson is a buyer in good faith, hence, reconveyance cannot
prosper.  As to petitioner's claim that
Venancia Alarcon was a mere trustee, the trial court ruled that even granting
the existence of an implied trust, the action is likewise barred by
prescription.  The detailed disquisition
of the trial court on these points reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Be it remembered, however, that there are certain
uncontroverted evidence affecting Lot 737 proven by some well-founded
documentary evidence pertinent to and material to these transactions entered
into by the parties or their predecessors-in-interest prior to and subsequent
to the issuance of OCT No. RO-7111 (17502) proving:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(1) That OCT No.
RO-7111 (17502) was issued on <u>August</u> <u><span style="">6,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>1923</u>,
in the name of herein plaintiff, Teodora Claverias, and her <span style="">brother, Federico Claverias, during their
minority;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span style="">(2) </span>That Federico Claverias died in his
minority and was survived by his mother, Sinforosa Flores, and a sister,
Teodora Claverias;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(3) But, prior of
(sic) the issuance of OCT No. RO-7111 (17502), Sinforosa Flores, mother of
herein plaintiff, and the <span style="">plaintiff
herself, Teodora Claverias, executed a deed of </span>absolute sale on January
25, 1922, transferring and conveying the lot in question (Lot 737) to Venancia
Alarcon de Quingco (mother of defendant Adoracion Quingco) for and in <span style="">consideration of P300.00; (Exhibit
"17")<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;"><span style="">(4) </span>That after the death of Eustaquio
Quingco, husband of Venancia Alarcon de Quingco and father of defendant
Adoracion Quingco, his last will and testament was duly probated before the
Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental in his Spec. Proc. No. 4797
entitled 'Testate Wstate (sic) of the late Eustaquio Quingco,' wherein Lot 737
was included as part of the testate estate of the deceased, Eustaquio Quingco;
(Exhibits "5" and "5-A")</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(5) On June 19,
1930, due to the loss of the original deed of sale dated January 25, 1922,
another deed of absolute sale was executed by Sinforosa Flores and her
daughter, Teodora Claverias, and this time, with the marital consent of the
latter's spouse, Vicente Lomaques, involving the same property, subject matter
of Exhibit "17" in favor of the same buyers mentioned by the original
deed of sale.  (Exhibit "18")</p>

<p class="2Q">From the foregoing set of uncontroverted facts, the Court has no
other recourse but to draw a conclusion that as early as 1922 and 1930,
Sinforosa Flores and the plaintiff, Teodora Claverias, disposes (sic) of
whatever interests or rights they may have had on Lot 737, absolutely and
forever, unto to (sic) the predecessors-in-interest of the defendants
herein.  As matters stand, the deed of
sale was executed not only once but twice.  Hence, the plaintiff relinguished (sic) her rights over the property as
early as 1922 and again in 1930, evidenced by unassailable documents.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">It has been seen by the Court that in both instances the execution
of the documents of sale (Exhibits "17" and "18") came into
being with the active participation and intervention of duly commissioned
notaries public.  Retired Judge Vidal
Vallejera, 86 years old, testified in Court during its session on February 7,
1984, as to the genuineness and due execution of the document of sale executed
by Sinforosa Flores, her daughter, Teodora Claverias, with the marital consent
of the latter's spouse, Vicente Lomaques, on June 19, 1930.  (Exhibit "18").</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">In the absence of any other evidence worthy of trust, the ancient
documents marked as Exhibits "17" and "18" appear as the
best memorial of the transactions affecting Lot 737.  The Court is bereft of any Justifiable (sic) or cogent reason to
disturb its conclusion that in truth, the plaintiff disposed of her rights and
interests over Lot 737 several decades ago as proved by valid and authentic
documents of transfer.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The ownership of Adoration Quingco and her predecessors-in-interest
dates back to the year 1922 when the plaintiff and her mother sold and conveyed
Lot 737 in favor of Venancia Alarcon (Exhibit "17"), which conveyance
was confirmed on June 19, 1930, (Exhibit "18").  From that point in time until 1958,
plaintiff Teodora Claverias exerted no efforts to seek for (sic) the annulment
of several documents included in the proceedings (Spec. Proc. No. 4797).  It was only month (sic) later on, April 26,
1959, when the plaintiff made attempt (sic) to assail the validity of the
transactions had between the predecessors-in­-interest of the defendants and
the defendants themselves, and the plaintiff and her mother.  These are transactions that transpired
several decades ago, giving birth to several documents considered as ancient,
stamped with a 'tag' of trustworthiness.</p>

<p class="2Q">So that, even if it is assumed <i>arguendum </i>(sic), that indeed,
fraud attended the consummation of these transactions involving Lot 737, the
attempt by the plaintiff in this instant case to nullify these transactions can
no longer proper (sic).  Because upon the
facts proven, it is not difficult for this Court to conclude that the
plaintiff's cause of action, assuming that she ever had one, had prescribed at
the time she filed a suit on (sic) April 29, 1959, (Case No. 5295, CFI?<span style="">Negros Occidental).  And better still, the case under consideration because of laches,
the plaintiff may not now be allowed to assail the validity of the transactions
affecting Lot 737, much less the validity of the judicial proceedings in Spec.
Proc. No. 4797, entitled ‘Testate Estate of Eustaquio Quingco’ which resulted
in the </span><span style="">adjudication </span><span style="">of the property in question to the defendant,
Adoracion </span>Quingco.  (Godinez vs.
Pelaez, L-18491, February 27, 1971).</p>

<p class="2Q">Moreover, it has been also noted that on March 3, 1958, defendant
Adoracion Quingco, for and in consideration of the sum of Two Thousand Pesos
(P2,000.00), sold and conveyed Lot 737 by way of an absolute deed of sale to
her co-defendant Ernesto Tongson.  As a
result of the deed of sale, TCT No. T-23353 was issued by the Register of Deeds
of Negros Occidental in the name of Ernesto Tongson (Exhibit "3",
also Exhibit "C"), thereby cancelling TCT No. T-23275 in the name of
co-­defendant Adoracion Quingco.  (Exhibits "2" and "2-A").</p>

<p class="2Q">As matters stand now, Ernesto Tongson is the absolute owner of Lot
737.  Except for a series of real estate
mortgages executed by Ernesto Tongson in favor of the Philippine National Bank,
no other valid lien or encumbrances exists (sic) at the back of his title.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Having been obtained by way of a deed of absolute sale Lot 737 from
Adoracion Quingco whose title was absolutely free from any flaw or defect,
Ernesto Tongson, being a buyer of said Lot 737 for value and in good faith and
without prior notice of any right whatsoever than what the defendant, Adoracion
Quingco, had over Lot 737, deserves the full protection of the law.  (Godinez <span style="">vs. </span>Pelaez, L-18491, February 27, 1971).  Said defendant then acquired title to Lot
737 as an innocent purchaser for value as early as 1958 and such being the
situation, the rights and interests of defendant Ernesto Tongson over the lot
in question must be set at rest since reconveyance as desired by the plaintiff
can no longer prosper in this case, the land having passed on to an innocent
purchaser for value.  (Lazia vs. Donting,
L-55911-R, February 25, 1977).”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In her appeal from this adverse judgment to the respondent Court

CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of 22 July 1986, the respondent Court sustained
the trial court and affirmed its decision.  It held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"We agree, Against the notarized documents of absolute sale,
Exhibits "17" and "18", evidencing Teodora Claverias’
absolute alienation of Lot 737, her mere denials to the contrary are completely
unavailing.  The rule is settled.</p>

<p class="3Q">'A notarial document, guaranteed by public attestation in
accordance with the law, must be sustained in full force and effect so long as
he who impugns it shall not have presented strong, complete, and conclusive
proof of its falsity or nullity on account of some flaw or <span style="">defect provided by law.' (Robinson vs.
Villafuerte, 18 Phil. 171).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">And to further accentuate the bankruptcy of the plaintiff's
position, the defendants-appellees even presented the notary public who
notarized one of the deeds of sale to testify to its validity.</p>

<p class="3Q">‘The testimony of a notary public, who is at the same time a
lawyer, must be given more credence to (sic) the testimony of a party denying a
contract acknowledged before the same notary public.' (Cabahug vs. Cinco,
CA-G.R. No. 6042, February 3, 1941)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Even granting for the sake of argument the veracity of Teodora
Claverias' claim of fraud -- that she never executed those deeds of sale and
her mother merely <u>entrusted</u> the lot to Venancia Alarcon Quingco in 1922
-- ­then, still, her claim should be barred on the ground of prescription.  Whether express or implied, this alleged
trust was openly <span style="">repudiated in 1937
when Lot 737 was included as part of the late Eustaquio Quingco's estate in
Spec. Proc. No. 4797, wherein the probate court duly approved the project of
partition adjudicating to appellee Adoracion Quingco the ownership of this lot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The record further discloses this action of the probate court was
not the only judicial rebuff suffered by the appellants in relation to the land
subject of herein case.  Sometime in
1958, defendant-appellee Ernesto Tongson instituted an ejectment case against
Teodora Claverias and her husband (Civil Case 268) before the Municipal Court
of Himamaylan, Negros Occidental.  The
court found for the plaintiff and ordered Teodora Claverias ejected from the
land.  On appeal to the then Court of
First Instance of Negros Occidental, her appeal therein was dismissed on
September 12, 1967 'for lack of interest and for failure of the appellants to
appear.'</p>

<p class="2Q">Again, in her first attempt to annul the defendants-appellee's
title (filed on April 29, 1959), the case was dismissed by the lower court for
repeated failure of Teodora Claverias and her husband to appear and prosecute
the action.</p>

<p class="2Q">The repeated wavering of the herein appellants in those previous
cases to prosecute their claim of ownership raises serious doubts in Our minds
as to the merits of their claim, else why the marked reluctance to press
matters to a conclusion until (sic) now?  Be that as it may, considering the legal documents of transfer and ownership
possession by the appellees over the land in dispute, the challenged (sic)
posed by the appellants must necessarily be rejected for lack of merit."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents failed to present the original deed of sale
and do not claim that they did.  No
justification has been adduced to show why they could not produce the original
or the duplicate originals thereof.  Indeed, serious doubt surrounds the existence of said deed of sale.  Moreover, there is no showing that the same
had been registered.  The reconstituted
Original Certificate of Title No. RO-7111 (17502)<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
does not carry any entry regarding the said sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Exhibit "18" is not <span style="">a </span>deed of sale.  It is but a certification of an entry in the
notarial register of notary public Vallejera.  The certification states that <span style="">"<u>no</u>
</span><u>copy</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>above-mentioned</u> <u>document</u> <u><span style="">has</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>been</u> <u>received</u> <u>by</u> <u>this</u> <u>office</u>
<u>for</u> <u>file</u>." It was, therefore, erroneous for both the trial
and the respondent appellate courts to declare that it is a deed of sale.  While the certification may be taken as evidence
that sometime in the past the notary public did make that entry in his notarial
book, the entry is neither a substitute for the document, nor the best evidence
thereof.  In this regard, private
respondents again failed to show why they could not produce the best
evidence.  The testimony of the notary
public that the document was acknowledged before him was insufficient to prove
the contents thereof.  We also note that
aside from the fact that this so-called sale was not registered, no entry
relating thereto appears in the reconstituted Original Certificate of Title.</p>

<p class="BODY">This error of the trial court was compounded by its sweeping
pronouncement that the deeds of sale of 25 January 1922 and 19 June 1930 are
"ancient documents" and "appear <span style="">as </span>the best memorial of the transactions affecting Lot
737," and so, therefore, <span style="">"x x
x </span>[t]he Court is bereft of any justifiable or cogent reason to disturb
its conclusion that in truth, the plaintiff disposed of her rights and interest
over Lot 737 several decades ago as proved by valid and authentic documents of
transfer."</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the failure of private respondents to produce the
original of the alleged deeds of sale, this Court cannot accept the said
pronouncement.  An <u><span style="">ancient</span></u><span style=""> <u>document</u>, </span>under the Rules on Evidence, refers to a
private document which is more than thirty (30) years old, produced from a
custody in which it would naturally be found if genuine, and is unblemished by
alterations or circumstances of suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, private respondents themselves never introduced and offered
in evidence Exhibits "17" and "18" as private
documents.  On the contrary, they
insisted that the same <span style="">are </span>public
documents.  <span style="">Besides, </span>even if they could be considered private documents,
private respondents still failed to prove the two (2) essential requisites
before an ancient document may be admitted without proof of its execution or
authenticity, to wit:  (a) it is
produced from a custody in which it would naturally be found if genuine and (b)
it <span style="">is </span>unblemished by any
alterations or circumstances of suspicion.  Both requisites presuppose the production of the original document,
something which private respondents failed to do.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Even granting for the sake of argument that Exhibit
"17" was correctly admitted and truly reflects what it purports to
show, the "sale" evidenced therein by Sinforosa Flores of Lot No. 737
is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot No. 737 originally belonged to Sinforosa's husband, Cornelio
Claverias, who died intestate.  Cornelio's two (2) children, petitioner herein and Federico, inherited
the property pursuant to Articles 930 and 932 of the Civil Code of Spain, the
governing law at that time, subject, however, to Sinforosa's right of usufruct
over one-third (1/3) of the property pursuant to Articles 834 and 835 of the
same Code.  These articles provide:</p>

<p class="2Q">"ARTICLE 930.  Succession pertains, in the first place, to the descending direct line.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">ARTICLE 932.  <span style="">The children </span>of the deceased shall
always inherit from him in their own right, dividing the inheritance in equal
shares.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">ARTICLE 834.  A widower or
widow who, on the death of his or her spouse, is not divorced, or should be so
by the fault of the deceased, shall be entitled to a portion in usufruct equal
to that corresponding by way of legitime to each of the legitimate children or
descendants who have not received any betterment.</p>

<p class="2Q">If only one legitimate child or descendant survives, the widower or
widow shall have the usufruct of the third available for betterment, such child
or descendant to have the naked ownership until, on the death of the surviving
spouse, the whole title is merged in him.</p>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">ARTICLE 835.  The hereditary
portion allotted in usufruct to the widowed spouse must be taken from the third
of the estate available for the betterment of the children.”<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, this usufructuary right covered one-sixth (1/6) of
the one-half (1/2) share of petitioner and one-sixth (1/6) of the other half
pertaining to Federico.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably with these provisions, the Original Certificate of
Title (OCT) No. 17502, reconstituted as OCT No. RO-7111 (17502), was issued on
10 July 1923 in the name of "TEODORA CLAVERIAS and FEDERICO CLAVERIAS”,
and made subject to the liens therein stated, the second of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x x x (b) that the land above-described is subject to the
usufructuary right of Sinforosa Flores during her natural life."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Sinforosa Flores could not have,
therefore, sold or encumbered <u>the</u> <u>lot</u>.  She could have disposed of or encumbered only her usufructuary
right thereon.  However, when Federico
Claverias, a co-owner of the property, together with the petitioner, died
without any issue, Sinforosa inherited his one-half (1/2) share of the lot
pursuant to Articles 935 and 936 of the Civil Code of Spain, which read:</p>

<p class="2Q">"ARTICLE 935.  In
default of legitimate children and descendants of the deceased, his ascendants
shall inherit from him, to the exclusion of collaterals.</p>

<p class="2Q">ARTICLE 936.  The father and
mother, if living, shall inherit share and share alike.</p>

<p class="2Q">Should one only of them survive, he or she shall succeed to the
entire estate of the child.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In addition to her ownership of one-half
(1/2) of the property, Sinforosa retained her usufructuary right over one-sixth
(1/6) of the portion pertaining to herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no competent evidence as to the date of death of
Federico.  It can, however, be safely
presumed that he died after the issuance of OCT No. 17502 on 10 July 1923
because his name is still mentioned therein as a co-owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, if indeed a deed of sale (Exh. "17") was
in fact executed on 25 January 1922, Sinforosa could sell only her usufructuary
right over one-third (1/3) of the entire lot.  The sale was null and void in respect to the lot because she was not its
owner.  Assuming for the sake of
argument that another deed <span style="">of </span>sale
was executed on 19 June 1930, as indicated by Exhibit "18", Sinforosa
could have only validly sold the one-half (1/2) portion of Lot No. 737 which
she inherited from Federico and her usufructuary right over one-sixth (1/6) of
the share of petitioner, but not the latter's share.  Nevertheless, if indeed Sinforosa signed the deed of sale dated
19 June 1930, this Court would find it difficult to accept any explanation as
to why the consideration indicated therein for the entire lot was merely
P200.00 when Sinforosa's usufructuary right was sold eight (8) years earlier <span style="">(Exh. "17") </span>for
P300.00.  It cannot be said that this
P200.00 was merely an additional sum because the vendee in the second sale is
Sixto Vallejera and not Venancia Alarcon, th<span style="">e</span> vendee in the first sale.  There is absolutely no competent evidence to prove that, as again
erroneously ruled by the trial court, Sixto purchased the property for
Venancia's or her husband's estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">3. No further ratiocination is needed to show the grave error
committed by both the trial court and the respondent Court when they concluded
that petitioner herein also sold her rights over the lot in the deed of sale of
25 January 1922, or that it is the "first" deed of sale she executed.  Exhibit "17" itself, the very
document relied upon by said courts, does not show that petitioner is one of
the vendors.  It is only Sinforosa
Flores who is shown to be the vendor.  Thus, it states:</p>

<p class="2Q">"<i>Yo, Sinforosa Flores, viuda, mayor de edad y vecina del
Municipio de Himamaylan, Negros Occidental, L.F., hago constar que, en
consideracion a la cantidad de TRES CIENTOS PESOS, moneda filipina, que he
recibido antes de ahora a mi entera satisfaction de la Sra. Venancia Alarcon de
Quingco, x x </i><i><span style="">x </span>VENDO,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petitioner's participation appears to
be limited to the mere affixing of her signature below the word <i><span style="">CONFORMES</span></i><span style="">.  </span>This <span style="">"<i>conforme</i>" </span>could mean
nothing more than her <u>conformity</u> to the sale of the usufructuary rights
of Sinforosa.  It cannot be legally
construed as petitioner's sale of her rights in the lot, or of her conformity
to the sale thereof by Sinforosa for the latter is not its owner; the <i><u><span style="">conforme</span></u></i><i><span style=""> </span></i>did not operate to vest on
Sinforosa ownership over the lot since it can by no means be considered a mode
of acquiring ownership.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the findings of the courts below, private respondent
Tongson is not a buyer in good faith.  He bought the property on 3 March 1958.  Good faith and the exercise of due diligence required him to demand from
the vendor the production of the certificate of<span style=""> </span>title.  The vendor was
then in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. 17502 since it was
not yet reconstituted.  The
reconstituted title was issued only on <u>4</u><span style=""> <u>Mar</u></span><u><span style="">c</span></u><u><span style="">h</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">19</span>58.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, at the time Tongson allegedly purchased the property, he knew, or ought
to have known, that his vendor was not the registered owner of the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the entries in the reconstituted Original
Certificate of Title (Exh. "A") also show that it was only on 31
March 1958 that it was cancelled upon the order of the court and a new one,
Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-23275, was issued in the name of private
respondent Adoracion Quingco.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing notwithstanding, laches had definitely foreclosed
the petitioner's right to recover the property.  In this regard, We are in full agreement with the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although petitioner was the owner of one-half (1/2) of Lot No.
737, she never possessed the same.  She
attempted to enter into possession of a portion thereof in 1958, but was
rebuffed by <span style="">an action for ejectment
filed by private respondent </span><span style="">Tongson,
</span><span style="">who </span>won said case.  She lost in her appeal filed thereafter;
during the pendency of the same, a writ of execution was issued against her in
1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, by her own inaction or through her own fault,
likewise lost in her bid in 1959 to secure the annulment of the titles issued
in the names of private respondents Quingco and Tongson.  The case she filed for that purpose was dismissed
on 29 October 1959.  Thus, even if
Tongson may not be considered a purchaser in good faith, the adverse possession
of his predecessor-in-interest from 1922 to 1958, totalling 36 years, benefited
him for purposes of applying the principle of laches.  Added to this is petitioner's failure to take any further action
to recover the property from the dismissal of the annulment case in 1959 until
23 October 1972, when she filed the original complaint in Civil Case No.
615.  Verily, she had slept too long.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prescription does not operate against her as she is the
registered co-owner of Lot No. 737.  Per
Section 46 of the Land Registration Act, no title to registered land in
derogation to that of the registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or
adverse possession.  Laches does.  In <i><span style="">Mejia

this Court defines laches and distinguishes it from prescription, thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">"'Laches' has been defined as 'such neglect or omission to
assert a right, taken in conjunction with lapse of time and other circumstances
causing prejudice to an adverse party, as will operate as a bar in equity.' It
is a delay in the assertion of a right 'which works disadvantage to another'
because of the 'inequity founded on some change in the condition or relations
of the property or parties.' It is based on public policy which, for the peace
of society, ordains that relief will be denied to a stale demand which
otherwise could be a valid claim.  It is
different from and applies independently of prescription.  While prescription is concerned with the
fact of delay, laches is concerned <span style="">with
the effect of delay.  Prescription is
concerned with the effect of delay.  Prescription is a matter of time; laches is principally a question of
inequity of permitting a claim to be enforced, this inequity being founded on
some change in the condition of the property or the relation of the
parties.  Prescription is statutory;
laches is not.  Laches applies in
equity, whereas prescription applies at </span>law.  <span style="">Prescription is based on
a fixed time, laches is not." (footnotes are omitted)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, both the trial court and the respondent Court correctly
applied prescription insofar as petitioner's claim of implied trust <span style="">is </span>concerned.  It is now settled that an action based on an
implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten (10) years,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
