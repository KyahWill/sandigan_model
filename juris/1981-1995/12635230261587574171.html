The question raised in the petition is whether respondent Minister of 
Justice committed grave abuse of discretion in directing the Provincial 
Fiscal of Camarines Sur "to desist from filing in court the 
corresponding informations against respondents based on your resolution,
 or to move for their dismissal if they have already been filed, and to 
thereafter dismiss the twin complaints filed in your office under I.S. 
Nos. 1162 and 1163, reporting the action you have taken on this 
directive within ten days from receipt hereof." (p. 35, <em>Rollo</em>)
<p>
The facts of this case are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
  Herein petitioner, Tomasa Vda. de Jacob, filed with the Office of the 
Provincial Fiscal of Camarines Sur two (2) criminal complaints for 
falsification of public documents which purport to have been executed by
 her deceased husband, Dr. Alfredo E. Jacob, to wit:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "(1)    A Deed of Absolute Sale dated December 2, 1977 over a 
parcel of residential land situated in the Poblacion, Municipality of 
Tigaon, Province of Camarines Sur, in favor of Jorge M. Centenera.  This
 deed was ratified on the same date before Notary Public Teodoro Alarcon
 and had for instrumental witnesses Pablo Paqueo, Jr. and Amelia Lamit. 
 This is the subject of I.S. No. 1162. </p>
    <p> "(2)    A Deed of Absolute Sale dated October 20, 1976 conveying
 ownership of 454,987 square meters of agricultural land situated at 
Barrio Mabalodbalod, Municipality of Tigaon, Province of Camarines Sur 
to Dr, Daniel Mercado and Dr. Alfredo V. Silva.  This deed was ratified 
on October 25, 1976 before Notary Public Jose Cea and had as 
instrumental witnesses, Miguel Moll and Olympio Clapis.  While this deed
 is the only one involved in I.S. No. 1163, records show that sometime 
there­after, on January 24, 1977, Dr. Jacob appears to have executed 
another deed of sale covering the same parcel of land to Daniel Mercado 
only.  This deed was ratified on the same date before the same Notary 
Public, Jose Cea." (pp. 32-33, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
In charging herein private respondents, namely:  Jorge Centenera, 
Teodoro Alarcon, Pablo Paqueo, Jr., Amelia Lamit, Alfredo Silva, Jose 
Cea, Miguel Moll and Olympio Clapis, with falsification of public 
documents, petitioner Tomasa Vda. de Jacob who, since January 16, 1979, 
had been the court-appointed guardian of the then incompetent Dr. 
Alfredo Jacob, claims that respondents connived and confederated with 
each other in falsifying the two deeds of absolute sale afore­mentioned 
by making it appear therein that her husband participated in the 
execution thereof as seller when in truth and in fact he never did so 
participate in any manner as he was already seriously ill and 
practically bed ridden on October 20, 1976 and December 2, 1977 when the
 said documents appeared to have been executed.
</p><p>
After preliminary investigation, Assistant Provincial Fiscal Ceferino P.
 Goce, on May 15, 1979, issued separate resolutions in I.S. Nos. 1162 
and 1163 recommending the filing in court of the corresponding 
informations "for falsification of public documents by private 
individuals as defined and punished under Article 171, par. 2 in 
relation to Article 172, par. 1 of the Revised Penal Code x x x." (p. 
46, <em>Rollo</em>)
</p><p>
The private respondents appealed the aforementioned resolutions to the 
respondent Minister of Justice, who, on April 15, 1981, directed the 
Provincial Fiscal to desist from filing in court the corresponding 
informa­tions against the respondents.  Reasons for this directive are -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "While the three medical cer­tificates submitted in evidence tend 
to indicate that Dr. Alfredo Jacob underwent medical treatment since 
1975 for arteriosclerosis and Parkin­son's disease, these could not be 
considered weighty enough to give credence to the claim that Dr. Jacob 
could not have been at Camarines Sur on December 2, 1977 to execute the 
Deed of Absolute Sale involved in I.S. No. 1162.  There is no showing 
that he was no longer ambulatory and mobile while undergoing treatment. </p>
  <p> "In this regard, it will be noted that the descriptive portion of 
the Medical Certificate issued by Dr. Rodolfo Talag indicating the weak 
physical condition of the patient and the uncoordinated movements of his
 legs has reference to the physi­cal condition of Dr. Jacob at the time 
of examination immediately prior to the issuance of the medical 
certi­ficate on March 18, 1978.  This observation is amply fortified by 
the suggestion in the medical certificate that the patient undergo 
immediate hospitalization.  It in no way reflects the patient's state of
 health on December 2, 1977 when he executed one of the Deeds of 
Absolute Sale in question. </p>
  <p> "Also, there is nothing in the medical certificates issued by 
three different doctors that would suggest that Dr. Alfredo Jacob could 
not have been in Camarines Sur on October 20 when he executed the Deed 
of Absolute Sale subject matter of I.S. No. 1163.  The medical 
certificates do not indicate that he was confined or was under 
treat­ment from May 31, 1976 when he was dis­charged from the hospital 
after a cardio-vascular clearance to the date when the deed of October 
20, 1976 was executed. </p>
  <p> "Moreover, the categorical declara­tions of the instrumental 
witnesses and Notary Public Teodoro Alarcon who re­spectively 
participated in the execution of the deeds in question, to the effect 
that Dr. Jacob actually and personally executed the Deed of Absolute 
Sale referred to cannot simply be overcome by the aforementioned medical
 certifi­cates, most especially in the absence of corroborating evidence
 tending to show in definite and precise terms that Dr. Jacob was 
actually not in Camarines Sur on the dates of the execution of the deeds
 in question.  Complainant herself could not qualify to assert this fact
 considering that on the dates of the execution of the said documents 
she was not yet married to Dr. Jacob. </p>
  <p> "Besides, even without the afore­mentioned declarations of the 
instrumental witnesses and notary public, the medical certificates, 
standing alone, which raise merely assumptions cannot destroy the 
presumption of regularity in the execu­tion of documents. </p>
  <p> "In their totality, we are of the opinion that the evidence on hand cannot sustain a <em>prima facie</em> case of falsifica­tion of public documents against respondents in both cases." (pp. 33-34, <em>Rollo</em>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The first and second motions for reconsideration of the aforementioned 
order of respondent Minister of Justice were denied.  Hence, this appeal
 by certiorari, petitioner arguing that respondent Minister "has 
transcended his authority to merely determine the existence of a <em>prima facie</em>
 case in pursuance of P.D. No. 911 and in so doing arrogated to himself 
the prerogatives or power vested in the courts." (pp. 28-29, <em>Rollo</em>)
</p><p>
It is apparent from the facts above-stated that <em>certiorari </em>does not lie.
</p><p>
The power of supervision and control by the Minister of Justice over the
 fiscals cannot be denied.  As stated in Noblejas vs. Salas, 67 SCRA 47,
 "Section 79(c) of the Revised Administrative Code defines the extent of
 a department secretary's power.  The power of control therein 
contemplated 'means (the power of the department head) to alter, modify 
or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the 
performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former 
for that of the latter.' 'The power of control … implies the right of 
the President (and, naturally, of his alter ego) to interfere in the 
exercise of such discretion as may be vested by law in the officers of 
the national government, as well as to act in lieu of such officers.'" 
For, while it is the duty of the fiscal to prosecute persons who, 
according to evidence received from the complainant, are shown to be 
guilty of a crime, the Minister of Justice is likewise bound by his oath
 of office to protect innocent persons from groundless, false or serious
 prosecution.  He would be committing a serious dereliction of duty if 
he orders or sanctions the filing of an information based upon a 
complaint where he is not convinced that the evidence would warrant the 
filing of the action in court.  As he has the power of supervision and 
control over prosecuting officers, the Minister of Justice has the 
ultimate power to decide which as between conflicting theories of the 
complainant and the respondents should be believed.  "It should be 
realized that when a man is haled to court on a criminal charge, it 
brings in its wake problems not only for the accused but for his family 
as well.  Therefore, it behooves a prosecutor to weigh the evidence 
carefully and to deliberate thereon to determine the existence of <em>prima facie</em>
 case before filing the information in Court.  Anything less would be a 
dereliction of duty (Bernardo vs. Mendoza, 90 SCRA 214)."
</p><p>
The remedy of complainant in a case where the Minister of Justice would 
not allow the filing of a criminal complaint against an accused because 
it is his opinion that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain an 
information for the complaint with which the respondents are charged of,
 is to file a civil action as indicated in Article 35 of the Civil Code,
 which provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Art. 35.  When a person, claiming to be injured by a criminal 
offense, charges another with the same, for which no independent civil 
action is granted in this Code or any special law, but the justice of 
the peace finds no reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been 
committed, or the prosecuting attorney refuses or fails to institute 
criminal proceedings, the complainant may bring a civil action for 
damages against the alleged offender.  Such civil action may be 
supported by a preponderance of evidence.  Upon the defendant's motion, 
the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to indemnify the 
defendant in case the complaint should be found to be malicious. </p>
  <p> "If during the pendency of the civil action, an information should
 be presented by the prosecuting attorney, the civil action shall be 
suspended until the ter­mination of the criminal proceedings."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Further, Presidential Decree No. 911 specifically provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> " x x x Provided, Finally, That whore the resolution of the 
Provincial or City Fiscal or the Chief State Prosecutor is, upon review,
 reversed by the Secretary (now Minister) of Justice, the latter may, 
where he finds that no <em>prima facie</em> case exists, authorize and 
direct the investigating fiscal concerned or any other fiscal or state 
prosecutor to cause or move for the dismissal of the case, or, where he 
finds a <em>prima facie</em> case, to cause the filing of an information
 in court against the respondent, based on the same sworn statement or 
evidence submitted, without the necessity of conducting another 
preliminary investigation."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.
SO ORDERED.
