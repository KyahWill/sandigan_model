				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> of a decision of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. CV 63806 dated <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1987</st1:date> and its resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="7">July 21, 1988</st1:date> involving a certain
property located in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Panay</span></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The record shows that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Development
Co., Inc. (PDCI for short) is the owner of Lot No. 3247 under TCT No. 12651 of
the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and declared for taxation purposes under Tax Declaration No. 5859.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Said lot originally belonged to Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> who assigned the same to PDCI for and in
consideration of her 2,680 shares valued at P26,800.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>her contribution to its capital stocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Voting Trust Certificate No. 6 in the
name of Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span>
shows that as of <st1:date year="1940" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1940</st1:date>
she deposited 2,680 shares of stocks with PDCI and that Stock Certificate No. 8
discloses that she is the owner of 2,680 shares of capital stocks of said
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is also reflected in
the Stock and Transfer Book of PDCI.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1940" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1940</st1:date>,
PDCI entered into a management contract with the National Food Products
Corporation (NFPC) whereby the latter agreed to finance the construction, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">maintenance, management and operation of the
fishponds of PDCI and NFPC gave loans and advances necessary <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
security for the payment of said loan, PDCI executed a real estate mortgage on
all its properties in favor of NFPC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Among the properties given as collateral was </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lot</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> No. 3247, formerly belonging to Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> and covered by TCT </span>No.
R0-4331 (17921) of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
which contains an annotation stating that the same was transferred and assigned
in favor of PDCI and <span class="SpellE">mortaged</span> to NFPC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said original certificate of title was later
cancelled by TCT No. 12651 in the name of PDCI.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NFPC was later abolished under Executive Order No. 372,
series of 1950, and petitioner Board of Liquidators (Board for short) was
created to liquidate and settle its affairs and dispose of its properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="12">December
 13, 1972</st1:date> petitioner Board executed with the PDCI a contract of
amicable settlement whereby petitioner PDCI agreed to pay the Board the sum of
P170,000.00 in full settlement of its mortgage obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Board agreed to assist PDCI in
ejecting the squatters in the premises and to deliver the certificates of title
covering the property as well as the records pertinent thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said contract of amicable settlement was
approved by the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> was found
illegally occupying said lot so petitioner PDCI demanded that he vacate the
premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PDCI also informed the Board
of its predicament upon refusal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
to vacate the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners
filed an action for recovery of possession with preliminary mandatory
injunction and damages against respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
among others, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
docketed under Civil Case No. V3685.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the complaint respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> claims that petitioners have no cause of action as he
acquired the property by legal means and having been in public, peaceful and
uninterrupted possession in good faith in the concept of owner for more than
ten (10) years and that the title thereto of petitioner PDCI has already been
lost by reason of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> and prescription.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, on July 19, 1977 the trial court rendered a
decision declaring PDCI the legal owner of the land in question and entitled to
its possession and usufruct thereof and to whatever improvements, and ordering
respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> as well as the spouses <span class="SpellE">Consolacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayot</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> to vacate
and turn over possession, improvements, and usufruct of said Lot No. 3247 to
PDCI and to pay the costs.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied therewith respondent <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
appealed to the Court of Appeals wherein in due course a decision was rendered
on <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1987</st1:date>
reversing the appealed decision and rendering another judgment insofar as Lot
No. 3247 is concerned without any pronouncement as to damages and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since it is not disputed that petitioner PDCI is the titled owner
of Lot No. 3247 having acquired the same by assignment from its owner Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> for and in
consideration of her subscription to shares of capital stocks in the PDCI,
petitioner PDCI is therefore the absolute owner of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if, as claimed by respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> had subsequently executed a quitclaim, deed and
donation of said property in favor of her brothers and sisters who in turn
allegedly verbally <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">sold </span>the same
to respondent, such subsequent disposition is of no legal effect whatsoever
inasmuch as Maria has no more right or title whatever over the property in
question to convey to her brothers and sisters including respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if
it may be true that respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> had been in
actual possession of the property in question for more than ten (10) years, the
registered title of the petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">PDCI </span>over
the property cannot be lost by prescription or <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
as respondent claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the contrary, what is obvious is that respondent <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> was in bad faith when he allegedly acquired said
property as he knew and should have known that as early as 1940 the same had
already been assigned by his sister Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">PDCI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The assignment was duly registered and
annotated on the Original Certificate of Title of Maria on the basis of which
Transfer Certificate of Title was issued in the name of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">PDCI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Such annotation and
issuance of title is notice to the whole world including respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the respondent that the assignment to
petitioner PDCI was only an assignment in trust so that his sister Maria still
remained to be the owner of the same property, the title being held in trust by
petitioner PDCI, is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, what appears from the record is that the assignment was not a mere
assignment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>trust but an
assignment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the entire property
in consideration of the shares of stocks that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Maria acquired </span>from the PDCI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, since what appears to have been conveyed by Maria to her
brothers and sisters was no longer her property, the quit claim, deed and
donation that she executed are null and void.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As a matter of fact even prior to said conveyance, the property had been
mortgaged by PDCI to the NFPC who is certainly a mortgagee in good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the alleged verbal sale executed by the <span class="SpellE">donees</span> brothers and sisters of Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> in favor of respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
is also null and void not only because they had no title to convey but also
because the sale of the land, which is verbal, and the presentation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>which was timely objected to, are
not enforceable under the statute of frauds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not a valid sale, and is inadmissible in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Note must be taken of paragraph 4 of the quitclaim, deed and
donation allegedly executed by Maria,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein it is stated "that Maria <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> <span class="SpellE">Lisao</span> desires to donate the land or its equivalent share of
stocks that the PDCI may issue in acceptance thereof x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>," Obviously, private respondent knew of the
transfer of the said lot to PDCI in consideration of its shares of stocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The quitclaim, deed and donation was executed
only in 1952 long after the property was assigned to PDCI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said document was not even registered in the
office of the Register of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, therefore, erred in considering PDCI to have registered the
property in its name in bad faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the whole therefore, the Court finds that respondent <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> has no leg to stand on to support his claim of
ownership and possession of the land in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals dated
December 29, 1987 and its resolution dated July 21, 1988, are hereby SET ASIDE
and another judgment is hereby rendered reinstating the judgment of the lower
