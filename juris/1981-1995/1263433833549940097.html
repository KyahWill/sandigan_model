				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners fault the respondent court for reversing the
dismissal of a complaint by the trial court and remanding the case for further
proceedings.  However, there is an
important antecedent question we must first resolve before we can go to the
merits of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts relevant to this petition are briefly narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 12, 1976, the Crisologo family donated an island to
the Sent of God Foundation on the condition <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> that it
would “be used exclusively to provide a monastic life and experience according
to the Rule of St. Benedict and for such other religious and charitable
purposes as may be determined by the donee.” This was followed by a later
donation of other lands, under the same conditions.  The subject properties were later transferred by the Foundation
to the S of G Foundation Inc., which introduced improvements thereon that, for
reasons we do not need to examine here, it later demolished.  On July 29, 1988, believing that the
conditions of the donations had been violated, the Crisologos filed a complaint
for revocation of the donations and the recovery of the properties donated.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Impleaded as defendants were the Sent of God Foundation, the S of G Foundation,
Inc., Raul G. Fores, Senen F. Valero, and Father Odon de Castro, the last three
as officers of the foundations.  Also
included were Olegario Orbeta and his wife, Susana Rosario Orbeta, for their
role in facilitating the donations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the first-named defendants resisted the
allegations in the complaint and denied that the conditions of the donations
had been violated.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
For their part, the Orbeta spouses confessed judgment in their answer but also filed
a cross-claim for damages against the other defendants for involving them in
the litigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 5, 1988, the other defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that it did not state a cause of action and
that only the S of G Foundation was a real party-in-interest.  A copy of the motion was furnished the
Orbeta spouses.  On January 2, 1989, the
trial court issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
dismissing the complaint for lack of a cause of action.  The cross-claim was also dismissed because it
"had no more leg to stand on."</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 12, 1989, the plaintiffs filed a motion for
reconsideration, <span style="">which </span>was
adopted by the Orbeta spouses in an urgent <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> manifestation
dated February 7, 1989.  <span style="">This </span>motion was denied on February 8,
1989.  The Crisologos then challenged
the order of dismissal before the Court of Appeals in a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.  Docketed as CA-GR No. 16837, it was dismissed on May 2, 1989, on the
ground that the proper remedy was an ordinary appeal.  The appellate court stressed that "since the petitioner did
not appeal from the questioned order of January 2, 1989, of respondent court
dismissing the complaint, said order had become final and executory."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This decision became final on May 25,
1989, and entry of judgment was made on July 11, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Orbeta spouses, who had not joined the Crisologos in CA-GR
No. 16837, filed their own petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, also with the
Court of Appeals.  Docketed as CA-GR No.
17013, this petition prospered.  On
September 28, 1990, the respondent court annulled the dismissal of the
complaint by the trial court and ordered its reinstatement.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Reconsideration of this decision was denied on August 27, 1991.  The petitioners then came to this Court,
raising several issues which, as will appear presently, are not decisive of
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial question before us is whether the Orbeta spouses, as
cross-claimants in the original complaint, <span style="">could </span>still appeal its dismissal in their own petition for
review.</p>

<p class="BODY">We think not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most important reason is that the order of dismissal issued
by the trial court had already become final and executory at the time it was
sought to be reversed.  The reglementary
period for appealing it had already lapsed when the Crisologos filed their
petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> under Rule 65.  This was correctly dismissed by the Court of Appeals on the
ground, as earlier stated, that the special civil action was not a substitute
for a lost appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the Orbetas filed their own petition on March 6, 1989, it
was also after the order they were questioning had already become
unappealable.  On this score alone, the
present petition must fail.  Even as the
petition of the plaintiffs themselves had been earlier dismissed, similar
treatment should have been given to the petition of the Orbetas, who were
appealing only as cross-claimants.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cross-claim is any claim by one party against a co-party
arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter either
of the original action or of a counter-claim therein.  Such cross-claim may include a claim that the party against whom
it is asserted is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a
claim asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The cross-claim in this case stemmed from the alleged unjust
refusal of the donees to return the donated properties, resulting in the
Crisologos filing their complaint for revocation of the donations.  In their cross-claim, the Orbetas alleged that
they were dragged into the controversy because of the conduct of the
petitioners.  Their contention was that
they would not have been sued at all were it not for the failure of the
petitioners to comply with the conditions of the donations.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the cross-claim arose from the complaint of the
Crisologos and was not separable from that main action.  It had no independent existence and was
based entirely on that complaint.  The
cross-claim was defensive in character because it could prosper only if the
plaintiffs succeeded.  As the plaintiffs
failed to establish that the petitioners' refusal was not justified, it
necessarily followed that the private respondents' own cross-claim, which was
based on the same allegation, also had to fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Torres v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>In any event, even viewing the situation in the light most
favorable to the Laicos, their cross-claim on Chivi's warranty to deliver title
to them was so inextricably linked with and so utterly dependent upon the
success of the complaint of the Sierras for the repurchase of the land that
when the complaint was dismissed, the cross-claim could not possibly
survive.  For as the cross-claimants
themselves alleged, the cross-defendants would be liable on the warranty
"should the plaintiffs finally obtain favorable judgment in their
favor" (sic).  The warranty became <u>functus</u>
<u>oficio</u> after the Sierras, who turned out after all to have a free patent
title to the land issued way back in 1932, agreed to transfer and did transfer
said title to the Laicos - first by the deed of sale executed directly in their
favor by the Sierras on January 17, 1960, and again in the amicable settlement
of the case between them.  The fact that
the Laicos paid P10,000.00 to the Sierras in that amicable settlement created
no liability on the part of the Chivis:  first, because the latter neither knew nor consented to such settlement;
second, because the Laicos had already acquired the land directly, from the
Sierras by virtue of the aforesaid sale of January 17, 1960; and third because
the said sum of P10,000.00 was not the subject of the cross-claim against them.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Apropos is the following statement of the legal principle:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A cross-bill strictly speaking is one brought by a defendant
in an equity suit against x x x other defendants in the same suit, touching the
matters in question in the original bill.  It is considered as an auxiliary suit dependent upon the original bill,
and can be sustained only on matters growing out of the original bill.  There is a well-defined distinction between
a cross-bill merely defensive in character, and one seeking affirmative
relief.  The dismissal of the original
bill carries with it a purely defensive cross-bill but not one seeking
affirmative relief." (Osius vs. Barton, 88 A.L.R. 394, 402)</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cross-claim in this case was purely defensive in nature.  It arose entirely out of the complaint and
could prosper only if the plaintiffs succeeded.  Hence, under the principle above enunciated, it could not be the
subject of independent adjudication once it lost the nexus upon which its life
depended.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The cross-claimants cannot claim more rights than the plaintiffs
themselves, on whose cause of action the cross-claim depended.  The dismissal of the complaint divested the
cross-claimants of whatever appealable interest they might have had before and
also made the cross-claim itself no longer viable.</p>

<p class="BODY">A party has an appealable interest only when his property may be
diminished, his burdens increased or his rights prejudiced by the order sought
to be reviewed.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the consequence of the dismissal of the complaint was the
cessation of the cross-claimants' exposure to injury, which risk would in fact
have continued if the Crisologos' appeal had succeeded.  It bears stressing that when the plaintiffs'
petition was dismissed by the Court of Appeals, the cross-claim lost its basis,
which was the dismissed complaint itself.  Earlier, in fact, the dismissal of the cross-claim had already become
unappealable when the order dismissing the complaint became final and
executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be highly irregular to allow the reinstatement of the
appeal lost by the plaintiffs through another appeal made by the
cross-claimants.  Not only was the
cross-claim defensive in character and therefore deemed dismissed with the
complaint but, as pointed out by the petitioners, the cross-claimants and the
plaintiffs were supposed to be opposing parties and not in collusion with each
other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our ruling is that the Orbetas, as cross-claimants, had no
personality to pursue a remedy which properly belonged to the Crisologos who,
through their fault or negligence, failed to employ it.  Accordingly, the petition filed by the
Orbetas should have been dismissed outright by the respondent court on the ground
that the cross-claimants were not proper parties to appeal the dismissal of the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing observations, the Court finds it
unnecessary to resolve the issues raised by the herein petitioners in their
assignment of errors.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision rendered by the respondent court
on September 28, 1990, and its resolution dated August 27, 1991, are SET ASIDE
and the dismissal of Civil Case No. 313-KC in the Regional Trial Court of
Ilocos Sur is AFFIRMED.  No costs.</p>
