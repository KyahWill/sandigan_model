				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Even before security <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>tenure
for the laborer was dignified into a constitutional right in 1973, it was
already recognized as one of the great guarantees of the worker against
arbitrary dismissal by his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant to the social justice policy, the government has consistently emphasized
and strengthened this right, which in a less enlightened age not far from ours
was scornfully dismissed as an unspeakable heresy.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say that once invoked, the right is automatically
granted because of our compassionate concern for the worker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not exactly correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While security of tenure stands faithful
vigil over his interests, it will be extended to him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">for his protection only when it is shown that he deserves it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is </span>also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">part of social justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the petitioner contends that its employee,
the private respondent, did not have that right or has lost or abandoned it by
his own omissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It therefore asks us
to reverse the decision of the then Minister of Labor ordering the
reinstatement of the employee and the payment to him of back wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner is a duly organized corporation with a valid
authorization from the Board of Transportation to operate a bus line.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent was hired by it in
1966 and continued serving therein as a bus driver until the incident in
question, when he was relieved of his duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He has not been reinstated to date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident occurred on August 10, 1974, at about 2:30 in the
afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Romeo Hughes was driving <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit Bus No. 1066 when it was stalled at the
railroad crossing in <span class="SpellE">Calumpit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
because the vehicle ahead of it had stopped owing to a jeep that was making its
way into a garage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As thus positioned,
the bus was hit at its rear end by an onrushing train of the Philippine
National Railways that dragged it several meters and flung it on its side at a
nearby ditch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eighteen passengers died
and fifty-six others suffered serious physical injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bus itself sustained extensive
damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the petitioner, it
spent P436,642.03 for the settlement of the claims of the deceased and injured
passengers and another P179,511.52 for the repair of the bus.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>complaint
damages against the Philippine National Railways, which was held liable for its
negligence in a decision rendered on April 6, 1977, by Judge <span class="SpellE">Benigno</span> <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The private respondent was absolved of any contributory negligence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision was elevated to the Court of Appeals, which had not yet resolved
the same at the time this petition was filed with this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>also prosecuted for multiple
homicide and multiple serious physical injuries, but the case was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">provisionally dismissed by the trial court </span>on
March 19, 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason was failure
of the prosecution witness to appear at the scheduled hearing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The private respondent claims that soon after the decision
against the PNR, he had his driver's license renewed and then sought
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was advised to wait until termination of
the criminal case against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
repeated his request several <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">times </span>thereafter
but with the same result, even after the dismissal of the criminal case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He then decided to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">seek </span>the assistance of Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>,
w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ho wr</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ote the petitioner on April 24, </span>1980, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">and </span>"implored" the private respondentâ€™s re-employment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
As this request <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>also <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ignored, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Hughes </span>finally demanded his reinstatement on May 2, 1980, in a
letter signed by his counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On May 10, 1980, the petitioner replied to say he could not be reinstated
because his driver's license had already been revoked and his driving was
"extremely dangerous to the riding Public."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's reaction to this rejection was to file
on July 29, 1980, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>formal
complaint with the Ministry of Labor and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Emplo</span>yment<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>for illegal dismissal against the
petitioner, with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>prayer for
his reinstatement with back wages from May 10, 1980, plus emergency cost of
living allowance.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 22, 1981, the complaint was dismissed by Director
Francisco L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, National Capital Region, on
the ground of prescription, "it appearing that although the private
respondent was separated from the service on 10 August 1974 (date <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the accident), or in 1975 when his
suspension had presumably metamorphosed into a dismissal, it was not until 29
July 1980, or a little less than 6 years thereafter, when he filed the
complaint." The decision also said, he was guilty of criminal negligence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The regional director was, however, reversed by Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> in his order dated May 21, 1981, calling for the
reinstatement of Hughes with full back wages and without loss of seniority
rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The finding of the public
respondent was that Hughes was not guilty of criminal or civil negligence nor
was it correct to say that his action had prescribed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In challenging this order, the petitioner contends that the
private respondent is not entitled to reinstatement because he had abandoned
his work; that he is guilty of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> in not
asserting his right sooner; and that in any case his cause of action had long
prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it had lost
confidence in the private respondent, a circumstance that by itself alone was
sufficient to justify <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">his </span>dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The charge of abandonment must fail for shallowness and proven
falsity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the
petitioner's allegation that it never heard from the private respondent again
for six years after the collision is obviously untrue for it is a matter of
record that he was in fact its principal witness in its civil complaint for
damages against the PNR.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In the second place, it is not disputed that after the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> absolving Hughes of contributory negligence, the
private respondent requested his reinstatement but the request was rejected as
many times as it was made, and even when it was reiterated by Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> himself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In the third place, it is plain that if the private respondent did not demand
his reinstatement earlier, it was because the petitioner deceived him into
believing he would be eventually reinstated, although he never was, even after
he had renewed his driver's license and, still later, after the criminal charge
against him had been dropped.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Never at any time did the private respondent manifest loss of interest in
recovering his work nor did he make any waiver, express or implied, of his
right to be reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when
his demand was finally rejected on May 10, 1980, he lost no time in asserting
his security of tenure and filed his complaint for reinstatement less than
three months later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the jurisprudence cited by the petitioner on this
point refers to public office, title to which is deemed abandoned if not
asserted within one year from divestment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Public interest requires that all conflicting claims are resolved as soon
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>possible, to stabilize the
title to such office.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
No similar urgency applies to private positions, which is the reason why a
longer period is allowed for the vindication of one's right to such employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of prescription deserves <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">a </span>more extended examination if only because this was the
principal basis of the decision rendered by the regional director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, the complaint should be
dismissed because it was filed late under Article 291<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">*</span></span></a> of the Labor Code providing that all claims
accruing before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Code on
November 1, 1974 should be filed within one year thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision continued to say that even
assuming that the indefinite suspension developed into a dismissal only in
1975, after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Code, the action
should still be deemed prescribed and also forever barred because it was not
filed within three years from such dismissal, conformably to the same article.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said article reads in material part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 291. Money claims. - All money claims arising from
employer-employee relations accruing during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be filed within three (3) years from the time the cause of
action accrued; otherwise they shall be forever barred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All money claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be filed with the appropriate entities established under
this Code within one (1) year from the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>,
and shall be processed or determined in accordance with implementing rules and
regulations of the Code; otherwise, they shall be forever barred.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Echoing the regional director, the petitioner contends that the
private respondent's complaint was filed tardily on July 29, 1980, as this was
way beyond the prescriptive periods prescribed in Article 291 as counted from
August 10, 1974, the date when the collision occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">im</span>portant to
observe that another prescriptive period must also be considered, to wit, that
established under Article 1146 of the Civil Code, providing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>ART. 1146. The following actions must be instituted within four years:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Upon an injury to the rights of
the plaintiff;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Upon a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court, in applying this period in <span class="SpellE">Callanta</span>
v. Carnation Philippines, Inc.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
gave the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>One's employment or profession is a 'property right' and the
wrongful interference therewith is an actionable wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right is considered to be property within
the protection of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, when one is arbitrarily and
unjustly deprived of his job or means of livelihood, the action instituted to
contest the legality of one's dismissal from employment constitutes, in
essence, an action predicated â€˜upon an injury to the rights of the plaintiff,â€™
as contemplated under Article 1146 of the New Civil Code, which must be brought
within 4 years.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine was recently affirmed in Pan-<span class="SpellE">Fil</span>
Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Agujar</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
albeit with several dissents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever prescriptive period is applicable, the antecedent
question that has to be settled is the date when the cause of action accrued
and from which the period shall commence to run.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties disagree on this date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the petitioner is that it
should be August 10, 1974, when the collision occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent insists it is May 10,
1980, when his demand for reinstatement was rejected by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled jurisprudence that a cause of action has three
elements, to wit, (1) a right in favor of the plaintiff by whatever means and
under whatever law it arises or is created; (2) an obligation on the part of the
named defendant to respect or not to violate such right; and (3) an act or
omission on the part of such defendant <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
the right of the plaintiff or constituting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>breach of the obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The problem in the case at bar is with the third element as the
first two are deemed established.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the private respondent's right of action could not
have accrued from the mere fact of the occurrence of the mishap on August 10,
1974 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>he was not considered automatically
dismissed on that date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At best, he was
deemed suspended from his work, and not even by positive act of the petitioner
but as a result of the suspension of his driver's license because of the
accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no apparent
disagreement then between Hughes and his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the private respondent was the
petitioner's principal witness in its complaint for damages against the
Philippine National Railways, we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">may </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assume </span>that <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span>
Transit and Hughes were on the best of terms when the case was being
tried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there existed no
justification at that time for the private respondent to demand reinstatement
and no opportunity warrant either for the petitioner to reject that demand.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the private respondent that May 10, 1980, is the
date when his cause of action accrued, for it was then that the petitioner
denied his demand for reinstatement and so committed the act or omission
"constituting a breach of the obligation of the defendant to the
plaintiff." The earlier requests made by him having <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">been warded off with indefinite promises, and
the private respondent not yet having decided to assert his right, his cause of
action could not be said to have then already accrued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issues had not yet been joined, so to
speak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This happened only when the
private respondent finally demanded his reinstatement on May 2, 1980, and his
demand was categorically rejected by the petitioner on May 10, 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We have held in earlier
cases that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Since a 'cause of action' requires, as essential elements, not only
a legal right of the plaintiff and a correlative obligation of the defendant
but also 'an act or omission of the defendant in violation of said legal
right,â€™ the cause of action does not accrue until the party obligated refuses,
expressly or impliedly, to comply with its duty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The one-year period should instead be counted from the date of
rejection by the insurer as this is the time when the cause of action
accrues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since in these cases there has
yet been no accrual of cause of action, We hold that prescription has not yet
set in.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>It follows that appellant's cause of action arose only when the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> made known their intention, by <u>overt</u> <u>acts</u>,
not to abide by the true agreement and the allegations of the complaint

<u>de</u> <u>retro</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was then, and only then, that the
appellant's cause of action arose to enforce the true contract and have the
apparent </span>one reformed or disregarded, and the period of extinctive
prescription began to run against her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the private
respondent's complaint was filed not later than three months only after such
rejection, there is no question that his action has not prescribed, whatever
prescriptive period is applied.</p>

<p class="BODY">This should also dispose of the claim of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>,
for equally obvious reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last contention of the petitioner is that it had lost
confidence in the private respondent and so was justified in dismissing
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this matter, the petitioner is
clearly hoist with its own petard.</p>

<p class="BODY">We assume that the loss of confidence invoked by the petitioner
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the private respondent's
driving skill, not in his character or other personal attributes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the claim must be dismissed
outright as the position of driver is not primarily confidential in nature like
that of a cashier or a private secretary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This alleged loss of confidence is based, as the petitioner said in its
letter of May 10, 1980, on the collision between the PNR train and the <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit bus the private respondent was driving at
the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The implication in that letter
is that the mishap was due to his negligence and that it was for this reason
that he had been dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a clear <span class="SpellE"><u>volte</u></span> <u>face</u>
if there ever was one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is
contending with itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier, in its
complaint for damages against the Philippine National Railways, <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit was singing an entirely different tune and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>loud in defending the private
respondent from the charge that he was responsible for the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in its answer to the counterclaim, the
petitioner declared in no uncertain terms:</p>

<blockquote>4. - That the <u>driver
of the passenger bus of the plaintiff exercised due care in approaching the
said railroad crossing at <span class="SpellE">Calumpit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and thereafter passed over the railroad track
because there was no train in sight, and said passenger bus stopped while its
rear portion was on the railroad track due to a stopped vehicle ahead of it, so
that said driver cannot remove the passenger bus before the approach of the
train of the defendants</u>, which was coming very fast, imprudently and
negligently, in wanton disregard of dang<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">er</span>
to human lives and properties considering that the stopped passenger bus of the
plaintiff at the railroad track was visible to locomotive engineer <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cirbado</span> at a great
distance sufficient for him to reduce his speed and finally stop to avoid the
collision, but that notwithstanding he failed to exercise due care in reducing
his speed and stopping the train to avoid hitting and bumping the rear portion
of plaintiff's passenger bus, thereby resulting in the fatal collision, <u>all
of which was due to the fault and wanton negligence of defendant</u>. (Emphasis
supplied).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court accepted this assertion and rendered judgment
against the PNR, at the same time also absolving the private respondent from
even contributory negligence, thus:</p>

<blockquote><u>Contributory negligence may not be ascribed to the driver, it
was evident that he had taken the necessary, precautions before passing over
the railway track</u>; if the bus was hit, <u>it was for reasons beyond the
control of the driver because he had no place to g</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">o</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">; </span>there were vehicles to his left which prevented him in swerving
towards that direction; his bus stalled in view of the obstructions in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">his </span>front - where a sand and gravel
truck stopped because of a jeep maneuvering into a garage up front. (Emphasis
supplied).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If it is also remembered that Hughes had never been involved in
any traffic accident during his entire period of employment with <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span> Transit, from 1966 until 1974 - and indeed even
before that - the conclusion must follow that the petitioner had no basis for
its alleged loss of confidence in the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Court sees it, the private respondent simply had the
misfortune of being at the wheel of the <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span>
Transit bus when, through no fault of his, it was hit and wrecked by the PNR
train due to the negligence of its driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The happenstance that Hughes was then driving the bus is certainly no
justification for his dismissal on the specious ground that the petitioner had
lost confidence in him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The collision of August 10, 1974, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">victimized </span>not only the dead and injured passengers but the private
respondent as well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For reasons not
imputable to him, he has been unable to resume his work as a bus driver with
the petitioner since that tragic day almost fifteen years ago when the speeding
train crashed into his life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">we made things right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, </span>we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sustain the order </span>requiring <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">his </span>reinstatement by the petitioner and
approve the award of civil damages to him except as to the back wages, which
are hereby limited to three years only in accordance with existing policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By this decision, we affirm anew, the
worker's right to security of tenure, recognizing it once again <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a </span>vigilant sentinel of labor in the
protection <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of its interests.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>subject to the modification of the
challenged order of May 21, 1981 as to the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
