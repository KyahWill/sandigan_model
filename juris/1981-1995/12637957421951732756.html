</span>Petitioners were charged and convicted in 33 cases for estafa through
falsification of public and commercial documents (Article 315, in relation to
Article 171, Revised Penal Code) in a decision of the Sandiganbayan promulgated
on 15 July 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The total amount of
Government funds (treasury warrants) involved was somewhat over P2.7 million.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 March 1986, petitioners moved "to close their cases
and release [their] bond[s]" on the ground that they had been given
amnesty by former President F. E. Marcos on 28 January 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Sandiganbayan required them to submit
originals or authenticated copies of their amnesty papers, which petitioners
were unable to produce.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, the
Sandiganbayan denied petitioners' motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion
for reconsideration, the accused sought to prove by secondary evidence their
claim that they had been granted amnesty by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>The Tanodbayan objected to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allowing
</span>the accused to adduce secondary evidence of g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">rant(s) </span>of amnesty to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an extended resolution dated 27 January
1987, the respondent Sandiganbayan denied the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners now <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">seek </span><i>certiorari</i>
to review and set <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">aside </span>the
extended resolution of the Sandiganbayan, claiming <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Decree No. 1082, the applicable amnesty statue according to petitioners, did
not apply to them; and secondly, in not allowing them to present secondary
evidence of the amnesty allegedly granted by the former President to the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners state that they applied for amnesty through the
3rd and 11th Amnesty Commission (sic) of Lanao del Sur and Marawi City and that
on 2 February 1985, they were granted conditional amnesty by the said
Commission, subject to the approval or final action of the President of the
Philippines pursuant to P.D. No. 1082, dated 2 February 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Amnesty Commission, the petitioners
continue, endorsed the amnesty applications of the petitioners to the
President, recommending approval thereof or grant of executive clemency to the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners' amnesty
applications are said to have been submitted to the Office of the President by
the then Presidential Assistant Victor Nituda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Former Governor Mohammed Ali Dimaporo, the petitioners further state,
made written representations dated 27 January 1986 with former President Marcos
concerning the petitioners' applications during <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>political rally of the Kilusang
Bagong Lipunan on 22 January 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Marcos apparently wrote on the upper righthand corner of former Governor Dimaporo's
letter the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Approved" and signed the same with a partly illegible
date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners state, finally,
that the original copies of the amnesty papers were in the possession of then
Presidential Adviser Joaquin Venus and were lost or destroyed at Malaca√±ang
"during the February 1986 bloodless military revolution" and could
not now be located.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The respondent
Sandiganbayan declined to allow the petitioners to submit secondary evidence of
the claimed applications for and grant of amnesty, upon the ground that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">even if the petitioners were </span>to
succeed in proving or authenticating the alleged amnesty <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">papers </span>through secondary evidence,
petitioners would nonetheless not be entitled to discharge from the convictions
rendered by that court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
court held that the benefits of amnesty were never available to the petitioners
under P.D. No. 1182.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
