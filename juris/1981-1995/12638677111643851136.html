in Criminal Case No. T-1141 of the Regional Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>,

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts of the case is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At or about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of September 17,
1981, complainant <span class="SpellE">Mercia</span> <span class="SpellE">Icaonapo</span>,
<span style="">a </span>twenty one-year old,
unmarried girl then residing at <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, rode <span style="">in </span>the tricycle of appellant Romeo <span class="SpellE">Camasis</span> on her way home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She had just bought some household items from the <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>
market upon request of her brother, <span class="SpellE">Joventino</span> <span class="SpellE">Icaonapo</span> (TSN, p. 6-7, October 5, 1983).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The tricycle’ (sic) first stop was <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>,
where a passenger alighted, and then it continued its trip in the direction of
the <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span> Agro-Indus­trial School.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the tricycle was about to pass the
complainant's house, she tapped appellant and said ‘<span class="SpellE">digdi</span>
<span class="SpellE">na</span>, <span class="SpellE">digdi</span> <span class="SpellE">na</span>’ (here already, here already). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>However, he intentionally ignored her and
continued driving until reaching the school, about one-half (1/2) kilometer
away from <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mercia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="SpellE">'s</span> house, where the rest of the passengers dis­embarked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant promised to drive complainant back
to <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, he instead proceeded to a place called <span class="SpellE">Bagumbayan</span>,
about one kilometer away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
got scared because the place was so dark and deserted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She immediately went out of the tricycle to
seek help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant followed and
suddenly embraced her from behind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he dragged her to a nearby coconut plantation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She shouted for help and resisted him by
pulling his hair, slapping his face and biting his left forearm, but to no
avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant prevailed upon her when
she was dropped and forcibly pushed to the ground where she lost
consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, p. <span style="">9-21, </span>October 5, 1983).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“When complainant regained her consciousness, she felt pain in her
private part and noticed her pants and panty rolled down to her knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was beside her trying to roll up
her pants and panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant,
obviously shocked by appellant's sexual abuse on her, ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He followed and cajoled her with a promise of
marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, she had no choice but
to board the <span style="">tricycle, </span>and
appellant drove her to her house (TSN, p. <span style="">23-24,
</span>October 5, 1983).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of the same day, complainant arrived home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was met by her sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Diosdada</span> <span class="SpellE">Icaonapo</span>, who observed
her sobbing and appearing nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
persuaded complainant to tell what happened and, after some hesitation, the
latter confided that she was abused by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, complainant accompanied by
her sister-in-law went to the police of <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span> and
reported the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police
conducted investigation and later summoned appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police noticed that appellant had an
injury on his left forearm (TSN, p. 7-20, March 7, 1984).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span> Public Health
Officer, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Leonides</span> Cruel, later confirmed the
injury of appellant and issued a medical certificate (Exhibit ‘C’).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police required complainant to submit
herself for medical examination and was then examined by Dr. Dante <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ziga</span></st1:placename>

admitted that the complainant <span class="SpellE">Mercia</span> <span class="SpellE">Icaonapo</span> was one of the passengers on board the motorized

Agro-Industrial School at <span class="SpellE">Libtong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, in the late
afternoon of 17 <span style="">September 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he denied having brought the said
complainant to <span class="SpellE">Bagumbayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span> on the same day, as claimed by the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also denied having raped

the sexual act," and that the dastardly act could have been <span style="">committed only by a sex maniac or one who has
not expe­rienced the sexual act but not by the appellant who is a father of
seven (7) children, married to a beautiful wife and who has had enough sex with
her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is also without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show that the complainant
was raped while her pants and panty were rolled down to her knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that, <u>when</u> <u>she</u>
<u>regained</u> <u>consciousness</u>, she felt pain in her vagina and saw the
appellant trying to roll up her pants which had rolled down to her knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rape must <span style="">have been committed previous to that moment and under circumstances
favorable to the appellant, as the complainant was then unconscious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claim that the appellant could not have raped the complainant
because he is married to a beautiful wife and has enough <span style="">sex </span>with her
cannot, by itself alone, negate the circumstances which point to him as the
rapist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the appellant <span style="">has </span>not
shown any ill-motive why the complainant filed this case against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court said, "it is hard to
believe that a young unmarried woman would reveal <span style="">that she was deflowered and allow an examination of her private parts
and thereafter permit herself to be the </span>subject <span style="">of public trial if her motive was not to bring to justice the person
who wronged her." As </span><span style="">a matter </span><span style="">of fact, the complainant was hesitant to be examined by a male
physician.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wanted a lady physician
to </span><span style="">see </span><span style="">her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But since there was no lady physician available and the only doctor
round was Dr. <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span>, a male, she had to submit to
Dr. <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> for medical examination because the
medical certificate was urgently needed by the police.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant contends that the commission of rape is
belied by the entry in the polite blotter of the <span class="SpellE">Tiwi</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, police station,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
which states that the crime <span style="">reported
was only acts of lasciviousness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The veracity and reliability of this entry in the police blotter,
however, is contested by the appellant <span style="">himself
when he said:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the police blotter entry, the previous report was acts of
lasciviousness and later on Rape was intercalated therein, this could be seen
because their (sic) were different ball pens used.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here we also see the variance of the test<span style="">i</span>mony as well as the report of the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, did not commit any error in finding
the appellant guilty of the crime for which he was charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The indemnity to be paid to the victim,
however, should be increased to P30,000.00 in line with the new policy of the
Court on the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED
with the sole modification above–indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With costs against the appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
