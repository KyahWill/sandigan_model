				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> of the </span><st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="8"><span style="">August </span><span style="">27, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">decision
of the Government Auditing Office affirming the </span><st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="1"><span style="">January </span><span style="">23, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">decision
of the Postmaster?</span>General.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner Chartered
Bank, through its Iloilo City Branch, was accepting postal money orders from
the general public since </span><span style="">1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">The
accepted postal money orders were then presented to the Iloilo City Post Office
for payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the occasions when
the available cash in the Post Office was less than the value of the postal
money orders, the Iloilo Post Office issued receipts acknowledging the
remaining balance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, on May 8, 1968,
the Bureau of Posts issued </span>an unnumbered <span style="">c</span><span style="">ircular principally </span>addressed to its officers
<span style="">and employees and a "Memorandum of
Understanding Covering Cashing and Clearing of Money Orders", effective
October 1, 1968, addressed to several entities including members of the Bankers
Association of the Philippines, both involving the installation of a new postal
money order system which requires that all commercial banks, regardless of
location, must clear all postal money orders they have received and paid with
the Central Bank at Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Comment, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 39-42).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">All these
notwithstanding, petitioner continued its transactions with the Post Office
under the old practice through the latter's Acting Cashier <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Primalion</span> be­yond October 1, 1968 when the new postal
money order system came into effect, until July </span><span style="">6, </span><span style="">1970 when petitioner
bank noticed that "payment for money orders <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P161,221.47 as of </span><span style="">3 </span><span style="">July, 1970 had not yet been received by
us", as stated in its letter of the same date (Annex “D", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17-A).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
having received any payment or reply, petitioner wrote another letter dated
July 14, 1970 (<u>Ibid</u>, p. 18), to which Acting Postmaster Ernesto Cabanas
finally replied in a letter dated July 28, 1970 </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span><span style="">p. </span><span style="">19) </span><span style="">informing petitioner that he "is not aware that said amount is
still carried as an obligation of the Iloilo Post Office"; citing Bureau
of Posts Circular (Unnumbered) dated May 8, 1968 paragraph "C" to
support his stand that officially, no com­mercial bank could present postal
money orders to post offices for payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, Postmaster Cabanas de­clared "that your bank has been
dealing direct with our cashier without the knowledge nor consent of the
undersigned".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 42).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He assured petitioner however,
that he would take up the matter with the higher postal authorities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After two follow-up
letters by the petitioner (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 20 and 21), Postal Superintendent
Julian D. <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, in a letter dated </span><st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="11"><span style="">November
 </span><span style="">4, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 22), informed the petitioner that he had referred the matter to the Post­master
General and that follow-ups should be made in the Bureau of Posts, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pedro P. <span class="SpellE">Gambalan</span>, Officer-in-Charge of the Post Office in his
letter dated March 11, 1972 (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. </span><span style="">23-24) </span><span style="">stated in brief
that the arrangements made by the Branch Manager of petitioner at Iloilo City
with the cashier at the Iloilo City Post Office partake of the nature of a
private arrange­ment not </span><span style="">sanctioned
</span><span style="">by the Post Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, any claim for settlement
of any unpaid money orders should be directed against the </span><span style="">said </span><span style="">Cashier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an unauthorized
transaction, it would necessitate the approval of the Auditor General.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Accordingly, petitioner
filed a letter petition with the Auditor General relative thereto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Acting Postmaster
General's view which was the same as above-cited was expressed in his 7th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span> dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="1"><span style="">January 23, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> which was reiterated by the Acting Chairman
of the Commission on Audit in a letter dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="2"><span style="">Feb­ruary 27, </span><span style="">1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 14) which letter reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"In reply to your
letter dated </span>May 8, 1972, claiming in effect the sum of P81,200.00 <span style="">plus </span>legal interest <span style="">of 6% per annum effective July </span><span style="">6, 1970 </span>which represents unpaid postal
money orders issued by the Iloilo City Post Office, please find enclosed a copy
of <span style="">the 7th <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>
dated January </span><span style="">23, 1974 </span>of
the Acting Postmaster General, which is self-explanatory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view hereof, this Commission finds no legal basis for
allowing pay­ment of your aforementioned claim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In compliance with the
resolution of the Second Division of this Court dated </span><st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="4"><span style="">April </span><span style="">19, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,

 20, <span style="">1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>(<u>Ibid</u>., p. <span style="">76) </span>the case was set for hearing on <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="9">September <span style="">5, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>at which date the parties appeared

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In compliance therewith,
petitioner filed its Memo­randum </span>on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="10">October <span style="">4, </span><span style="">1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>(<u>Ibid</u>.,

<p class="BODY">On November <span style="">19, 1974, </span>petitioner
filed a Reply Memo­randum (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 119-122) and on November 27, 1974,
the <span style="">Solicitor-General filed a
Manifestation, alleging, among others that respondents have not paid </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">single centavo to the petitioner so that
whatever payments may have taken place were clearly made by <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Primalion</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. </span><span style="">142-143).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">Thereafter
the case was submitted for decision (<u>Ibid</u>.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no dispute that
petitioner was aware of the installation of the new system of cashing and
clearing of money orders and that the transactions in question took </span>place
during a period when said new system had already been officially installed.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioner and respondents differ <span style="">as </span>to the
interpretation of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Unnumbered Circular
of the Bureau of Posts, subject of this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that they are directory and permis­sive in
nature, intended primarily for the convenience of commercial banks within the
Greater Manila area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner
specifically pointed out the provision of paragraph "C" of the said
unnumbered circular which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"c.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new money
orders may be cashed at any money order office or commercial bank within one
year from the date of issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
cashed at commercial bank, or handled by the bank for its customers, will be
cleared through the Central Bank essentially like Treasury Warrants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will no longer be necessary for commercial
banks to bring such money orders to a post office for redemptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will save much time for banks and post
offices."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and laid stress on the phrase "It
will no longer be neces­sary" which allegedly merely provides a new
procedure in the encashment of money orders (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 84-85).</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly in the Memorandum of Understanding, petitioner insists,
that the intention was to grant a new right to commercial banks which could not
be availed of before the issuance of aforesaid memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, with the option allegedly given to
commercial banks, petitioner believes that there is no mistake or error on the
part of the cashier to have acted for and in behalf of the Iloilo City Post
Office in dealing with the petitioner bank under the old arrangement and
consequently has acted within the limits <span style="">of
the law and the unnumbered circular, for and in behalf </span>of the Iloilo
Post Office (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 88-89).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the other hand,
respondents m<span style="">aintain </span>that the
pur­poses of the new postal money order system negate the con­tention that said
circular and memorandum are not mandatory in nature and that they are for the
convenience of commercial banks operating in the Manila area only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents argue that viewed in its total
context, there can be no doubt that the Memorandum of Understanding was
intended to install a new system of clearing postal money orders to completely
supplant the old one that had spawned unmitigated corruption resulting in great
financial loss to the country (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
105-106).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact the language of both
circular and memorandum provides for no exception to the rule that all
commercial banks, regardless of where located, must clear all postal money
orders they have received and paid, with the Central Bank at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 41).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contention of the
respondents is meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The new centralized
system for clearing postal money </span>orders took effect by way of the
Unnumbered Circular of <span style="">May 8, 1968 of
the Bureau of Posts in implementation of the "Memorandum of Understanding
Covering Cashing and Clearing of Money Orders" previously issued by the
Office of the Joint Committee on Financial Management Improvement Program
(Annexes "A" and "B" of respondent's comment).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said office was created pursuant to Executive
Order No. </span>54 <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1966" day="8" month="12"><span style="">Decem­ber
 8, <span style="">1966</span></span></st1:date><span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 104).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no absolute
formal test for determining whe­ther a statutory direction is to be considered
mandatory </span>or directory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As with
any question of statutory construction the decisive factor is the meaning and
intention of the legislature, to be ascertained from a consideration of the <span style="">entire act, its nature, its object and the
consequences that would follow from construing it <span style="">one way or the other (<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> </span>"Statutes
and Their Construction", p. 99).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A careful study of the
Memorandum of Understanding shows that the installation of a Postal Money Order
System to take the place of the old one <span style="">was
provided </span>for in no uncertain terms.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The memorandum provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10">October 1,
 <span style="">1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>a new Postal
Money Order System will be ins­talled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several changes are proposed in the cashing and clearing process of the
new money orders to make them more usable in the channels of trade and
commerce.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the purpose of this
memorandum of understanding to set forth certain responsibilities and
agreements among the parties concerned in order that these important changes
can be accomplished.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new Money Order
Clearing Account will be established by the Central Bank <span style="">and </span>Bureau of Treasury effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10">October 1, <span style="">1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>to which such money order submitted
by commercial banks will be charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No old style money orders will be issued
after <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September <span style="">30, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Effective <st1:date year="1968" day="1" month="10">October 1, <span style="">1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>all <span class="SpellE">uncashed</span> old style money orders
will be referred to the Money Order Division for validation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those determined to be valid will be
cancelled and a Treasury Warrant issued, in the same amount, which can be
cashed under the same rules as any Treasury Warrant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, the avowed
purpose of the new system is more succinctly expressed in the unnumbered
circular of the Bureau of Posts which provides </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"d.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new system will
make it more difficult to forge, counterfeit or alter the new money order
forms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will enable the Money Order
Division and the General Auditing Office to match promptly by machine the money
Orders issued and paid, thus causing early detection of all irregularities for
appropriate action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All matching or
cross-checking of money orders <span style="">is­</span>sued
and paid will be centralized in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
instead of the City and Provin­cial Auditors doing it <span style="">as at </span>present."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nowhere in the provisions of said circular and memo­randum can it
be gleaned that exceptions to the general rule have been given, much less has
it been shown that options may be exercised by the commercial banks, as claimed
by the petitioner, to follow or not to follow the new system and revert to the
old one depending on their convenience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the memorandum itself is emphatic that no old style
money orders will be issued after <st1:date year="1968" day="30" month="9">September
 30, 1968</st1:date> and that all <span class="SpellE">uncashed</span> old style
money orders will be re­ferred to the Money Order Division for validation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither is there any provision granting authority to any official
or employee of the Bureau of Posts to maintain the old procedure at his
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the cir­cular
is emphatic in requiring that postmasters and ins­pectors shall attend training
sessions to insure a thorough knowledge and understanding of the new procedures
for ef­fective implementation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it <span style="">may, </span>the
important issue in this case, regardless of the mandatory or permissive
character of the memorandum and circular in question, is whether or not the
state can be bound or <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by the mistake, error
or unlawful act of its agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that both petitioner bank and Cashier <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Primalion</span> violated the
provisions of the unnumbered circular and Memorandum of Understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be­cause of such violations petitioner
suffered damage through no fault or negligence of the Bureau of Posts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, <span style="">petitioner in insisting on the old and clearly outlawed procedure
became the victim of the evils the new system seeks to avoid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioner cannot now be
allowed to shift the burden of loss on the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But just as important is
the generally accepted principle of law that the State cannot be bound nor <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> by the mistake, error or unlawful act of its
agents (Pineda et al. v. CFI et al., 52 Phil. 803-807; Koppel (Phil.) Inc. v.
Collector, </span>3 <span style="">SCRA 17, 23).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Equally well-settled is the principle that a
public official may be liable in his personal capacity for whatever damage he
may have caused by his act done with malice and in bad faith, or beyond the
scope of his authority or jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> v.
Court of Appeals, 114 SCRA 251; Mindanao Realty Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>,
</span>6 <span style="">SCRA 814 [1968]; the
Philippine Racing Club v. <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>, G.R. No. 11844,
August 31, 1960).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Cashier <span class="SpellE">Primalion</span> as a mere employee of
the respondent Bureau was bound to comply with the provisions of subject memorandum
and circular, otherwise, he would be open to administrative charges and
possible criminal prosecution for their violation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is therefore no denying that he acted
beyond the scope of his authority and in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is amply shown by his failure to pay
petitioner bank the balance of the money orders partially <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner bank has no other recourse but to go after said
cashier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact as the Solicitor
General has pointed out, said cashier may have already started paying the
amount demanded, since the amount has been reduced from P161,221.47 to P81,200.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such acceptance of payment from <span class="SpellE">Primalion</span> is an admission by petitioner that the latter's
liability is personal, not official, and by that act the petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from proceeding against the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <b>CONSIDERED</b>, the Court RESOLVED to <span style="">AFFIRM </span>the <st1:date year="1974" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1974</st1:date> decision of the Government
