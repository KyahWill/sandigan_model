<p class="BODY">The issue must be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Articles 1602 and 1604 of the Civil Code state:</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúART. 1602.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract

<blockquote>In any of the foregoing case, any money, fruits, or other benefit
to be received by the vendees as rent or otherwise shall be considered as

<blockquote>"ART. 1604<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The</span> provisions of Article 1602 shall also apply to a contract
purporting to be an absolute sale."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 1604 a contract purporting to be an absolute sale <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">shall </span>be presumed to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">an </span>equitable mortgage, should any of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the conditions in Article 1602 be
present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the presence
of only one circumstance defined in Article 1602 is sufficient </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">contract of sale with right to repurchase to be presumed an equitable
mortgage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that this case involves a series <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">transactions patterned after the earlier contract with Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span> which was indisputably a loan, although the
contract executed to secure the loan was an absolute deed of sale instead of a
mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it will be recalled,
that petitioner first mortgaged subject property </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the Development Bank
of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  11.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> as security for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">loan
of P52<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
avert foreclosure of the mortgage, petitioners borrowed P52<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
from Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span> with 1</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">2% </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">interest, executing a deed of absolute in
favor of Juan <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span> with right to collect the
rentals from the lessees thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later,
the loan from <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span> was again liquidated and the
property repurchased by borrowing the amount of P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
from private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As in their
transaction with <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span>, they executed a Deed of
Absolute Sale </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">favor of private respondents to secure the
loan with rights to collect rentals of the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, </span><st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">December 29, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, three documents were executed, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) a Deed of Absolute Sale from <span class="SpellE">Ang-angan</span> in favor of petitioners, (2) a Deed of Absolute
Sale </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">from </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioners in favor of private respondents
and (3) an Option to <span class="GramE">Repurchase</span> within a period of two
(2) years in favor of petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The consideration of the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by
petitioners in favor of private respondent was the P75,000.00 borrowed by the
former from the latter while the Option to Repurchase had a stated
consideration of P10,000.00 "payable at the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>repurchase" or two (2) years after execution of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the expiration of the two-year period, that is <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1967</st1:date>, it appears that
petitioners were again negotiating for a loan of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
from Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Maximino</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Amurao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> in order to pay private respondents the amount of P85,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time, petitioners failed to redeem their
property, thereby necessitating the filing of an action in Court to compel
private respondents to sell </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">property
in question back to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears obvious that petitioners were holding on to their
property despite financial difficulties to the extent that they had to incur
bigger and bigger loans in order to be able to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">pay the usurious interest involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this regard, this Court has already laid down the rule that a <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">retro</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">sale</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> m</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">y be deemed an equitable mortgage when
executed due to urgent necessity for money of the apparent vendor (<span class="SpellE">Labasan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lacuesta</span>, 86 SCRA 16
[1978]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another circumstance that supports the presumption that the
transaction between the parties was one of equitable mortgage is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the inadequacy of the consideration for the
supposed sale </span>considering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that
the property involved is a parcel of land containing an area <span class="GramE">of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">2,3</span>44<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">sq.m</span></span>. <span class="GramE">with</span>
a three-storey commercial building made of concrete walling </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">G.I. roofing constructed thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the construction of the said commercial
building, petitioners were able to obtain a loan in 1952 from the Development
Bank of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  11.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> in the amount of P52<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
with the above-described commercial property as collateral (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property is located in the
heart of <span class="SpellE">Ilagan's</span> commercial district.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is merit in petitioners' submission
that if they were able to borrow with it as collateral, P52<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
from the DBP in 1952, the fair market value of the 2,344 sq. m. commercial lot
and building at the time of the purported sale to private respondents on
December 29, 1965 or thirteen (13)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>years
later could have easily be within the range </span>of P300,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the alleged purchase price of P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> is, indeed, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">not
</span>only unusually inadequate but shocking to the conscience (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 141).</p>

<p class="BODY">A third circumstance is the fact that on the date of expiration
of the period to repurchase the property, private respondents, specifically
Carolina Ramirez instead of accepting the repurchase price of the property on
the pretext that she would not want to transact business with petitioners in
the absence of her husband, executed a note extending the period of redemption
to January 2, 1968 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 333).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">that </span>extension of the period of redemption is indicative of
equitable mortgage (Reyes v. de Leon, 20 SCRA 369 [1967]; <span class="SpellE">Bundalian</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 129 SCRA 645 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing transactions, it is evident that petitioners
and private respondents entered into a contract of equitable mortgage and not a
deed of <span class="SpellE">absoIute</span> sale as the latter insisted.</p>

<p class="BODY">But respondent Court of Appeals held the view that the two (2)
contracts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">entered </span>into by the
petitioners and private respondents herein were separate and distinct and
cannot be construed as an equitable mortgage and/or a sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">retro</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Among
</span>others, respondent Court based its ruling on the doctrine laid down in
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">case of <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span></span>
v. Court of Appeals (26 SCRA 189 [1968]), to the effect that the right of
repurchase is not a right granted the vendor by the vendee in a subsequent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">i</span>nstrument, but is a right reserved by
the vendor in the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">instrument of
sale as one of the stipulations of the contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, under similar circumstances, as in the case at bar, this
Court in a much later case (<span class="SpellE">Capulong</span> vs. Court of
Appeals, 130 SCRA 248 [1984]), ruled otherwise, holding that respondent Court
of Appeals was misled by the ruling in <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v. Court of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">Appeals </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">where the
situation was different.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>‚ÄúThere is one important factor that differentiates the <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span> case from the instant petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The document granting the vendors therein an
option to buy back the property was executed six (6) days after the execution
of the deed of sale whereas in the instant case the option to buy was embodied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a </span>document executed at the same time
that the questioned deed of sale was executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The option to buy in the <span class="SpellE">ViIlarica</span> case was
interpreted to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>only an
afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the
intent of the parties to circumvent the provision discouraging <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro sales is very apparent in the instant
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two contracts, the deed of
sale and the documents embodying the option to repurchase were prepared, signed
and notarized on the same day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">court </span>should have seen
through a transparent effort to make it appear that the two transactions were
not intimately related but distinct and separate as in the <span class="SpellE">Villarica</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>This should have put the Court on guard considering the other
circumstances of the case from which no other conclusion could be derived
except that the deed of absolute sale and the document giving the right to
repurchase were, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">fact, only </span>one
transaction of sale <span class="SpellE">pacto</span> de retro which must be
construed as an equitable mortgage.‚Äù <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Capulong</span>
v. Court of Appeals, <b>supra</b>).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As previously stated, the Deed of Absolute Sale and the Option to
<span class="GramE">Repurchase</span> in the instant case were executed by the
parties and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">notarized on the same date,
that is </span><st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">December 29, 1965</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>by the same notary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">public, </span>Julian <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">dela</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

172, respectively (Brief for the Petitioners-Appellants, p. 157).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the two documents are intimately related
is also shown by the fact that in the Option to Repurchase, the consideration
agreed upon for the repurchase of the properties is stated as P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which is the same amount<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt"> </span>stated as consideration in the Deed of Absolute Sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also expressly stated in the Option to
Repurchase that as consideration <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span>the
execution thereof, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">sum </span>of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> payable at the time of repurchase was agreed upon
and all expenses incidental to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>sale
and repurchase shall be chargeable to the account of petitioners, same to be
added to the consideration therein covenanted (Record on Appeal, p. 33).</p>

<p class="BODY">Still further, this Court ruled that even if no usury was
involved, a contract of loan with mortgage made to appear in paper as an
absolute sale with a companion option to buy, is null and void (<span class="SpellE">Capulong</span> v<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">. C.A., <u>supra</u>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court promulgated on
