				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In this petition for review on certiorari, petitioner assails the decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> of respondent Court of Appeals, dated 25 July 1988, rendered in CA-G.R. SP No. 12765, which affirmed the judgment of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 52, dismissing the appeal filed with the latter court for being premature and holding, in any event, that the proper remedy was a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br>The present case is related to G.R. No. 78438,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> as the two (2) cases arise from the same complaint filed by private respondents against the petitioner with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 29.<br><br>The antecedent facts of this case as revealed by the records of the present petition and those of G.R. No. 78438, are as follows:<br><blockquote>1.&nbsp; On 25 July 1986, private respondents (as plaintiffs) filed a complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> with the Metropo­litan Trial Court of Manila, Branch 29, alleging therein the following:&nbsp; that private respondents Salvador Salenga, Ramon Antonio, and Ulipia Fernandez are the lessees of petitioner, occupying nos. 948, 950 and 952 of the leased premises located in Pepin St., Sampaloc, Manila, respectively; that their respective monthly rentals thereon are P635.00, P950.00 and P950.00;&nbsp; that petitioner-defendant refused to collect the rentals for the months of May, June and July, 1986 except the P1500.00 which petitioner-defendant collected from respondent Antonio which represented rentals for the month of May, and one-half rental for June, 1986; that the aggregate amount (of) rentals that became due is P5,625.00 which petitioner refused to receive; that hence, private respondents sought the consignation of the said amount with the metropolitan (trial) court;<br><br>2. The petitioner-defendant filed a motion to dismiss complaint<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> on the ground that it is the regional trial courts, not metropolitan trial courts, which have jurisdiction over consignation cases, the subject matter of litigation being incapable of pecuniary estimation;<br><br>3. In the Order of the metropolitan (trial) court, dated 17 October 1986, the motion was dismissed (denied), ruling that the amount consigned (i.e. P5,625.00) being well below P20,000.00, the inferior court had jurisdiction, besides which a motion to dismiss is a prohibited pleading.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>4.&nbsp; Petitioner-defendant appealed the order to the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 52, which, in its decision dated 20 March 1987 dismissed the appeal on the ground that it was premature and in any event, the remedy was a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>5.&nbsp; On 23 June 1987, petitioner-defendant filed with this Court, a direct appeal docketed (as) G.R. No. 78438, from the judgment of the RTC, Manila, Branch 52, dated 20 March 1987.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>&nbsp; In the resolution dated 19 August 1987, this Court resolved “to REFER the case (G.R. No. 78438) to the Court of Appeals which has concurrent jurisdiction over the subject matter of the said petition, it appearing that no special and important reason had been cited to justify the Court's taking cognizance of the petition at the first instance."<br><br>6.&nbsp; Petitioner filed his motion for reconsideration of the resolution dated 19 August 1987, but which motion was denied by this Court in reso­lution dated 31 August 1988.&nbsp; Meantime, even before the Court resolved to deny the said motion,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> the respondent Court of Appeals, in its decision dated 25 July 1988, dismissed the petition (G.R. No. 78438, which was docketed CA-G.R. SP. No. 12765).<br><br>7.&nbsp; On 9 September 1988, petitioner filed with this Court a petition for review on certiorari docketed G.R. No. 84330, questioning the aforesaid decision of the respondent Court of Appeals.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote>The appellate court in its now assailed decision ruled as follows:&nbsp; <i>first</i>, that the jurisdiction of a court in consignation cases depends on the amount consigned, consignation being merely a form of payment and the opposite of a demand by a creditor for payment;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> <i>second</i>, that the RTC dismissed petitioner's appeal based on procedural rather than on substantive grounds, is of no moment, as what is decisive is that the complaint for consignation was filed in the proper court (Metropolitan Trial Court).<br><br>In the present petition (G.R. No. 84330), petitioner raises the following arguments, to wit:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">"A. </td> <td width="95%"><div align="justify">The respondent Court of Appeals erred in holding that consignation cases fall within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial Courts and that the amount consigned deter­mines said jurisdiction;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"B. </td> <td><div align="justify">The respondent Court of Appeals erred in refusing to resolve the issue of whether or not appeal and not a special civil action is the proper recourse when a motion to dismiss grounded on lack of jurisdiction, is denied;</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td>"C. </td> <td><div align="justify">The respondent Court of Appeals erred in issuing its decision of July 25, 1988, in spite of its awareness of incidents still pending before this Honorable Supreme Court, thus inflicting upon the litigants the not inconsiderable burden of more expenses, duplication of pleadings and additional work-load on both court and parties."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>The petition is not impressed with merit.<br><br>As to the first contention, petitioner submits that the action at bar is one for consignation, and it is the Regional Trial Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> not the Metropolitan Trial Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> which has jurisdiction over the same, inasmuch as the subject matter of litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation; and that the amount actually consigned (P5,625.00 in this case) is of no moment.<br><br>We do not agree.<br><br>Consignation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> is the act of depositing the thing due with the court or judicial authorities whenever the creditor cannot accept or refuses to accept payment and it generally requires a prior tender of payment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Two (2) of the requisites of a valid consignation are (1) that there is a debt due, and (2) the amount due is placed at the disposal of the court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Thus, where no debt is due and owing, consignation is not proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>&nbsp; In a valid consignation where the thing sought to be deposited is a sum of money, the amount of the debt due is determinable.&nbsp; Clearly, the subject matter (i.e the amount due) in consignation cases is capable of pecuniary estimation.&nbsp; This amount sought to be consigned determines the jurisdiction of the court.<br><br>In the case at bar, the amount consigned being P5,625.00, the respondent metropolitan trial court correctly assumed jurisdiction over the same, in accordance with Section 33(1) of BP Blg. 129, previously quoted.<br><br>As to petitioner's arguments nos. 2 and 3, considering the reasons for which G.R. No. 78438 was referred by this Court to respondent appellate court, as stated in the resolution of the Court dated 19 August 1987, and further taking into account that no reversible error was committed by respondent Court of Appeals, we find no compelling reason to overturn the ruling in the questioned decision.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the decision of respondent Court of Appeals, dated 25 July 1988, rendered in CA-G.R. SP. No. 12765, which affirmed the judgment of the respondent Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 52, dated 20 March 1987 is hereby AFFIRMED, and the petition in this G.R.
