				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner spouses Antonio and Remedios Soriano in G.R. No. 70937
urge the Court to set aside the Order of the Regional Trial Court of Manila in
LRC Record No. 302 granting a writ of possession to private respondent therein,
the Masantol Rural Bank, Inc. (“Masantol Bank”), which Order was affirmed by
the then Intermediate Appellate Court in its Decision and Resolution in
A.C.-G.R. SP No. 04821.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, petitioner Masantol Bank in G.R. No. 97132
seeks to annul the Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila in Civil Case
No. 84-24524 declaring its auction sale and consolidation of ownership of the
property owned by private respondent Soriano spouses null and void <u>ab</u> <u><span style="">initio</span></u><span style="">, </span>which Decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in
C.A.-G.R. CV No. 21337.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">The spouses Antonio Soriano and Remedios
Soriano had on two occasions, obtained from Masantol Bank three (3) loan
accounts in the aggregate amount of P25,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Each loan was covered by a promissory note and secured by a real estate
mortgage constituted over a parcel of land and house owned by the Soriano
spouses located at 3392 J.C. Cruz, Barrio Obrero, Tondo, Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real estate mortgage contained a special
power of attorney authorizing Masantol Bank to foreclose the property
extrajudicially in the event the Soriano spouses defaulted on their
obligations.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Because the Soriano spouses were unable to pay their indebtedness
on the dates each of the loans respectively fell due, Masantol Bank caused the
mortgaged property to be foreclosed extrajudicially.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The auction sale was initially scheduled for
20 October 1977 but for one reason or another, it did not take place on that
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the auction sale subsequently
held on 22 June 1978, Masantol Bank was the lone bidder and bought the
mortgaged property for the sum of P38,280.44.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Sheriff of Manila who conducted the auction sale then executed a
certificate of sale<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in the name of Masantol Bank which, in turn, had the fact of sale annotated on
the back of the certificate of title standing in the name of the Soriano
spouses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 10 December 1979, Masantol
Bank, as attorney-in-fact, executed a deed of sale<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
assigning the property to itself for failure of the Soriano spouses to redeem
the property within the redemption period of one (1) year from the date the
certificate of sale was registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
deed of sale was presented to the Register of Deeds of Manila who issued
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 136368 in the name of Masantol Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">After it had consolidated its ownership of the Barrio Obrero house
and lot, Masantol Bank filed in the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 4
sitting as a land registration court, an <u>ex</u> <u><span style="">parte</span></u> motion for issuance of a writ of possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The land registration court allowed the Soriano spouses time to controvert the allegations
in the motion filed by Masantol Bank but the period granted them lapsed without
their having filed any pleading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 18
August 1981, the land registration court issued an Order the dispositive
portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, let the corresponding writ of possession be issued
directing the Sheriff of Manila or his duly authorized representative to place
the herein petitioner in possession of the property described in said Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 136368 and to eject therefrom the mortgagors,
occupants, lessees, representatives and all persons claiming rights under them.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Soriano spouses questioned the above Order granting the writ
of possession before this Court in G.R. No. 69171; however, the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> was referred by the Court to the Intermediate Appellate
Court on 26 November 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 November 1984, the Intermediate Appellate Court restrained
the enforcement of the writ of possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The restraining order was later lifted and vacated when the Intermediate
Appellate Court eventually dismissed the petition in its Decision dated 8 April
1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Soriano spouses filed a motion
for reconsideration which was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 May 1985, the Soriano spouses filed with us a petition for
review of the decision and resolution of the Intermediate Appellate Court, now
docketed as G.R. No. 70937.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
issued a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement or implementation of
the writ of possession dated 18 August 1981.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, i.e. on 21 May 1984 pending litigation of the validity
of the writ of possession, Remedios Soriano who had been separated from her
husband for a period of at least one year, filed a complaint in the Regional
Trial Court of Manila, Branch 26, seeking, among other things, the annulment
of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the auction sale held on 22 June
1978 of the foreclosed Barrio Obrero property; (2) the deed of sale executed in
favor of Masantol Bank; and (3) the transfer certificate of title issued in the
name of Masantol Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the issues
were joined, the case proceeded to trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On 20 July 1987, the trial court rendered a decision with the following
dispositive portion:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the trial court’s decision was
affirmed except that the award of P10,000.00 for moral and exemplary damages
was deleted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Masantol Bank accordingly filed the instant Petition for Review
docketed as G.R. No. 97132.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its position

<p class="BODY">Ordinarily, <span style="">G.R. No. </span>97132,
<span style="">as </span>the case with the higher or
later general records number, should have been consolidated with G.R. No.
70937.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since the principal
issue litigated in G.R. No. 70937, i.e., the validity of the writ of possession
issued on the basis of Masantol Bank’s title is peripheral to the principal
issue in G.R. No. 97132 where the validity of Masantol Bank’s title itself is
directly questioned, the Court decided to consolidate G.R. No. 70937 with G.R.
No. 97132.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ultimate question of the validity of Masantol Bank’s title to
the house and lot in Barrio Obrero relates to two (2) issues:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>firstly, the issue of whether or not Masantol
Bank was legally qualified to acquire ownership of the house and lot in Barrio
Obrero; and secondly, the issue of whether or not the necessary notices for the
foreclosure auction sale at which Masantol Bank <span style="">bought </span>the Barrio Obrero real property had been given.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the first issue, the complete text of Resolution No.
168, as amended by Resolution No. 542, of the Municipal Board of the City of

Maria Barcelon, owner of a piece of land in Barrio Obrero, mortgaged the land
to Citizens’ Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. (Citizens’) to secure a loan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citizens’ foreclosed the mortgage
extrajudicially when the loan was not paid.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Citizens’ bought the land at the foreclosure sale and, after expiration
of the period of redemption, sought to consolidate its ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Register of Deeds of Manila refused to
register the consolidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Citizens’
then brought suit against the Register of Deeds and the City of Manila, praying
that Resolution No. 542 of the City of Manila be declared null and void and the
Register of Deeds ordered to register the <span style="">consolidation
</span>of title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge
dismissed the suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, in
affirming the decision of the trial court, held that Citizens’ being a
corporate entity, <span style="">was </span>not
qualified to acquire the lot and hence not competent to raise the question of
invalidity of Resolution No. 542.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
effect, the Court held that only persons qualified under paragraph 4 of
Resolution No. 542 (quoted above) could acquire ownership of a Barrio Obrero
lot whether the sale be a voluntary one or a forced sale on execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Remedios Soriano invokes and relies upon the <u>Citizens</u>’ <u>Surety</u>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, Masantol
Bank, a juridical entity licensed by the Central Bank to operate as a rural
bank, in effect asks us to re-examine and overrule <u>Citizens’ Surety</u> and
to hold that paragraph 4 of Resolution No. 542 is not applicable to a subsequent
purchaser in an auction sale of a mortgaged Barrio Obrero lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the rule in <u>Citizens’ Surety</u> should be
re-affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As noted earlier,
Resolution No. 542, amended Resolution No. 168, as previously amended by
deleting paragraph 6 from Resolution No. 168, which deleted paragraph read as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“6. No lot shall be
transferred, leased, mortgaged or otherwise encumbered without the express
approval of the Mayor of the City of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mortgage or other encumbrance shall not be for an amount greater
than the original purchase price nor for a period of more than five (5)
years:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, that in case
of fore­closure or auction sale, the City of Manila reserves the right to
redeem the lot so foreclosed at not more than the price of its original
acquisition excluding necessary costs and expenses.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clearly, the deleted paragraph 6 had
imposed onerous limit­ations in respect of mortgages established on Barrio
Obrero lots:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the Mayor of the City
of Manila had to approve transfers, leases or mortgages of a Barrio Obrero lot;
(b) a loan secured by the mortgage could not exceed the original purchase price
of the lot nor could the life of the mortgage exceed five (5) years; and (c) in
case of a foreclosure or auction sale, the City of Manila had a right to redeem
the lot at not more than the original selling price to the mortgagor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deletion of paragraph 6 thus indicated an
intent on<span style=""> </span>the part of the
Municipal Board to mitigate the restrictions attaching to Barrio Obrero
lots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the same token, however, the
Municipal Board had the opportunity to exclude foreclosures or auction sales
from the application of paragraph 4; the Municipal Board did not, however,
choose to do so and did not go beyond deleting paragraph 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is aware that the rule in <u><span style="">Citizens’ </span>Surety</u> does not
necessarily make good economic or financial sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">is
</span>not even necessarily good for the Filipino laborers or lowly- paid
employees themselves who must expect to find difficulties in securing bank
credit since banks would naturally be reluctant to accept Barrio Obrero lots as
collateral if the banks cannot bid for such lots even to save themselves from
loss in case of default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there
realistically would not be many Filipino laborers resident in Manila whose
wages do not exceed P<span style="">180.00 </span>a
month or P6.00 a day (or, <u>perhaps</u>, the current minimum daily wage of
P118.00) who would be in a position to bid for and purchase a Barrio Obrero lot
in a foreclosure sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe,
however, that further modification of Resolution No. 168 as amended by
Resolution No. 542 should be left to the Municipal Board of Manila, that the
Municipal Board should be given the opportunity to correct the difficulty posed
by the unqualified language of paragraph 4, just as the Board corrected some of
the difficulties created <span style="">by </span>the
restrictions in the original paragraph 6 of Resolution No. 168.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is essential to note, however, <span style="">that </span>the application of the rule in <u>Citizens’ Surety</u> does
not in any way affect the validity or the enforceability of the mortgage lien
held by Masantol Bank; that mortgage lien continues <span style="">to </span>be good and valid and effective as against the debtor and the
whole world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation secured by
the mortgage remained valid and enforceable and that obligation could be enforced
by foreclosure so long as the successful bidder is a person qualified under
paragraph 4 of Resolution No. 542.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why the sale in favor of the mortgagee
Masantol Bank must be set aside:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Masantol Bank failed to comply with the requirements of
publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Act No. 3135, as amended,
which governs the extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgages <span style="">on </span>real property specifies the
following publication requirements:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice shall be
given by posting notices of the sale for not less than twenty days in at least
three public places of the municipality or city where the property is situated,
and <u>if such property is worth more than four hundred pesos, such notice
shall also be published once a week for at least three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation in the municipality or city</u>.” (Underscoring
supplied)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Republic Act No. 720, as amended, the
Rural Banks Act, provides for exemption of foreclosures of mortgages securing
loans granted by rural banks in the case <span style="">of
</span><u>loans not exceeding P10,000.00</u> (including interest due and
unpaid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loans secured by the
mortgage <span style="">on </span>the Obrero lot in
favor of Masantol Bank were well in excess of P10,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notice of the first auction sale scheduled
for 20 October 1977 had been duly published as required by Section 3 of Act No.
3135, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No auction sale,
however, took place on that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
auction sale during which Masantol Bank bought the property as sole bidder was
conducted eight (8) months later, on 22 June 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Masantol Bank alleged that there was
re-publication of the notice of the 22 June 1978 auction sale; Remedios B.
Soriano contends otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence submitted by Masantol Bank as tending to prove its
compliance with the publication requirement in respect of the 22 June 1978
auction sale, consisted simply of the testimony of Atty. Venancio Viray<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

by a stenographer of the newspaper Economic Monitor.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Remedios Soriano, upon the other hand, presented a solicitor of the Economic
Monitor -- where the notice of auction sale was supposed to have been published
-- who testified that he had not seen from <span style="">their </span>records any document indicating that the notice of auction
sale was in fact published.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled doctrine that <span style="">failure
</span>to publish the notice of auction sale as required by the statute
constitutes a jurisdictional defect which invalidates the sale.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court is not persuaded either that the evidence presented by Masantol Bank
sufficiently established its compliance with the statutory requirement of
notice, or that the testimony of Remedios Soriano’s witness showed non?compliance
with such requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Tambunting
v. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“<u>One issue of a newspaper of general circulation is not
substantial compliance</u> with the <u>required publication of once (1) a week
for at least three (3) consecutive weeks</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners claim the <u>publisher’s affidavit of publication</u> is merely
a customary proof, hence, it should not be considered as the sole evidence of
publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may be so in the
presence of equally convincing evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, however, there is no such other proof of
publication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>To show compliance, the
published notices and certificate of posting by the sheriff of the notice of
sale of 26 January 1968 should have been presented</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not appear in the record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can the sale be considered as an
adjournment of an earlier sale under Sec. 24 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly posed by the Court
of Appeals, why was there one (1) publication of the notice of sale scheduled
on 26 January 1968?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The presumption of
compliance with official duty has been rebutted by the failure to <span style="">p</span>resent proof of posting and
publication of the notice of sale of 26 January 1968.” (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Masantol Bank argues that the issue on publication or re-<span style="">p</span>ublication of notice of auction sale
should not have been passed upon by the Court of Appeals, since that <span style="">issue </span>had not been admitted as such at
the pre-trial of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre-trial
order of the trial court dated 25 April 1985 had narrowed down the issues to
the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the validity of the
auction sale of 22 June 1978; (b) the applicability of Resolution No. 542,
Series of 1956, of the Municipal Board of the City of Manila; and (c) the
amount of damages each party may be entitled to claim from the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the issue of re-publication had not been
specifically identified and included in the above list of issues, that issue is
properly deemed included within the broader question relating to the validity
of the auction sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the question of suspension of the running or accruing
of interest on the loans of the Soriano spouses from Masantol Bank starting
from June 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its questioned
decision, the Court of Appeals ruled that interest at the rate of twelve
percent (12%) per annum was due on each of the loans from the date they were obtained
and <u>until June 1980</u>, when Remedios Soriano first asked for an accounting
of the loan, at the same time offering to pay the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">A mere offer to pay, <u>not</u> accompanied or promptly followed
by consignation in court of the amount tendered but refused by the creditor, is
<u>not</u> sufficient to cause cessation of the running of interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The applicable rule was stated by the Court
in <u>State Investment House, Inc. v. Court </u><u><span style="">of Appeals</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>in the following manner:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Where the creditor unjustly refuses to accept payment, <u>the
debtor desirous of being released from his obligation must comply with two</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(2) <u>conditions</u>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) <u>tender of payment</u>; <u>and</u> (b) <u>consignation
of the sum due</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tender of payment
must be accompanied or followed by consignation <span style="">in </span>order that the effects of payment may be produced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <u>Llamas vs. Abaya</u>, the Supreme
Court stressed that <u>a written tender of payment alone, without consignation
in court of the sum due, does not suspend the accruing of regular or monetary
interest.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the instant case, respondent spouses Aquino, while they are
properly regarded as having made a written tender of payment to petitioner
State, failed to consign in court the amount due at the time of the maturity of
Account No. IF-82-0904-AA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows
that their obligation to pay principal-<u>cum</u>-regular or monetary interest
under the terms and conditions of Account No. IF-82-0904-AA was <u>not</u>
extinguished by such tender of payment alone.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>For the respondent spouses to continue in possession of the
principal of the loan amounting to P110,000.00</u><u><span style=""> </span>and to continue to use the same after maturity of the loan
without payment of regular or monetary interest, would constitute unjust
enrichment</u> on the part of the respondent spouses <u>at the expense of
petitioner State even<span style="">&nbsp; </span>though the spouses
had not been guilty of mora</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
precisely this unjust enrichment which Article 1256 of the Civil Code prevents
by requiring, in addition to tender of payment, the consignation of the amount
due in court which amount would thereafter be deposited by the Clerk of Court
in a bank and earn interest to which the creditor would be entitled.”
(Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both Remedios Soriano and Antonio Soriano had failed to consign
in court the amount due to Masantol Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, regular or monetary interest did not cease to run or accrue
in respect of the loans granted to the Soriano spouses, and it was reversible
error for the Court of Appeals to have held otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Remedios Soriano asks us to restore the award for moral and
exemplary damages made by the trial <span style="">court;
</span>but we see no reason for overturning the Decision of the Court of
Appeals deleting such award.</p>
