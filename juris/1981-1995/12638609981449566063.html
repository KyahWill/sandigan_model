"Field Warehouse Storage Agreement" executed by Luzon Brokerage
Corporation and Pacific Copra Export Co., Inc.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> Under this contract, Luzon
Brokerage Corporation (hereafter simply LUZON) undertook to operate field
warehouses in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City and <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, which were needed by Pacific Copra Export Co.,
Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">hereafter</span>

PACOCO subsequently leased to <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> two (2) warehouses
under separate contracts denominated "Field Warehouse Leases,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Conformably with these arrangements, <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>
received from PACOCO from time to time quantities of <i>copra <span class="SpellE">resecada</span></i> issuing the corresponding Field Warehouse

</span>Two (2) of these receipts were:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) Field Warehouse Receipt No. 917,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Both field warehouse receipts <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i> stipulated that the copra deposited was
"subject to lien for storage, handling and other charges, as per contract

<p class="BODY">After the Field Warehouse Storage Agreement had been in effect
for about four (4) years, LUZON learned that the Manila Banking Corporation had
asked the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> to sell at
public auction 42 tons of the copra deposited at the LUZON?PACOCO
warehouse at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
with a value of not less than P23<span class="GramE">,530.00</span>, in
satisfaction of <span class="SpellE">PACOCO's</span> indebtedness to said Bank.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a>
That indebtedness had been incurred in connection with (1) an Overdraft
Agreement executed between the bank (hereafter simply MANILABANK) to secure
which PACOCO had executed a Deed of Assignment of Inventory, assigning to
MANILABANK all its right, title and interest in and to the 4,100 long tons of
copra valued at P1,500,600.00 deposited in its various warehouses in <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> and Mindanao, including 600 long tons at its
warehouse at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, Davao;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> and (2) and an Amendment of the
Overdraft Agreement in relation to which PACOCO executed a chattel mortgage
over all the copra deposited in its various warehouses, including that at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, Davao.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> forthwith filed suit in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> against MANILABANK, PACOCO
and the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Provincial Sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its complaint,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
LUZON (1) alleged substantially the foregoing facts;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(2) asserted that notwithstanding that under
the terms of its receipts and the Warehouse Receipts Law (Act No. 2137) it had
not only the right to keep the copra in its custody until its lien had been
satisfied, but also the obligation "to deliver ** (the copra) only upon
surrender of the warehouse receipts or ‘upon written order' of the entities
named therein,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> "MANILABANK and/or PACOCO
without satisfying said lien, or surrendering said receipts, or obtaining **
(its) consent or the written order of the entities named therein," were
threatening to cause the sale at public auction of "at least 42 tons of
said copra deposited at the bodega in <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, with a value of not less than P23,530.00;" and
(3) prayed that the Court (a) issue first a preliminary, and later a perpetual,
injunction to restrain the defendants, their agents or deputies from selling
the copra in question and from molesting it in its possession; and (b) condemn
MANILABANK and PACOCO to pay it "not less than P5,000.00 by way of
attorney's fees and other necessary expenses of litigation,” as well as the
costs of suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court issued a
preliminary injunction, as prayed for,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> but this was dissolved not long
afterwards upon agreement of the parties that the sale of the copra should go
on, but the proceeds would remain on deposit with the MANILABANK subject to
final disposition by the Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Only MANILABANK and the Provincial Sheriff filed an answer to the
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its amended answer (with
compulsory counterclaim),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a> MANILABANK -</p>

<p class="BODY">1) admitted having asked its co-defendant, the Provincial
Sheriff, to extra-judicially sell at public auction the copra deposited at the
bodega at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> but
alleged that the request "was within the valid exercise of its rights as
the registered chattel mortgagee and it was under no obligation to secure the
consent of plaintiff or the entities named in the alleged warehouse receipts,
who indisputably possess no right superior to those of the ** (bank);" and
that, moreover, it had never been informed of the existence of the warehouse
receipts or of <span class="SpellE">LUZON's</span> alleged lien <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) averred that the very warehousing agreement between LUZON and
PACOCO provided that there had to be an <i>adjustment of actual cost</i> (of
salaries of employees in the storing and handling of commodities) as well as
the <i>presentation of invoices</i> (for expenses incident to conducting any
warehouse and maintaining possession of the commodities for the benefit of
warehouse receipt holders and the depositor) before the obligations in favor of
LUZON for storage, handling and other charges could become due and demandable;
but no averment to this effect is contained in the complaint which therefore fails,
on this account, to state a cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> found for <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>,
after due proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It declared that
-</p>

<blockquote>... <span class="GramE">the</span> disputed 42 tons of copra could
not have been among those mortgaged by the ** (PACOCO) in favor of **
(MANILABANK).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that under
paragraph (d) of the chattel mortgage executed by ** (PACOCO) in favor of **
(MANILABANK), it was the duty of the former to replace the mortgaged property
with similar property of the same value, kind and quantity should the same be
sold but there is no proof that the 42 tons of copra deposited in the <span class="SpellE">Mati</span> bodega sought to be sold at public auction by
defendant provincial sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> belonged to **
(PACOCO) and were among those mortgaged to the ** (MANILABANK).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Asedillo</span>,
witness for the defendant bank, admitted that he had no way of knowing whether
the copra subject of the suit was included in the 100 long tons of copra
deposited in <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, mortgaged to the ** (MANILABANK)
as appearing in Exhibit 6.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Its judgment declared LUZON entitled to the proceeds of the sale
of the 42 long tons of copra in the amount of P21<span class="GramE">,474.20</span>,
at the time on deposit with the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch of the
Bank of the Philippine Islands, and authorized it (a) to withdraw said amount
from the bank and, (b) after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
amount of P7,300.00 representing storage charges due it, to deliver the
remainder to the party entitled thereto in accordance with the terms of the
corresponding warehouse receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">This judgment, on appeal by MANILABANK,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On motion for reconsideration filed by the bank, however, the
Court rendered a Resolution setting aside its original decision and entering
another, "dismissing the complaint and ordering the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (LUZON), on the appellant's (<span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span>)
counterclaim, to pay ** (the latter) P23,530.00 as actual damages, and
P5,000.00 for and as attorneys' fees and expenses of litigation, and ** the
costs."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
The Resolution sustained <span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span> contention (a)
that the Field Warehouse Storage Agreement satisfactorily demonstrates PACOCO
to be the owner of the 42 tons of copra; (b) that there was no evidence proving
that either <span class="SpellE">Paxsmo</span> Inc. or Wells Fargo Bank --
mentioned in the field warehouse receipts<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> -- ever entered into a pledge
agreement over the copra in question; and (c) that even assuming otherwise, the
pledge could not bind either PACOCO or MANILABANK, they not being parties
thereto.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
It sustained, too, <span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span> argument that the
copra deposited in the bodega at <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>, actually conformed to the
quality of copra mortgaged to the bank, the testimony of its credit
investigator, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Tuazon</span>, to this effect never
having been disputed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> It also found from the evidence
that <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> was not in truth a warehouseman, but merely
an employee or dummy of PACOCO.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> Finally, it ruled that, as
maintained by MANILABANK, the Trial Court's disposition of the proceeds of the
sale was erroneous for, as already stated, (a) <span class="SpellE">Paxsmo</span>
Inc. and Wells Fargo in fact had no existing pledge contract over the copra,
(b) a warehouseman could not set up title to the deposited goods in himself, or
set up a third person's right or title as a defense to an action brought by a
depositor or person claiming under him for the delivery of the goods, and (c)
no one other than MANILABANK had in truth laid claim to the copra, and even
assuming there were other claimants, the remedy of LUZON, as warehouseman, was
to file an action for <span class="SpellE">interpleader</span>, either as an
original suit or as a defense to an action for recovery of the goods deposited.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a>
Subsequently, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> motion for reconsideration was denied for lack of merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>
has appealed to this Court, disputing all the Appellate Court's findings just
specified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a>
Its appeal is <span class="GramE">without<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>merit</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court's findings impugned by <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>
are essentially factual, having been made in relation to the following issues -</p>

<p class="BODY">1) <span class="GramE">whether</span> or not the evidence shows
PACOCO to be the owner of the 42 tons of copra in question;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="GramE">whether</span> or not the evidence
establishes that a pledge had been executed over the copra between <span class="SpellE">Paxsmo</span> Inc., as <span class="SpellE">pledgor</span>, and
Wells Fargo Bank, as <span class="SpellE">pledgee</span>;</p>

<p class="BODY">3) whether or not the evidence shows that the 42 tons of copra
were among those covered by The Deed of Chattel Mortgage executed by PACOCO in
favor of MANILABANK; and</p>

<p class="BODY">4) <span class="GramE">whether</span> or not the proofs adduced by
the parties show that <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> was not a <i>bona fide</i>
warehouseman, but merely an employee or dummy of PACOCO.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusions of the Court of Appeals on the foregoing issues
were reached not only after consideration of the points set forth in <span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span> motion for reconsideration of its original
decision -- as to which LUZON presented no opposition despite having been given
an opportunity to do so -- but also, and more importantly, after another
"thorough examination" and "appraisal," and "careful
analysis" of the evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> Those conclusions, to repeat, are
factual, having been made as regards the truth or falsity of avowed events or
posited actualities, or as regards the respective probative value of the
parties’ testimonial and documentary evidence,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> conclusions requiring prior
calibration of the proofs, i.e., the credibility of witnesses and evidentiary
worth of documents, the existence and relevancy of specific surrounding
circumstances, their relation to each other and to the whole, and the
probabilities of the situation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> And it was on the basis of the
factual conclusions thus arrived at that the Appellate Tribunal ordered
dismissal of <span class="SpellE">LUZON's</span> complaint and condemned it to
pay MANILABANK, on its counterclaim, actual damages, attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation, and the costs of suit .<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, as this Court has time and again stressed, it is axiomatic
that the judgment of the Court of Appeals is conclusive as to the facts and may
not be reviewed by this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> The doctrine is, to be sure,
subject to certain specific exceptions<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a> none of which, however, obtains
here.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> attempt, by an adroit formulation of the issues raised
in its petition and taken up at some length in its brief, to characterize those
issues as legal, instead of factual -- hence properly cognizable by this Court
-- is unconvincing and fails of its purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its arguments on this matter appear to run along two main themes:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the Court of Appeals incurred in error
of law because it reversed, upon <span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span> motion
for reconsideration, earlier findings made in its original decision, and said
Court's reappraisal of the evidence runs counter to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> perception
of how that evidence should be weighed or evaluated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To that end the earlier findings are
repeatedly juxtaposed against those made in the resolution of reversal, and it
is sought to explain in some detail why the former were, in the view of said
petitioner, correct and the latter erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying, however, that every court has the power
and indeed the duty to review and amend or reverse its findings and decisions
when its attention is timely called to any error or defect therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Simply because the Appellate Court has done
that here and revised its earlier findings to reflect what it felt to be a more
correct appraisal of the weight and preponderance of the evidence than it had
originally made, does not justify a recourse to this Court that is normally precluded
by law and rule, absent any showing of grave abuse of discretion or similar
extraordinary circumstance clearly calling for the exercise of this Court's
power of review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still less does the
reconsideration and reversal by the Court of Appeals of its original decision
work a transformation of what were essentially findings of fact into
conclusions of law which may be reviewed by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The most cursory perusal of <span class="SpellE">LUZON's</span> brief will show that, as already stated, the
findings complained of were made upon such disputed matters of fact as who
actually owned the copra subject of the parties' contending claims, whether or
not it was covered by the chattel mortgage executed by MANILABANK in favor of
PACOCO, and whether PACOCO is a bona fide warehouseman or merely an employee or
dummy of LUZON.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence <i>pro and con</i>
as to such <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> facts having been received,
and been passed upon by the Court of Appeals in arriving at its now-questioned
findings, this Court will not undertake to review those findings merely because
the petitioner accounts them erroneous based on its own perception of the
relative worth and weight of such evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, a review of the record shows no substantial reason
to reverse or modify in any way the Appellate Court's questioned Resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is
