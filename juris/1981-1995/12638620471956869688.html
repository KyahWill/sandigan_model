several hearings, both parties were required to submit their respective

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">  On October 30, 1986, Minerva Peran, the
representative of the employees during the proceedings before the hearing
officer, filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion to dismiss claiming that Samahan ng

employees allegedly belong, and petitioner employer were able to </span>settle
amicably their dispute through a compromise agreement [Rollo, p. 24, Petition,
Annex"E".] The employees opposed the motion on the ground that
Minerva Peran was not authorized to enter into the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">a</span>lleged compromise agreement and much less to move for the
dismissal of the complaint.  On January
20, 1987, the Regional Director rendered a decision [Rollo, p. 37, Petition,
Annex "H"] denying the motion to dismiss and directing petitioner to
pay the employees their various claims amounting to P625,000.94.  On appeal, the Secretary of Labor affirmed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the decision of the Regional Director.  The two motions for reconsideration of the
order of the Secretary having been denied, the present petition was filed on
November 24, 1987 before the Court, alleging lack of jurisdiction and/or grave
abuse of discretion on the part of the Secretary of Labor in affirming the
decision of the Regional Director.  The
prayer in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petition for the issuance of a temporary

through their representative Minerva Peran.  According to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">etitioner, with the execution of the amicable
settlement, the employees’ com</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">laint was rendered moot and academic and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">petitioner's submission </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">  Indeed, on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">October 29, 1986, Minerva </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Peran
signed an agreement with petitioner reducing their claims from </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

[Rollo, pp. 24-26.] Peran signed as president of the SAMAHAN which had
allegedly disaffiliated from respondent KAMPIL-KATIPUNAN.  However, Peran failed to show any evidence
that SAMAHAN </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">had </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">indeed disaffiliated from
KAMPIL-KATIPUNAN.  More im</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ortantl</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">y,</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
the employees denied giving Peran the authority to enter into the amicable
settlement and to move for the dismissal of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule in this jurisdiction is that money claims due to
laborers cannot be the object of settlement or compromise effected by the
union, union officers or counsel without the specific individual consent of
each laborer concerned [Danao Development Corp. v. NLRC, G.R. Nos. L-40706-7,
February 16, 1978, 81 SCRA 487.] This is so because the aggrieved parties are
the individual complainants themselves.  Their representative can only assist but not decide for them [Kaisahan
ng mga Manggagawa sa La Campana v. Sarmiento, G.R. No. L-47853, November 16,
1984, 133 SCRA 220.] In the light of the categorical denial by the employees
that Peran was authorized to enter into an amicable settlement as regards their
claims, the Court holds that public respondent Secretary of labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ruled correctly in upholding the Regional
Director's rejection of the agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next alleges denial of due process.  It is claimed that when the Regional
Director awarded the employees’ claims in the same order denying Peran’s motion
to dismiss, even in the absence of petitioner's position paper, the latter was
deprived of the right to be heard.  However,
the antecedent facts prove otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the submission by the employees of their position paper on
September 30, 1986, petitioner was required by the hearing officer to submit
his own position paper and supporting documents on or before October 7,
1986.  On said date, petitioner failed
to submit his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">position paper but
instead asked for an extension of seven </span>days within which to submit the
same.  On October 14, 1986, petitioner's
representative failed to appear but the hearing officer accorded him leniency
by resetting the hearing to October 21, 1986.  Despite due notice, petitioner's representative again failed to appear
and submit a position paper.  Consequently, the case was deemed submitted for resolution.  It was then on October 30, 1986 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that Minerva Peran filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">motion to dismiss invoking the disputed</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">amicable settlement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is denial of due
process when a party is not accorded an opportunity to be heard in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a case </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">filed against him [Macabingkil v. Yatco, G.R. No. L-23174, September
18, 1967, 21 SCRA 150, citing the cases U.S. v. Ling Su Fun, 10 Phil. 104
(1908) and Lopez v. Director of Lands, 47 Phil. 23 (1924).] However, what the
law prohibits is the absolute lack of an opportunity to be heard [Batangas,
Laguna, Tayabas and Co. v. Comm-Cadiao, G.R. No. L-28725, March 12, 1968, 22
SCRA 987; Superior Concrete Products v. WCC, G.R. No. L-42020, March 31, 1978,
82 SCRA 270.] Hence, it has been ruled that there </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">no denial of due process where the employer was duly represented by
counsel and given sufficient opportunity to be heard and present </span>his
evidence [Pantranco<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>v. NLRC, G.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">R. No. 64152, </span>December 29, 1983, 126
SCRA 526] nor where the employer's failure to be heard was due to the various
postponements granted to it [Kiok Loy v. NLRC, G.R. No. 54334, January 22,
1986, 141 SCRA 179] or to his repeated failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to appear during the hearings [Divine Word High School v. NLRC, G.R.
No. 72207, August 6, 1986, 143 SCRA 346.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner, in this case,
was given at least three</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">chances by the hearing officer to submit his
position paper but failed each time.  Even prior to the hearing officer’s order for the submission of the
position paper, petitioner was given the opportunity to traverse the employees’
complaint when he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ordered to comment on the employees’
computation of their claims submitted on August 20, 1986.  The comment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">never submitted
since petitioner failed to appear during the two hearings set for the purpose,
despite due notice.  Clearly, petitioner
was granted ample opportunity to present his case before the Regional Director.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, petitioner
appealed the decision of the Regional Director with the Secretary of
Labor.  Two motions for reconsideration
were likewise filed from the Secretary of Labors order of affirmance.  Whatever defect the Regional Director
committed based on an alleged denial of due process was deemed cured by the
filing of an appeal and the motions for reconsideration [De Leon v. Commission
on Elections, G.R. No. 56968, April 30, 1984, 129 SCRA 117; Remerco Garments
Manufacturing v. Minister of Labor and Employment, G.R. Nos. 56176-77, February

Director/Minister of Labor, G.R. No. 54285, December 8, 1988.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Finally, petitioner

affirmative relief against his opponent and, after obtaining or failing to
obtain such relief, repudiate or question that same jurisdiction (Dean vs.
Dean, 136 Or. 694, 86 A.L.R. 79).  In
the case just cited, by way of explaining the rule, it was further said that
the question whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>court had
jurisdiction either of the subject-matter of the action or of the parties is
barred from such conduct not because the judgment or order of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court is valid and conclusive as an
adjudication, but for the reason that such a practice can not be tolerated -
obviously for reasons of public policy.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, it has also been held that after voluntarily
submitting a cause and encountering an adverse decision on the merits, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>too late for the loser to question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>jurisdiction or power of the court

afterwards deny that same jurisdiction to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Elaborating on this ruling, the Court in <u>Crisostomo</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>CA</u>, G.R. No. L-27166, March 25, 1970, 32 SCRA 54, 60, stated that:</p>

<blockquote>The petitioners, to borrow the language of Mr. Justice Bautista
Angelo (People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">vs. </span>Archilla,
G.R. No. L-15632, February 28, 1961, 1 SCRA 699, 700-701), cannot adopt a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">posture </span>of double-dealing without
running afoul of the doctrine of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">estoppel.  The principle of estoppel is in the interest
of a sound administration of the laws.  It should deter those who are disposed to trifle with the courts by
taking inconsistent positions contrary to the elementary principles of right

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A reading of the
above-quoted statements may give the impression that the doctrine applies only
to the plaintiff or the party who, by bringing the action, initially invoked

raising the issue of jurisdiction [Tolentino v. Escalona, G.R. No. L-26886,

participation of the party against whom the action was brought, coupled with
his failure to object to the jurisdiction of the court or quasi-judicial body

<blockquote>Social justice would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a
meaningless term </span>if in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>situation
like the present, an element of rigidity would be affixed to procedural
precepts and made to cover the matter.  Flexibility should not be ruled out.  Precisely, what is sought to be accomplished <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">such a fundamental
principle expressly so declared by the Constitution (Article, II Section 5,
[1935] Constitution of the Philippines) is the effectiveness </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the community's effort to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">assist
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the economically </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">underprivileged.  For </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">under existing
conditions, without such succor and support, they might not, unaided, be able
to secure justice for themselves.  To
make them suffer, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">even inadve</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rten</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">tly, from the effect of a judicial ruling, which perhaps they could not
have anticipated, the Dequito decision having been promulgated only last March
28th, when such a deplorable result could be avoided, would be to disregard
what the social justice concept stands for.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, there is equally the obligation on the part of the State
to afford protection to labor (Article XIV, Section 5, [1935] Constitution of
the Philippines).  The responsibility is
incumbent then, not only on the legislative and executive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">branches but also on the judiciary, to
translate this pledge into </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">living
reality.  The present case is an
appropriate occasion for the discharge of such </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">trust.  To preclude relief under
the circumstances herein dis</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">closed
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">would be to fail to submit to
the dictates of a plain constitutional command.  That we should not allow to happen. [Carillo v. Allied Worker's
Association of the Philippines, <u>supra</u>, at pp. 573-574.]<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar, the
various money claims of </span>the employees were never disputed by petitioner
during the proceedings before the Regional Director and the Secretary of
Labor.  What was sought was the
reduction of petitioner's liability by entering into an amicable settlement
with the representative of the employees who turned out to be not
authorized.  Having failed in his
attempt to reduce the claims of the employees, the ends of justice and equity
require that petitioner be not allowed to defeat the employees’ right by the
expedient of raising the issue of jurisdiction.</p>
