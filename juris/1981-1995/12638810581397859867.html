both of the INP, <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City Station and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Aludio</span> Torres of the PC, were fatally hit and who died

<blockquote>"That the crime was committed with the qualifying circumstance
of treachery, considering that they used means and methods, in the execution
thereof, tended directly and specially to insure its execution, without risk to
themselves arising from the defense which the victims might have made, and the

14 of the same Code, there being no aggravating nor mitigating circumstance

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During which investigation, he confessed that
<span style="">he s</span>urrendered to Governor <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagrado</span> of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental in connection with the ambush <span style="">of </span>a group of police and PC soldiers at
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangay</span> on March
31, 1984 which resulted in the death of two policemen and a PC soldier (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A, Records).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his extra-judicial confession, he admitted that he was a
member of the NPA, having joined the same on December 5, 1982; that while a
member of the NPA, he was assigned to collect rice from people in the barrio;
that in March, 1984, his group consisting of 23 persons, two of whom were women,
staged an ambush of the PC soldiers and the police at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sangay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City; that
the ambush was planned by Bert Dingding and Ronie Aljo; that the men carried
armalite or garand <span style="">while </span>the
women carried .38 caliber guns; and that he learned that PC Sgt. Torres was one
of the casualties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that before the start of the investigation, <span class="SpellE">Pcpl</span>. Santos apprised appellant of his constitutional
rights to counsel of <span style="">his </span>own
choice and if he did not have one a certain Atty. Fernando Fuentes III of the
CLAO will be his lawyer who will help him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He agreed to have Atty. Fuentes as his lawyer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he was informed of his right to
remain silent or not to answer any questions if he did not like to answer or if
he had nothing to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he
was warned that his statement may be used as evidence against him before the
court (Exhibit "A," pp. 4-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September
16, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that Atty. Fuentes III assisted appellant
during the entire investigation which lasted for about an hour (pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="9">September 16,
 1988</st1:date>; p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1989</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the investigation, appellant signed his
extra-judicial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty.
Fuentes III also signed the document (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"A," p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 16, 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, two
policemen escorted appellant to the Office of City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Luzminda</span>
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> for him to swear to his written confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before swearing in appellant, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> verified whether the statements therein were indeed his.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, the prosecution presented the following witnesses,
Benjamin <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">delos</span></span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Luzminda</span> <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Magdaleno</span> Velasquez, Teresa <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span>,
Atty. Fernando Fuentes III, and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span>
Gallardo and offered Exhibit "A" which was the affidavit executed by
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense evidence consisted only of the
testimony of appellant who said that he was in his house and worked on his
cornfield the whole day of <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="3">March 31,
 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that
although he was given a lawyer before the investigation, he had none during the
investigation because Atty. Fuentes went out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, he claimed that Atty. Fuentes was not his choice but the
policemen’s choice.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal to the Court of Appeal<span style="">s,</span> appellant raised the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>The <st1:street><st1:address>Lower Court</st1:address></st1:street>
erred in basing its decision of conviction of appellant solely on Exhibits <span style="">"A" and "A-1" alleged
extra-judicial </span>confession of accused during the investigation at the
city jail.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The <st1:street><st1:address>Lower Court</st1:address></st1:street>
erred in relying on the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution instead
of weighing the evidences adduced during the trial in favor of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30, pp.
2-3, Appe<span style="">lla</span>nt<span style="">'s</span> Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before this Court, he reiterated the following assignment of
error:</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Honorable Court of Appeals
grievously erred in affirming the decision appealed from and in admitting and
giving credence (to) the extrajudicial confession, marked (as) Annexes
"A" and "A-1" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 50).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that the fate of the appellant in this case lies
with the admissibility or non-admissibility of his extra-judicial
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant impute
involuntariness to said confession because he was allegedly denied his
constitutional right to counsel during his custodial investigation by the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that the lawyer
assigned to him did not actually attend the investigation as the latter went
out and that said lawyer was not his choice and was only forced on him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records of the case belie this claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Fuentes III, who was presented by the
prosecution, categorically testified:</p>

<blockquote>FISCAL YBANEZ:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style="">.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Atty.
Fuentes III, before affixing your signatures, do you remember if the accused in
this case was ever asked some questions with respect to this affidavit taken?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Will you kindly tell the Honorable
Court as to what was asked?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
<span style="">the </span>investigation started there
in the City Jail, the investigating officer inquired to the accused his right
and that he was asked if he is willing to be assisted by counsel of the
government and he <span style="">said yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>So that person subject of that
investigation whose name <span class="SpellE">Parojinog</span>, assisted by this
representation was then investigated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact the confession of the accused was typewritten (pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="9">September 16,
 1983</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty.
Fuentes III reiterated:</p>

<blockquote>COURT: (to witness)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said you assisted a person during the investigation, were you asked by the
accused to assist him?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
according to the policemen, there was somebody who was willing to give
confession, so when I arrived there, the accused in this case was introduced to
me so I inquired them whether the accused was willing to be assisted by
counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
did they say?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
said, yes, he agreed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">You </span>did not advise him what to do as
assisting counsel under custodial investigation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
told him that he has the right to remain silent but the accused told me that he
was willing to give his confession <span style="">voluntarily,
</span>so they <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> the investigation in my
presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
ibid)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above testimony sufficiently discredited appellant's denial
that he agreed <span style="">to </span>be assisted by
Atty. Fuentes III during his custodial investigation and his claim that Atty.
Fuentes III was not present during said investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Luzminda</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
before whom <span style="">accused-</span>appellant
swore his testimony declared in court that she first informed him of his
constitutional right to be assisted by counsel to which appellant replied that
he was assisted by Atty. Fuentes III during the investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then read the contents of the affidavits
in the dialect one by one and asked appellant if all the answers given were
his, to which appellant answered yes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. <span style="">9, </span><span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, June 24, 1988).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent his claim that Atty. Fuentes was not his choice, Section
12(1) of Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec.<span style=""> </span>12(1).</span>
-- Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have
the right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to have competent
and independent counsel preferably of his own choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the person cannot afford the services of
counsel he must be provided with one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These rights cannot be waived except in writing and in the presence of
counsel."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is very clear from the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision that a person under investigation for the commission of an offense
may choose his own counsel but if he cannot afford the services of counsel, he
must be provided with one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the
initial choice of the lawyer in the latter case is naturally lodged in the
police investigators, the accused really has the final choice as he may reject
the counsel chosen <span style="">for </span>him and
ask for another one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant
case, the records show that no objection was voiced by the accused throughout
the entire proceedings of the investigation and afterwards <span style="">when </span>he subscribed to its veracity
before City Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Luzminda</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he
apparently acquiesced to the choice of the investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He complained for the first time that Atty.
Fuentes was not his choice only during trial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it was too late.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worthy of note is the fact that accused did not categorically
claim that he was intimidated or forced to give his extra-judicial
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he claim that he
was promised any reward or leniency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
settled rule is that a confession <span style="">is </span>admissible
until the accused successfully proves that it was given as a result of
violence, intimidation, threat or promise of reward <span style="">or </span>leniency (People v. Francisco, et al., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-4258, </span><st1:date year="1953" day="15" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 15, 1953</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">; People v. <span class="SpellE">Candava</span>, G.R. L-18517; </span><st1:date year="1964" day="31" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 31, 1964</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">;
People v. Dorado, G.R. No.</span> L-23464, <st1:date year="1969" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1969</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For failure of the accused to successfully assail the <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> of his confession, this Court cannot set it
aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> uncorroborated alibi
that he was elsewhere at the time of the ambush could not prevail over his own
admission that he was one of those who ambushed the group of police and PC
soldiers in March, 1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is a weak
defense in the light further of the fact on record that accused himself
surrendered to Governor <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Sagrado</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental <span style="">in </span>connection with the aforesaid ambush.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused did <span style="">not </span>assail this fact nor explain that he came into the fold <span style="">of </span>the law in some other way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance <span style="">serves </span>to underscore the veracity of the voluntary
confession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defense of alibi
apparently <span style="">is </span>due <span style="">to </span>the change of heart of the accused
upon learning of the afflictive penalty for such a grievous crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court convicted the accused to only one crime of murder
and sentenced him to suffer an indeterminate imprisonment ranging from ten (10)
years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u>,
as its minimum, to eighteen (18) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day <span style="">of </span><u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u>, as
its maximum, together with the accessory penalties provided by <span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
respondent <span style="">court </span>found the
penalty erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It said that
appellant should be found guilty of three murders as charged <span style="">in </span>the information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The penalty <span style="">for </span>murder, without any modifying circumstance is <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it held that appellant should be sentenced to suffer three <span style="">(3) </span>penalties of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> for the murder of P/Sgt. Alex Velasquez,
P/Cpl. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Carreon</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Aludio</span>
Torres, correctly refraining from entering judgment and forthwith, certified
the case and records for review of this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the foregoing observations of the respondent court
anent the penalty to be imposed on appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of murder
is punishable by <u>reclusion</u> <u>temporal</u> in its maximum period to
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the aggravating
circumstance of band has been offset by the mitigating circumstance of
voluntary surrender, the penalty that should be imposed on appellant is <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, conformably with People v. Munoz, et
al., G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-38969-70, </span><st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="2"><span class="GramE">February 9, 1989</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 170 SCRA 107.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, the civil indemnity for the death of the three lawmen
should be increased to P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> each, conformably
with the latest policy of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the judgment of conviction against
accused-appellant is AFFIRMED with the modifications that the accused-appellant
