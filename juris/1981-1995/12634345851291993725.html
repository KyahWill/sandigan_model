				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case demonstrates once again the acute housing problem in
the urban areas and the bitterness that characterizes the struggle for a roof
over one's head as part and parcel of the right to a decent life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject of this controversy is a 4-unit apartment building
located at Makisig Street in Sta. Mesa, Sampaloc Manila.  It was originally owned by private
respondent Jose Ortañez and leased separately to the three petitioners herein,
namely, Consuelo Reyes, Mario Francisco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and
</span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">late Felix Berceño (now </span>represented
by his daughter Marila) and private respondent Angel Aseoche.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated October 2, 1980, Ortañez offered to sell the
building to the said lessees for P150,000.00 and gave them 30 days within which
to reply.  In due time, Reyes and Aseoche
wrote separately to Ortañez indicating their interest in purchasing the units
they were respectively occupying.  Francisco and Berceño did not respond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reyes did not pursue her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">intention
to purchase </span>her unit.  Aseoche,
for his part, negotiated with Ortañez and when o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">ffered the </span>option to buy the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">entire </span>building, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">asked
for </span>the reduction of the purchase price to P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">120,000.00.  O</span>rtañez <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">agreed </span>and accordingly they executed a
Deed of Absolute Sale on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January </span>29,
1981.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Aseoche made a down payment of P80,000.00 on that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> date </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and paid the </span>balance
of P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">40,000.00 </span>sometime in May<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> 1981.  Afterwards </span>he had the property <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">registered and a new certificate </span>of title wee issued in his
name.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On </span>May 31, 1981,
Aseoche notified the petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in
writing </span>that he was now the owner of the whole building; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">later at his request, they attended </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">meeting at which he showed them his muniments to the </span>said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">property.  In July of the </span>same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">year,
he informed the petitioners that </span>he was intending <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>renovate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the building and advised them to </span>look for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another place where </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">they </span>could stay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">temporarily.  In </span>December 1981, he told <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">them
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to vacate their </span>respective
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">units </span>within 90 days <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">because the premises would be </span>occupied
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by his </span>son, brother and sister.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioners
had filed </span>on October 16, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1981, a

exception <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to the </span>general

<blockquote>CONSUELO G. REYES</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If it be true that she authorized Aseoche to represent her and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the other </span>petitioners, the Court can
only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">wonder why she still </span>felt
it necessary to write her own <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">separate
reply to Ortañez.  To add to </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">confusion, </span>the other petitioners now
submit that Reyes wrote that letter not only on her own behalf but also of
theirs, as manifested in the use of the pronoun "we" to refer to all
three of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, the letter was signed only by Reyes and there was no
specific reference therein to either Francisco or Berceño by name.  Reyes obviously used the collective pronoun
to refer to her family when she wrote of "the tenanted premises... which
we are at present occupying at No. 618-B." Neither the Francisco family
nor the Berceño family was living with Reyes in Apartment 618-B.  Berceño occupied Apartment 618 and Francisco
Apartment 618-A.  The petitioners' claim
that the Reyes's letter was written for all of them would also contradict their
own contention that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">they </span>authorized
Aseoche as their trusted neighbor to speak and negotiate for all of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' imputation of bad faith to Aseoche has not been
satisfactorily established.  Their claim
is that they came to know about the offer only from the late Felix Berceño who
accidentally learned this from Ortañez.  It was only when they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">verified </span>this
matter with Aseoche that they first saw the letter addressed "To All
Tenants" that had been sent through him by Ortañez.  Even if this were true the non-delivery of
the letter would nevertheless not amount to bad faith as it has not been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shown </span>to be deliberate.  Indeed, Aseoche did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">deny such letter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">when as</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">k</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">ed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">about it </span>by the petitioners.  In fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">they </span>testified that Aseoche readily showed them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the letter </span>and Reyes even got a copy
of it which she presented at the trial as one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of her </span>exhibits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' contention that Aseoche was a confidante of
Ortañez was refuted by Atty. Ramon Carpio, who testifed that Aseoche was
employed not by private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondent </span>Ortañez
but by the Ortañez University which was managed and administered solely by
Ortañez's brother.  The collection <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>rentals by Ortañez until May 1981 is
explained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by the </span>fact that
Aseoche completed his payment of the purchase price only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>May 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear that it was the trial court that has
misapprehended the facts, making it necessary for the respondent court to
rectify them.</p>

<p class="BODY">So much then for the facts, now for the legal issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">first </span>issue is
whether <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">or not there </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was a </span>perfected agreement to sell
between the petitioners and Ortañez that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was
</span>violated with the sale of the entire building by Ortañez to Aseoche.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter sent by Ortañez to the petitioners Aseoche <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">read as follows:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>Trusting that you are sufficiently advised.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yours very truly,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(SGD.) JOSE S. ORTAÑEZ</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As it has already been shown that petitioners Francisco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and Berceño were not represented </span>by
either Aseoche or Reyes, the conclusion must follow that they never responded
to Ortañez's offer and so could not have accepted the same.  It is true that they testified to having
verbally manifested their acceptance to Ortañez but they have nothing to prove
this beyond their own self-serving assertion.  Moreover, this claim has been denied by Carpio, who testified as
administrator of Ortañez's properties, including the building in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for Aseoche and Reyes, their separate responses merely
indicated their <u>interest</u> in buying their respective <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">units.  Reyes in fact inquired about the details of the sale of her unit because
the property had not yet been subdivided.  Beyond that, Reyes did nothing more.  Aseoche, for his part, pursued his interest and started negotiating with
Ortañez, resulting in the sale of the entire property to him at the reduced
price of P120,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Reyes’s letter to Ortañez
did not have the effect of perfecting any contract to sell because there was no
meeting of the minds between them regarding the subject matter of the sale and
the consideration therefor.  All she
indicated was an interest in buying, which was not a definite commitment to buy
pending determination of the price of her unit.  This could not be reached by simply dividing the offered purchase
price of P150,000.00 because the unit occupied by Aseoche was bigger than the
other three units occupied by the petitioners.  Hence, the respondent court was correct in holding:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It is apparent in the aforequoted letter-reply that there was no
acceptance of the offer by plaintiff-appellee Reyes as what she manifested
therein was only an "interest to purchase the said unit.” An interest to
purchase is certainly different from an acceptance of the offer to sell.  The letter-offer to sell not having been
accepted there was no perfected agreement to sell between plaintiff-appellee
Reyes and defendant Jose Ortañez.  An
unaccepted offer to sell creates no legal bond.  It is the acceptance of the offer that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">gives </span>life to juridical obligation (Baroque vs. Marquez, et al.,
[CA] 37 O.G. 1911).  Only an absolute or
unqualified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">acceptance </span>of a
definite offer manifests the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">consent
necessary </span>to perfect a contract (Weldon Construction Corp. vs. Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Appeals, </span>154 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">SCRA 618).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners also assert that the sale between Aseoche <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>Ortañez was tainted with fraud and
bad faith because:  a) Aseoche pursued
his own selfish motives instead of protecting their common interest; b) Ortañez
offered to sell the apartment for P150,000.00 to all the tenants but sold it
only to Aseoche and, worse, for only P120,000.00 and on installment basis; and
c) the absolute deed of sale stated that the whole consideration of P120,000.00
was paid to the vendor on January 29, 1981, although Aseoche paid the balance
only in May 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">The kind of fraud that will vitiate a contract refers to those
insidious words or machinations resorted to by one of the contracting parties
to induce the other to enter into a contract which without them he would not
have agreed to.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, even assuming that the acts mentioned above constituted bad faith,
they nonetheless cannot be the "fraud" contemplated by Art. 1338 of
the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the party entitled to invoke fraud or bad faith as a
ground for nullifying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>contract
is the one who was tricked into giving his consent thereto.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Strangers to a contract cannot sue either or both of the contracting parties to
annul and set aside the same except when he is prejudiced in his rights with
respect to one of the contracting parties and can show detriment which would
positively result to him from the contract in which he has no intervention.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Such exception does not obtain in this case because no right was acquired by
the petitioners in the subject property that could be prejudiced by the
questioned contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">What we see here is that the petitioners decided to challenge the
sale between the private respondents only because and after they were asked to
vacate the subject property although they had not earlier manifested or pursued
any interest in buying it when it was formally offered for sale to them.  The facts as appreciated by the respondent
court and the principles governing consent as an essential requisite of a valid
contract must operate against them.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
