private respondent Consolidated Bank and Trust Company (hereinafter
"Consolidated Bank") filed a complaint<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
for a sum of money with prayer for a writ of preliminary attachment against <span class="SpellE">Perlon</span> Textile Mills and its directors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Roberto Ting, a director, was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
with his wife Dolores Lim Ting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint recites that the wife was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as a
party defendant in order to bind their conjugal partnership of gains which
allegedly <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span> from the transactions subject of
the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses Ting are the
present petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consolidated Bank actually sued on two (2) causes of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first was <span class="SpellE">targetted</span>
at recovering on several promissory notes the amount of P2,972,955.51,
allegedly obtained for the defendant corporation by its duly authorized
officers Lu Cheng <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teng</span>
See, and Roberto Ting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These officers
allegedly signed the promissory notes in their personal and official capacities
thereby binding themselves jointly and severally to Consolidated Bank for the
payment of the promissory notes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second cause of action dwells on several violations of trust
receipt agreements which the defendant corporation executed in favor of
Consolidated Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
corporation's faithful compliance with the trust receipt agreements appears to
have been secured by the continuing guaranty of defendants Liu <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> Lin, Angelo <span class="SpellE">Leonar</span>, and Lu
Cheng <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the application for preliminary attachment,
Consolidated Bank averred the ground of "fraud in contracting an obligation"
thus -</p>

<blockquote>16.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants are guilty of
fraud in contracting their obligations more specifically illustrated by their
violation of the trust receipt agreement which is a ground defined under Sec.
1, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1981</st1:date>,
acting on the application for a writ of attachment by Consolidated Bank, the
respondent judge issued the orders under question, to wit:</p>

Spouse, Liu <span class="SpellE">Suy</span> Lin and Spouse, and Yap Chi and
Spouse, within your province to the value of said demands, and costs of suit,
and that you keep safely the same according to the Rules of Court, unless the
defendant - gives security to pay such judgment as may be recovered in this
action in the manner provided for by the Rules of Court; and that you return
immediately this order after executing the same with a full statement of your
proceedings and a complete inventory of the properties attached.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1982</st1:date>,
acting on the petitioners' Motion to Quash Attachment, the respondent judge
issued a second order, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Acting on defendants Roberto
and Dolores Ting's motion to quash attachment and plaintiffs' opposition
thereto, it appearing from plaintiffs' allegations that the alleged fraud was
effected through the collective action of the defendants, the court finds the
motion to be without sufficient merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1982</st1:date>,
acting on the petitioners' motion for reconsideration, the respondent judge
issued the last disputed order the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, under the circumstances, and finding no sufficient
justification for the reconsideration of the order of <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="3">March 3, 1982</st1:date>, the motion for reconsideration is
hereby DENIED.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners came to this Court via a petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are questioning the writ of preliminary
attachment principally on the ground that the application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
hinges on "fraud in contracting” the trust receipt agreements under the
second cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the petitioners are <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the complaint
merely under the first cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the petitioners challenge the writ of preliminary attachment
issued because, in effect, it pierced the veil of corporate fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners explain that the corporation
alone should be held liable for the violation of the trust receipt agreements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the petitioners ask that the writ of preliminary
attachment be struck down by this Court because it authorized an attachment
over the petitioners' conjugal partnership property.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint did not provide for a sufficient basis for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is not enough for the complaint to ritualistically cite, as here,
that the defendants are "guilty of fraud in contracting an
obligation".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An order of attachment
cannot be issued on a general averment, such as one ceremoniously quoting from
a pertinent rule.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The need for a recitation of factual circumstances that support the application
becomes more compelling here considering that the ground relied upon is
"fraud in contracting an obligation".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complaint utterly failed to even give a hint about what constituted
the fraud and how it was perpetrated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fraud cannot be presumed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge thus failed in his duty to ensure that,
before issuing the writ of preliminary attachment, all the requisites of the
law have been complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He acted in
excess of his jurisdiction and the writ he so issued is thus null and void.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is more, the respondent judge plainly ignored that, as
correctly pointed out by the petitioners, the application for preliminary
attachment rests on "fraud in contracting" the trust receipt
agreements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint itself, save
for the unwarranted sweeping reference to "defendants", alleged that
only Consolidated Bank, as principals, and Liu <span class="SpellE">Suy</span>
Lin, Angelo <span class="SpellE">Leonar</span>, and Lu Cheng <span class="SpellE">Peng</span>,
as guarantors, were privy to the trust receipt agreements under the second
cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Roberto
Ting's involvement is limited only to the promissory notes under the first
cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint thus
relevantly alleges -</p>

<p class="BODY">The sweeping nature of the attachment order probably stemmed from
the respondent judge's failure to detect that the two (2) causes of action had
been <span class="SpellE">misproperly</span> joined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Joinder</span> of causes
of action is, among others, subject to the rules on <span class="SpellE">joinder</span>

And the rule on <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties is enunciated in
Sec. 6, Rule 3, Revised Rules of Court, thus -</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Permissive <span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

arise in the action x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Here, the two causes of action arose from different
transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no "series
of transactions" to speak of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
above all, the complaint can conceivably affect adversely petitioner Roberto
Ting under the first cause of action only but not in the second cause of action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the attachment ordered by the respondent judge called for
the sheriffs to "attach the estate, real and personal of x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Spouses Roberto Ting and
Dolores Lim Ting" (Order of September 23, 1981) likewise gives cause for
this Court to strike it down for being null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attached property of the spouses Ting are
conjugal, the same cannot be validly brought under the painful process of
attachment because:</p>

<blockquote>(a) First, the wife Dolores was <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>
merely because of the fact that she is the spouse of Roberto;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) Second, the conjugal partnership cannot possibly be <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span> (again, here, Consolidated Bank's allegation
that the act of the husband redounded to the benefit of the conjugal
partnership is mere "book form") when the husband binds himself, as
guarantor, because this act does not conserve or augment conjugal funds but
instead threatens to dissipate them<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
by unnecessary and unwarranted risks to the partnership's financial
stability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the husband assumes the
obligation of a guarantor, the presumption that he acts, as administrator, for
the benefit of the conjugal partnership, is lost.</blockquote>
