<p class="BODY">At the organization meeting of the Senate held on August 27,
1992, Senator Romulo in his capacity as Majority Floor Leader nominated, for
and in behalf of the LDP, eight (8) senators for membership in the Commission
on Appointments, namely, Senators Angara, Herrera, Alvarez, Aquino, Mercado,
Ople, Sotto and Romulo.  The nomination
of the eighth senator<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
was objected to by Petitioner, Senator Guingona, as Minority Floor Leader, and
Senator John Osmeña, in representation of the NPC.  To resolve the impasse, Senator Arturo Tolentino proposed a
compromise to the effect that the Senate elect<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"x x x 12 members to the Commission on
Appointments, eight coming from LDP, two coming from NPC, one coming from the
Liberal Party, with the understanding that there are strong reservations
against this proportion or these numbers so that if later on in an action in
the Supreme Court, if any party is found to have an excess in representation,
that the party will necessarily reduce its representation, and if any party is
found to have a deficiency in representation, that party will be entitled to
nominate and have elected by this body its additional representative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The proposed compromise above stated was
a temporary arrangement and, inspite of the objections of Senators Guingona and
Osmeña, to enable the Commission on Appointments to be organized by the
election of its members, it was approved.  The elected members consisted of eight LDP, one LP-PDP-LABAN, two NPC
and one LAKAS-NUCD.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1992, Senator Teofisto Guingona, Jr., in his
behalf and in behalf of Lakas-National Union of Christian Democrats
(LAKAS-NUCD), filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of prohibition to
prohibit the respondent Senate President Neptali Gonzales, as ex-officio
Chairman of the Commission on Appointments, from recognizing the membership of
Senators Alberto Romulo as the eighth senator elected by the LDP, and Wigberto
E. Tañada, as the lone member representing the LP-PDP-LABAN, in the Commission
on Appointments, on the ground that the proposed compromise of Senator
Tolentino was violative of the rule of proportional representation, and that it
is the right of the minority political parties in the Senate, consistent with
the Constitution,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
to combine their fractional representation in the Commission on Appointments to
complete one seat therein, and to decide who, among the senators in their
ranks, shall be additionally nominated and elected thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18 of Article VI of the Constitution of 1987 provides for
the creation of a Commission on Appointments and the allocation of its
membership, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 18.  There shall be a
Commission of Appointments consisting of the President of the Senate as
ex-officio Chairman, twelve senators and twelve members of the House of
Representatives, <u>elected by each house on the basis of proportional
representation</u> from the political parties or organizations registered under
the party list system represented therein.  The Chairman of the Commission shall not vote except in case of a
tie.  The Commission shall act on all
appointments submitted to it within thirty session days of the Congress from
their submission.  The Commission shall
rule by a majority of all the members.  (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the mathematical computation of proportional
representation of the various political parties with elected senators in the
Senate, each of these political parties is entitled to a fractional membership
in the Commission on Appointments as stated in the first paragraph of this
decision.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>  Each political party has a claim to an extra
half seat, and the election of respondents Senator Romulo and Senator Tañada to
the Commission on Appointments by the LDP majority is precisely questioned by
the petitioners because, according to them, it unduly increased the membership
of LDP and LP-PDP-LABAN in the Commission and reduced the membership of the
LAKAS-NUCD and NPC correspondingly.  In
view of the conflicting claims of each of the political parties/coalition duly
represented in the Senate to a fractional membership in the Commission on
Appointments, the election of respondents Senator Romulo and Senator Tañada has
become controversial and its validity questionable.  Hence, this petition.  It
has been established that the legality of filling up the membership of the
Commission on Appointments is a justiciable issue and not a political question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We deem it necessary to resolve the respondents’ argument as to
the nature of the instant petition.  There is no doubt that the issues involved herein are constitutional in
nature and are of vital importance to our nation.  They involve the interpretation of Section 18, Article VI of the
Constitution which creates a Commission on Appointments.  Where constitutional issues are properly
raised in the context of the alleged facts, procedural questions acquire a
relatively minor significance,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and the "transcendental importance to the public of the case demands that
they be settled promptly and definitely brushing aside x x x technicalities of
procedure".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the purpose of resolving the case at bar, the instant
petition may be regarded as one of prohibition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the Senate is claimed to have acted without or in excess of its
jurisdiction when it designated respondent Senator Romulo as eighth member of
the Commission on Appointments, upon nomination by the LDP, and respondent
Senator Tañada as LP nominee, notwithstanding, that, in both instances, LDP and
LP are each entitled only to "half a member".  In the alternative, the petition may be
regarded as one for <i>mandamus,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
in which it is claimed that the LAKAS-NUCD and NPC were unlawfully excluded
from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which each is entitled.  Considering the importance of the case at
bar and in keeping with the Court’s duty under the Constitution to keep the
other branches of the government within the limits of the Constitution and the
laws of the land, this Court has decided to brush aside legal technicalities of
procedure and take cognizance of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues for determination by this Court may be stated as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>1)  Whether the election of Senators Alberto
Romulo and Wigberto E. Tañada as members of the Commission on Appointments is
in accordance with the provision of Section 18 of Article VI of the 1987
Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  If said membership of the respondent
senators in the Commission is violative of the Constitutional provision, did
the respondent Senate act in grave abuse of discretion in electing the
respondent Senators?</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)  If there was grave abuse of discretion by
respondent Senate, acting through the LDP majority, should a writ of
prohibition enjoining, prohibiting and restraining the respondent Senators from
sitting as members of and participating in the proceedings of the Commission on
Appointments be issued?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is an established fact to which all the parties agree that the
mathematical representation of each of the political parties represented in the
Senate is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>LDP<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>7.5</blockquote>

<blockquote>LP-PDP-LABAN <span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  .5</blockquote>

<blockquote>NPC<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  - <span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.5</blockquote>

<blockquote>LAKAS-NUCD<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1.5</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is also a fact accepted by all such
parties that each of them is entitled to a fractional membership on the basis
of the rule on proportional representation of each of the political
parties.  A literal interpretation of
Section 18 of Article VI of the Constitution leads to no other manner of
application than as above.  The problem
is what to do with the fraction of .5 or 1/2 to which each of the parties is
entitled.  The LDP majority in the
Senate converted a fractional half membership into a whole membership of one
senator by adding one half or .5 to 7.5 to be able to elect Senator
Romulo.  In so doing one other party’s
fractional membership was correspondingly reduced leaving the latter's
representation in the Commission on Appointments to less than their
proportional representation in the Senate.  This is clearly a violation of Section 18 because it is no longer in
compliance with its mandate that membership in the Commission be based on the
proportional representation of the political parties.  The election of Senator Romulo gave more representation to the
LDP and reduced the representation of one political party -- either the LAKAS­-NUCD
or the NPC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the claim of Senator Tañada that under the ruling in the case
of Senator Lorenzo Tañada,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and the case of Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, he has a right to be elected as a
member of the Commission on Appointments because of:  (a) the physical impossibility of dividing a person, so that the
fractional membership must be rounded up into one senator; (b) being the sole
elected senator of his party, his party is entitled to be represented in the
Commission on Appointments; (c) having been elected senator, rounding up into
one full senator his fractional membership is consistent with the provision and
spirit of the Constitution and would be in full accord with the principle of
republicanism that emphasizes democracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases of the two former senators mentioned cannot be invoked
as a precedent in support of incumbent Senator Tañada's claim to a membership
in the present Commission on Appointments.  In the time of his illustrious father, out of 24 elected senators in the
upper chamber of Congress, 23 belonged to the Nacionalista Party, while Senator
Lorenzo Tañada, who belonged to the Citizens’ Party, was the lone
opposition.  By force of circumstance,
he became a member of the Commission on Appointments because he alone
represented the minority party.  Had
there been another senator belonging to a party other than the Citizens' Party,
this problem of who should sit as the sole representative of the opposition
party would have arisen.  In the case of
Senator Ponce Enrile, there were two senators elected from the opposition
party, namely, he and Senator Estrada.  Applying the rule of proportional representation mentioned earlier (see
formula), the opposition was entitled to one full member (not a fractional
membership).  Senator Enrile was thus
legally nominated and elected as the minority representative in the Senate.  In the present case, if there were a political
party other than the present four political parties in the Senate, and We
follow Senator Tañada's claim that he is entitled to full membership as lone
representative of his party, We would have the anomally of having 13 senators,
where the Constitution allows only twelve (12) in the Commission on
Appointments.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the respondents' claim to membership in the Commission on
Appointments by nomination and election of the LDP majority in the Senate as
not in accordance with Section 18 of Article VI of the 1987 Constitution and
therefore violative of the same because it is not in compliance with the
requirement that twelve senators shall be elected on the basis of proportional
representation of the political parties represented therein.  To disturb the resulting fractional
membership of the political parties in the Commission on Appointments by adding
together two halves to make a whole is a breach of the rule on proportional
representation because it will give the LDP an added member in the Commission by
utilizing the fractional membership of the minority political party, who is
deprived of half a representation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Section 18 on proportional representation is
mandatory in character and does not leave any discretion to the majority party
in the Senate to disobey or disregard the rule on proportional representation;
otherwise, the party with a majority representation in the Senate or the House
of Representatives can by sheer force of numbers impose its will on the hapless
minority.  By requiring a proportional
representation in the Commission on Appointments, Section 18 in effect works as
a check on the majority party in the Senate and helps to maintain the balance
of power.  No party can claim more than
what it is entitled to under such rule.  To allow it to elect more than its proportional share of members is to
confer upon such a party a greater share in the membership in the Commission on
Appointments and more power to impose its will on the minority, who by the same
token, suffers a diminution of its rightful membership in the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 18 also assures representation in the Commission on
Appointments of any political party who succeeds in electing members to the
Senate, provided that the number of senators so elected enables it to put a
representative in the Commission on Appointments.  Drawing from the ruling in the case of <u>Coseteng vs. Mitra, Jr</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
a political party must have at least two senators in the Senate to be able to
have a representative in the Commission on Appointments, so that any number
less than 2 will not entitle such a party a membership in the Commission on
Appointments.  This applies to the
respondent Senator Tañada.</p>

<p class="BODY">We lay down the following guidelines accordingly:</p>

<blockquote>1)  In the Senate, a political party or coalition
must have at least two duly elected senators for every seat in the Commission
on Appointments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  Where there are more than two political
parties represented in the Senate, a political party/coalition with a single
senator in the Senate cannot constitutionally claim a seat in the Commission.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">We do not agree with respondents' claim
that it is mandatory to elect 12 Senators to the Commission on
Appointments.  The Constitution does not
contemplate that the Commission on Appointments must necessarily include twelve
(12) senators and twelve (12) members of the House of Representatives.  What the Constitution requires is that there
be at least a majority of the entire membership.  Under Section 18, the Commission shall rule by majority vote of
all the members and in Section 19, the Commission shall meet only while
Congress is in session, at the call of its Chairman or a majority of all its
members "to discharge such powers and functions herein conferred upon
it".  Implementing the above
provisions of the Constitution, Section 10, Chapter 3 of the Rules of the
Commission on Appointments, provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 10.  -- Place of
Meeting and Quorum:  The Commission
shall meet at either the session hall of the Senate or the House of Representatives
upon call of the Chairman or as the Commission may designate.  The presence of at least thirteen (13)
members is necessary to constitute a quorum.  Provided, however, that at least four (4) of the members constituting
the quorum should come from either house.  x x x.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is quite evident that the Constitution does not require the
election and presence of twelve (12) senators and twelve (12) members of the
House of Representatives in order that the Commission may function.  Other instances may be mentioned of
Constitutional collegial bodies which perform their functions even if not fully
constituted and even if their composition is expressly specified by the
Constitution.  Among these are the
Supreme Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Civil Service Commission,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Commission on Election,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Commission on Audit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
They perform their functions so long as there is the required quorum, usually a
majority of its membership.  The
Commission on Appointments may perform its functions and transact its business
even if only ten (10) senators are elected thereto as long as a quorum exists.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may also be mentioned that while the Constitution provides for
equal membership from the Senate and the House of Representatives in the
Commission on Appointments, the senators on the one hand, and the
representatives, on the other, do not vote separately but jointly, and usually
along party lines.  Even if Senator
Tañada would not be able to sit in the Commission on Appointments, the
LP-LDP-LABAN would still be represented in the Commission by Congressman Ponce
Enrile who has become a member of the LP.  On the other hand, there is nothing to stop any of the political parties
from forming a coalition with another political party in order to fill up the two
vacancies resulting from this decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the Constitution intended that there be always
twelve (12) senators in the Commission on Appointments, the instant situation
cannot be rectified by the Senate in disregard of the rule on proportional
representation.  The election of Senator
Romulo and Senator Tañada as members of the Commission on Appointments by the
LDP majority in the Senate was clearly a violation of Section 18 of Article VI
of the 1987 Constitution.  Their
nomination and election by the LDP majority by sheer force of superiority in
numbers during the Senate organization meeting of August 27, 1992 was done in
grave abuse of discretion.  Where power
is exercised in a manner inconsistent with the command of the Constitution, and
by reason of numerical strength, knowingly and not merely inadvertently, said
exercise amounts to abuse of authority granted by law and grave abuse of
discretion is properly found to exist.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing and on the basis of the applicable
rules and jurisprudence on the matter before this Court, We declare the
election of Senator Alberto Romulo and Senator Wigberto Tañada as members of
the Commission on Appointments as null and void for being in violation of the
rule on proportional representation under Section 18 of Article VI of the 1987
Constitution of the Philippines.  Accordingly, a writ of prohibition is hereby issued ordering the said
respondents Senator Romulo and Senator Tañada to desist from assuming,
occupying and discharging the functions of members of the Commission on Appointments;
and ordering the respondent Senate President Neptali Gonzales, in his capacity
as ex-officio Chairman of the Commission on Appointments, to desist from
recognizing the membership of the respondent Senators and from allowing and
permitting them from sitting and participating as members of said Commission.</p>
