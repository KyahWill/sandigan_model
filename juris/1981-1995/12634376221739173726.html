Criminal Case No. 7711 of Branch 2 of the Regional Trial Court of Bohol, filed
on 19 March 1992, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Tagbilaran City charged,
as co-principals based on conspiracy, Vicente Genobia alias "Inting,"
Reynaldo Cajes alias "Gaga," and one Edwin Doe with the crime of
murder for the death of <span style="">Jeremias
Paredes.  Paredes </span>sustained
thirteen stab wounds in different parts of the chest, and one stab wound at the
abdomen, right lumbar region, which caused a part of the small intestine to
protrude.  Alleged as qualifying
circumstances in the information were treachery, abuse of superior strength,
and cruelty.  Eleven of the stab wounds were
small in diameter probably produced by a sharp-pointed instrument (ice pick)
while the other three were one-half-inch wide with clean edges.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 May 1992, a warrant for the arrest of the three above-named
accused was issued but only accused Vicente Genobia was taken into custody as
the other two remained at large.  The
case proceeded only against Genobia who pleaded not guilty at his arraignment
on 29 May 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Trial then ensued and on 28 August 1992, a judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> of
conviction was promulgated against Genobia, the dispositive portion of which
states:</p>

<p class="2Q">"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Court finds the accused Vicente
Genobia guilty of the crime of MURDER punished under Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code and hereby sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of Reclusion
Perpetua with the accessories of the law and to pay the cost.</p>

<p class="2Q">The accused Vicente Genobia is further ordered to indemnify the
surviving wife of Jeremias Paredes, Teresita Olarte in the amount of Fifty
Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) representing indemnity and damages, without
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The inculpatory evidence against Genobia was established by the
prosecution through the testimonies of Eduardo Cajes and Juanito Banaag who
professed to be with Genobia and the victim prior to the discovery of the
latter's dead body.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 March 1992, Banaag, a cockfighting aficionado who resides
along Dampas Road, Tagbilaran City, went home elated as his two cocks had won
in a cockfight.  To celebrate the
occasion, he invited Eduardo Cajes who lives about 25 meters from his house,
two security guards from the motor pool, and a driver of a pedicab to partake
of some liquor and of the vanquished cocks which were given to him as the owner
of the two winning cocks.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At about midnight, the celebrators went outside to continue their
drinking spree as they felt warm inside the house.  However, the two security guards and the driver of the pedicab
left leaving only Banaag and Eduardo Cajes.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Shortly thereafter, the latter two saw Genobia, Reynaldo Cajes (who is the
younger brother of Eduardo), and a person known only as Edwin drinking along
the road.  Upon seeing Banaag, Genobia
shouted <i><span style="">"balato."</span></i><span style=""> </span>Banaag obliged and readily gave money
for liquor to one named Junior from Calape who, after buying liquor, left for
the house of his uncle.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> While
the drinking session was going on, Jeremias Paredes passed by and joined the
group.  This prompted Genobia to ask
Banaag who the newcomer was.  When
Banaag answered that he did not know, an altercation ensued between Genobia and
Reynaldo Cajes, <span style="">on </span>one hand, and
Paredes, on the other.  Banaag
admonished them but Reynaldo Cajes brandished a stainless steel kitchen knife
at him, at the same time saying, "Go away, you have no participation in
this."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Accordingly, Banaag desisted upon the advice of Eduardo Cajes who, although
older than Reynaldo Cajes, did not also protest the latter's actions because he
was likewise threatened with a knife and was smaller than Reynaldo Cajes.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the three protagonists pulled and pushed each other
until finally, Reynaldo Cajes and Genobia were able to drag Paredes towards the
Divine Word High School.  At this
juncture, Banaag and Eduardo Cajes left in opposite directions.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Eduardo Cajes was home by 1:00 a.m. of 16 March 1992.  While conve<span style="">r</span>sing with his wife, he noticed the arrival of Reynaldo Cajes
and Genobia.  He overheard Reynaldo
Cajes telling Genobia that "It should not have been done," to which
Genobia replied that they did not know that person.  Then, Genobia asked for water which he and Reynaldo Cajes used to
wash their hands.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Nestor Virtucio was next presented by the prosecution to
testify on the injuries sustained by the victim but his testimony was dispensed
with because the defense admitted the medical certificate attesting to the fact
that the victim suffered fourteen stab wounds, three of which were
one-half-inch wide with clean edges, while the eleven others were small in
diameter, probably produced by a sharp-pointed instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">Capt. Ernesto Cagas, PNP Chief of Operations of the Intelligence
Branch, declared on the witness stand that on 18 March 1992 he investigated
Genobia who told him that he held the victim while the two other suspects,
Reynaldo Cajes and Edwin, stabbed the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> He
also averred that Genobia voluntarily pointed to where the ice pick used to
stab the victim could be found and even went with him to recover it from
Arnulfo Tare with whom the same was allegedly entrusted by Edwin.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Capt. Cagas also said that when he confronted Tare, the latter
told him that he did not know anything about the incident.  But when Genobia told him to surrender the
ice pick, he willingly did so.  Capt.
Cagas identified in court an ice pick shown to him as the one he recovered from
Tare.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Genobia denied any participation in the
killing of Paredes and gave a different version of the incident on the witness
stand.  He said that on 15 March 1992 he
was in his house when he was invited at around 10:00 p.m. to drink and partake
of a vanquished cock at the house of Eduardo Cajes by his co-accused Reynaldo
Cajes and one Edwin whose surname he did not know.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
At the house of Eduardo Cajes, Banaag came bringing drinks consisting of two
"long-necks" and two pocket-sized Tanduays.  While engaged in a drinking spree, somebody passed by and Banaag
called for him.  As he did not know the person
called to, he asked Banaag who that person was but the latter replied that he
did not know him.  An altercation then
ensued between Reynaldo Cajes and the newcomer, whom he came to know later as
Jeremias Paredes.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, Reynaldo allegedly dragged Paredes towards the Divine Word High
School.  He denied any participation in
the killing of Paredes and imputed the crime to Reynaldo Cajes and Edwin who
allegedly told him about what they did to Paredes but warned him not to reveal
it to anyone otherwise he would be the next to die.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
When asked about the ice pick, which was presented as Exhibit "B" of
the prosecution, he said that the same was owned by Reynaldo Cajes who left it
with Arnulfo Tare when he fled.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, he said that he learned of the killing of
Paredes at about 1:00 a.m. of 16 March 1992 when Reynaldo Cajes and Edwin went
to his house and told him about it.  He
admitted having been convicted twice for theft by Branch 2 of the Municipal
Trial Court of Tagbilaran City on 30 September 1986 and by Branch 1 of the same
court on 12 August 1987.  He denied at
first that he ever brought along with him a deadly weapon but later admitted
that he was convicted of concealment of a deadly weapon on 25 July 1984.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Having been found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
charged by the trial court, Genobia appealed to this Court raising the
following errors allegedly committed by the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  X X X IN NOT DECLARING THAT THE GUILT OF
DEFENDANT-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME CHARGED WAS NOT ESTABLISHED BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>  2.  X
X X IN NOT DECLARING THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO OVERCOME BY THEIR EVIDENCE
THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESUMPTION OF THE DEFENDANT- APPELLANT'S INNOCENCE."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that there is no direct evidence pointing to
Genobia as one of the perpetrators of the crime, his guilt for the crime
charged has been established beyond reasonable doubt as there is sufficient
circumstantial evidence linking him to it.  Firstly, Genobia and Reynaldo Cajes engaged in a heated altercation with
the victim during a drinking spree after midnight or on the early dawn of 16
March 1992.  Secondly, Genobia and
Reynaldo Cajes forcibly dragged the victim toward the Divine Word High School
where the latter's body was later found on 17 March 1992.  Thirdly, on the same night when the
altercation occurred, Genobia and Reynaldo Cajes went to the house of Eduardo
Cajes who overheard his brother, Reynaldo, say to Genobia, "It should not
have been done," and, thereafter, Genobia asked for water with which to
wash his hands.  Fourthly, during the
investigation, Genobia voluntarily disclosed to Capt. Ernesto Cagas where the
ice pick used in killing the victim was.  It was retrieved from one Arnulfo Tare to whom it had been entrusted by
Genobia.</p>

<p class="BODY">For circumstantial evidence to be sufficient to convict an
accused, it is necessary that these requisites are present:  (a) there must be more than one
circumstance, (b) the facts from which the inferences are derived are proven,
and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce a
conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> Or,
as jurisprudentially formulated, a judgment of conviction based on
circumstantial evidence can be upheld only if the circumstances proven
constitute "an unbroken chain which leads to one fair and reasonable
conclusion which points to the defendant, to the exclusion of all others, as
the guilty person, <i>i.e.</i>, the circumstances proved must be consistent
with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, and
at the same time inconsistent with any other hypothesis except that of
guilty."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing chain of events duly testified to by the
prosecution witnesses is more than sufficient to persuade this Court that
Genobia's guilt has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">To avoid culpability, Genobia attacks the testimony of
prosecution witness Eduardo Cajes as coming from a "polluted source"
and as "self-serving -- for himself as a probable accused and for his
brother who is now a fugitive from justice."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Genobia underscores the testimony of Banaag during the direct examination
wherein he stated that he admonished Genobia and Reynaldo Cajes for their
altercation with Paredes but as a result, Eduardo Cajes "gestured to stab
him" with a stainless steel knife.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> This
gesture, according to him, proves the violent nature and disposition of the
Cajes brothers and casts reasonable doubt on his guilt.  Along with the testimony of the victim's
mother who described Genobia as a friend of her son Jeremias Paredes,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Genobia argues that it cannot be shown from the evidence that he caused the
death of Paredes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, this Court was initially perplexed on why Banaag
declared on direct examination that Eduardo Cajes "gestured to stab
him" with a stainless steel knife when he admonished Reynaldo Cajes and
Genobia about their altercation with Paredes.  It should be noted, however, that in the cross-examination of Banaag, it
was clear that Genobia's lawyer and Banaag understood the latter's testimony to
the effect that it was Reynaldo Cajes, not Eduardo, who brandished the knife at
Banaag.  Hereunder is an excerpt from
the said cross-examination.</p>

<blockquote>"Q  Now, when you saw the altercation according to you, you intervened and
in the process of intervening Gaga Cajes drew the stainless knife and gestured
to stab you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir, that's
correct.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q  </span>Did
he say something at the time when he gestured or when he was attempting to stab
you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He said, "Go away
there, you have no participation in this."</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what was your reaction when you were
delivering in fact giving drinks to them?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I ran towards home.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Definitely
from your own observation, the most angry person thereat was Gaga Cajes, is
that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of his gesture
of stabbing me I presumed that he was aggressive."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Gaga Cajes is accused Reynaldo Cajes.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the transcript of stenographic notes of the portion of the
direct examination of Banaag which mentions Eduardo Cajes as the one who
brandished the knife is probably just a typographical error.  At any rate, Banaag made himself clear in
his cross-examination that it was Reynaldo Cajes who "gestured to stab
him." Therefore, the insinuation of Genobia that Eduardo Cajes is himself a
probable accused is not duly supported by the records, and, hence, no
conclusion can be drawn that his testimony is self-serving.  Nor is his testimony favorable to his
brother, Reynaldo Cajes, for he categorically pointed to the latter as one of
the two persons who dragged the victim towards <span style="">the Divine Word High School, as the knife-wielder, and as the person
who uttered the words:  "It should
not have been done." His disclosures do not serve his brother's
interests.  On the contrary, he clearly
implicated Reynaldo in the gruesome crime despite their brotherly ties.  Thus, rather than indicate bias, his
testimony denotes objectivity and bespeaks nothing but the truth considering
further that it was not shown that he nurtured any serious grudge or hatred
against his brother and Genobia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No improper motive was likewise imputed against the other
prosecution witness, Juanito Banaag, who is Genobia's neighbor.  When there is no evidence, and nothing to
indicate that the witnesses for the prosecution were actuated by any improper
motive, the presumption is that they were not so actuated and their testimonies
are entitled to full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the time-tested jurisprudence is that findings of fact and conclusions
of trial courts on the credibility of witnesses enjoy the highest degree of
respect because the trial courts are in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Genobia has not shown any compelling reason why this rule should not be observed
in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the face of the strong and convincing evidence for the
prosecution establishing Genobia's guilt as a co-author of the crime and his
abject failure to offer sufficient countervailing evidence, his claim that his
co-accused Reynaldo Cajes and Edwin, <span style="">and
probably Eduardo Cajes, are the ones responsible for the death of the victim
does not inspire belief.  It does not
matter that Genobia did not flee, unlike his two co-accused who fled and have
remained at large.  While it is settled
that flight of an accused is competent evidence against him as having a
tendency to establish his guilt,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> non-flight is not conclusive proof of
innocence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, that no one testified as to the details of
the stabbing and no evidence was offered to prove the circumstances of
treachery, abuse of superior strength, and cruelty, such circumstances cannot
be appreciated.  Circumstances which
qualify criminal responsibility must in no case rest upon mere presumption, no
matter how reasonable or probable but must be based on facts of unquestionable
existence.  <span style="">Axiomatic </span>is the rule that the circumstances which would qualify
the killing to murder must be proved as indubitably as the crime itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The doctor who conducted the autopsy of the cadaver of the victim could have
aided the prosecution in proving any of those circumstances.  Unfortunately, the doctor's testimony was
dispensed with.  We have only his
Autopsy Report<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
which indicates that all the stab wounds were frontal but fails to show which
were the fatal wounds.  The number of
wounds does not by itself prove cruelty.  Accordingly, the crime proved is only homicide, not murder.<i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>
