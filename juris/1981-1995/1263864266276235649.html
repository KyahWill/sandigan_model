<p class="BODY">The facts are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>The victim Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>, a member
of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Assistance Force, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sambag</span> I, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City,
arrived home with his friend Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span> at around
11:30 in the evening of March 29, 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was hungry and he asked for food from his wife <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
who said there was none.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim then
decided to buy some viands from a "<span class="SpellE">carinderia</span>"
at the nearby South Expressway Bus terminal located at the left side of </i><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><i>Rizal</i></span><i> Avenue</i></st1:address></st1:street><i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His house is situated in the interior of </i><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><i>Rizal</i></span><i> Avenue</i></st1:address></st1:street><i>,
third from accused-appellant's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The deceased Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> was accompanied
by Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>, with the former walking to his right and his
wife behind him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they were passing in
front of the appellant's house, the latter suddenly appeared and fired a gun at
<span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> hitting him in the left temple.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim staggered and fell to the ground
lifeless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span>
tried to help his companion but the appellant confronted him and pointed the
gun at him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frightened, Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span> fled from the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> rushed to
her husband's side and cradled his head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She heard Sergio <span class="SpellE">Serenio's</span> wife ask her
husband, "<span class="SpellE">Nganong</span> <span class="SpellE">imong</span>
man <span class="SpellE">nang</span> <span class="SpellE">gipusil</span>" (Why
did you shoot them?) to which the accused-appellant replied:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Kinsa</span> man god
<span class="SpellE">sila</span>" (Who are they anyway?) <span class="GramE">(p.
4, <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief.)</span> <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span>
shouted for help but nobody came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So she
ran to her house to summon help.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The version of the defense as testified to by the appellant and his
wife, <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span>, is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>That her husband, a dental technician, worked on orders for
dentures the whole day of March 21, 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On that fateful evening, accused went to sleep at </i><st1:time minute="0" hour="20"><i>8:00 o'clock P.M.</i></st1:time><i>, until he was
awakened by the police at dawn the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That sometime before </i><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><i>midnight</i></st1:time><i>, she was awakened by the <span class="GramE">sound</span> of a gunshot in front of their house, directly below
their bedroom window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She slowly and
cautiously peeped out of their window and saw a person running away from the
place where she heard the explosion come from.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The person jumped over the island in the middle of the street and ran to
the opposite side of the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding the incident, she did not wake up her husband nor did
she call for any help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later,
she heard shouts indicating the discovery of the body of a dead man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She transferred to another window and from
there she saw directly below her window the body of a man lying face up and
holding a piece of wood measuring 24x2x20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> who
was standing over the body took the piece of wood and threw it away.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>When she asked <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> what happened, the latter did not reply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not see Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span>
during or after the incident.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Significant in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>
<span class="SpellE">Serenio</span> was her revelation that on the night before
the fatal shooting of <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span>,</i> <i>their son, and a guest were joined by
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> and Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span>
in a drinking session.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the
drinking spree Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> tore off and threw
away the cigarettes of <span class="SpellE">Serenio's</span> guest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sergio <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span> was
outraged by the affront not only to his guest but also to himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> made a
timely appearance and forcibly dragged her husband away, thus preventing a
violent quarrel between <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> from erupting.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant was charged with Murder for the fatal
shooting of Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The information reads:</p>

<blockquote><i>"That on or about the 29th day of March, 1981 at about
11:30 P.M., in the City of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Philippines and
within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused, armed with a
firearm, with deliberate intent, with intent to kill, with treachery and
evident premeditation, did then and there attack, assault and fire shots upon
one Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> with said firearm hitting him on
his head, thereby inflicting upon him the following physical injuries:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><i>'HEMORRHAGE, INTRACRANIAL, EXTENSIVE, SEVERE SECONDARY TO
GUNSHOT WOUND AT THE HEAD.'<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>as</i></span><i> a
consequence of which said Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> died
instantaneously</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><i>"Contrary to law."</i></span> <span class="GramE">(p. 3, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused, assisted by counsel, pleaded
"not guilty."</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the court found him guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal to this Court, the accused alleges that the trial
court erred:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
finding him guilty of murder;</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
not upholding his defense of alibi; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in not considering the
mitigating circumstance of "intoxication" in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the trial court's finding that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
guilt had been established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was positively identified by the prosecution's
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His own wife (<span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span>) revealed his
possible motive for killing the deceased who had allegedly embarrassed him in
front of his guest by tearing up and destroying the cigarettes offered to him
by said guest during a drinking session in the house of the accused on the
night before he was killed (Decision, p. 43 of Appellant's Brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> defense that he slept
through the shooting which occurred under his bedroom window and that he was
not awakened by the shouts for help, <span class="GramE">nor</span> by the
commotion that followed, is incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Decision, p. 43 of Appellant's Brief.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Treachery was correctly appreciated by the trial court for the
shooting was sudden, unexpected, and done at close-range when the victim had no
expectation whatsoever that he would be attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Valdemora</span>,
102 SCRA 171.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court properly rejected the appellant's alibi that he
was asleep in his room just above the scene of the crime when the shooting
transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An alibi cannot prevail over
the positive identification made by the eyewitnesses, his neighbors Ruben <span class="SpellE">Aranco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gregoria</span> <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>, who knew him well.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His alibi, corroborated only by his wife, is extremely weak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For an alibi to be acceptable, it must count
with strong corroboration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bermoy</span>, 105 SCRA 106.) Considering that the shooting
occurred beside his house, it was entirely possible for the accused to have
gone down from his house to shoot the deceased and rush back to his bed
afterwards.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the appellant's contention that, as the
trial court found that he shot Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span>
"in a moment of extreme inebriation," he should have been convicted
of homicide only, NOT murder, with the mitigating circumstance of
"intoxication." <span class="GramE">(p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
Brief.)</span> Having failed to prove that the liquor he drank impaired his
mental faculties and that his drinking was not habitual or subsequent to the
plan to commit the felony, his intoxication was not a mitigating circumstance
in the commission of the crime (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Baduso</span>, 60
SCRA 60; People vs. Noble, 77 Phil. 93.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the trial court convicting the
appellant, Sergio <span class="SpellE">Serenio</span>, is affirmed, except the
award of civil indemnity to the heirs of the deceased Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Jacalan</span> which is hereby increased to P30<span class="GramE">,000</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the
accused-appellant.</span></p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
