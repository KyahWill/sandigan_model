<p class="BODY">The facts as gleaned from the records are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Caca</span>, driver<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of Fortune Tobacco Corporation and principal
witness for the prosecution, testified that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On September 6, 1979, at about 10:00 <span style="">in the evening, the victim, Miguel 'Mike' Chua, salesman of the Fortune
Tobacco Corporation, was driving a panel truck, together with him, helper <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniar</span> and friend Frank <span class="SpellE">Morante</span>, passing along kilometer 36, <span class="SpellE">southroad</span>,
a zigzag road inside the </span><span class="SpellE">Iwahig</span> Penal Colony,
on their way to Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group had come from Brooke's Point, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place> where they delivered cigarettes and
collected payments for previous sales amounting to more or less P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a
distance of five <span style="">(5) </span>meters,
from the approaching truck, appellant Dante <span class="SpellE">Bartulay</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span>,
co-accused, motioned <span style="">to </span>Mike
Chua to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the truck stopped at
the middle of the road, co-accused <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> approached
the victim at the pretext of borrowing a screw <span style="">driver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim </span>told <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> to wait as he will park the <span style="">truck on </span>the side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this point, appellant and <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> pulled out
their guns and announced a holdup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
ordered the four persons to alight from the truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Beran</span> directed him,
<span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Aniar</span> and Frank <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> to stay at the right side of the road some five (5)
meters away from the truck while appellant separately led the victim about two
meters away from them on the same side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four of them were ordered to lie down
facing the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant with one <span class="GramE">foot,</span> stepped on the shoulder of <span style="">the victim while pointing a gun at him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Beran</span> then divested him and Frank <span class="SpellE">Morante</span> of their watches and wallets while appellant took
Chua's watch and wallet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant asked
the victim where his collection was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
latter told appellant that the money is placed at the back of the driver's
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then ordered <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> to get the money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter did and gave the money contained in a paper bag to
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> demanded the keys of the truck from the victim, who
gave them to appellant, </span>who in turn gave them to <span class="SpellE">Beran</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Beran</span> then ordered
the com<span style="">p</span>anions of the victim to
go inside the panel truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some twenty
five (25) seconds after they were locked up inside <span style="">the </span>truck, two successive shots were fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truck then started to move and while in
motion, he opened the secret exit door of the panel and was able to jump out,
rolling on the ground until he reached the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was able to hitch a ride up to <span class="SpellE">Narra</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>
where he reported the incident to the police authorities (Hearing of Sept. 13,
1985; TSN, pp. 5-20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next day, <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1979</st1:date>, the cadaver of
Miguel Chua was examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Ynzon</span>, the City Health Officer of <st1:place><st1:placename>Puerto</st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">M/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Enriquez, head of the

presence of one "Boy <span class="SpellE">Bungal</span>" at the scene
of the crime as he even borrowed some tools from him that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After ascertaining that "Boy <span class="SpellE">Bungal</span>" was <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Beran</span></span><span style="">, police authorities traced his whereabouts

</span>Recovered from </span>him <span style="">was </span><span style="">P4,500.00

the revolver he used during the holdup, the motorcycle owned by <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span>, which was used as a getaway vehicle, and some
part of the share of appellant from the loot entrusted by him to his brother <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartulay</span> who, upon
investigation by the police, voluntarily informed them of the place where it
was hidden (Exhibits "I" - "N", <u>Ibid</u>.; TSN, pp.

<p class="BODY">At the trial, appellant admitted that he and <span class="SpellE">Beran</span>
only agreed to stage a holdup.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
portrayed himself as the one who guarded the companions of Miguel Chua and that
he was instructed by <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> to get the money from
behind the driver's seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that
upon finding the bag containing the money, he heard two successive shots; he
even resented why <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span>
had to kill Miguel Chua as they merely planned to rob him; he was responsible
in saving the lives of the three passengers by pleading to <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Beran</span> to spare them (TSN, pp. 178-184, Hearing of
Oct. 29, 1987)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered its decision convicting appellant of the crime of
robbery with homicide, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court find (sic) and so founds (sic) Dante <span class="SpellE">Bartulay</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Robbery with Homicide defined and penalized under Article 294 (1) of the
Revised Penal Code, as principal by direct participation, hereby sentences him
to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, with all accessories provided for
by law, to indemnify the heirs of Miguel Chua the amount of Seven Hundred
Twenty Thousand (P720,000.00) Pesos for the expected earnings, Ten Thousand
(P10,000.00) Pesos for moral damages and Ten Thousand (P10,000.00) Pesos for
exemplary damages and to pay the costs." <span class="GramE">(p. 55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In seeking the reversal of his conviction, appellant claims that
the trial court erred:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) in its
findings that he was the one who shot Miguel Chua; (2) in finding him guilty of
the complex crime of robbery with homicide despite lack of evidence; and (3) in
failing to appreciate that <span style="">he </span>endeavored
and in fact was successful in preventing <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> from killing the three companions of Miguel
Chua.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant admits participation in
the commission of robbery but vehemently and specifically denies any
participation in the killing of Miguel Chua (pp. 63-64, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence indubitably shows that appellant and co-accused <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> agreed to commit robbery at Km. 36, <span class="SpellE">Zigzad</span> Road, <span class="SpellE">Iwahig</span> Penal Colony,
Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City, two (2) weeks prior to the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 6, 1979, both
appellant and <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> succeeded in robbing Miguel Chua
of P87,000.00 and the victim was shot to death <span style="">25 </span>seconds subsequent to his three companions’ entry into the <span style="">van.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was no eyew</span>itness to the killing of the said victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was there a showing that appellant
endeavored to prevent the killing of Chua.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A conspiracy in the statutory language exists <span style="">when two </span>or more <span style="">persons </span>avow
to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit it
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Taaca</span>, G.R. No. 35652, September 29, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant tries to exculpate himself of criminal liability by
pointing to co-accused <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> as the one who fired the
shots and killed Chua.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
conspiracy to commit the crime of robbery was conclusively shown <span style="">by </span>the concerted acts of the accused
and homicide was committed as a consequence thereof, all those who participated
are liable as principals in the robbery with homicide, although they did not
actually take part in the homicide, unless it appears that they attempted to
prevent the killing. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><u>The</u> <u>question</u>
<u>as</u> <u>to</u> <u>who</u> <u>actually</u> <u>robbed</u> <u>or</u> <u>who</u>
<u>actually</u> <u>killed</u> <u>is</u> <u>of</u> <u>no</u> <u>moment</u> <u>since</u>
<u>all</u> <u>of</u> <u>them</u> <u>would</u> <u>be</u> <u>held</u> <u>accountable</u>
<u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>crime</u> <u>of</u> <u>robbery</u> <u>with</u> <u>homicide</u>
(People v. Salvador, G.R. No. 77964, July 26, 1988, 163 SCRA 574 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the following actuations of appellant after the shots
were fired clearly show that he is a co-conspirator:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) immediately after the firing of the
shots, he followed the truck driven by <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> in the motorcycle; <span style="">(b </span>when they reached <span class="SpellE">Montible</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> abandoned the
truck, rode in the motorcycle with appellant and proceeded to the house of
appellant's brother in Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span> City where
they divided the loot <span style="">(</span>T<span style="">SN, </span>pp. 184, 196-199, Hearing of <span style="">Oct. </span>30, 1987) Where conspiracy has
been established, a showing as to who inflicted the fatal blow is not
required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v.
Alvarez, G.R. No. 70446, January 31, 1989, 169 SCRA 730).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, appellant
admitted that when he heard the news that he was being hunted by police </span>authorities
in connection with the crime, he immediately bought a plane ticket at the PAL
office in <st1:place><st1:placename>Puerto</st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Princesa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and <span style="">took </span>the second flight to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His sudden departure is indicative of g<span style="">uilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
guilty flee when no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span> but the innocent are
as bold as a lion (People v. Espinosa, G.R. No. 72883, December 20, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly found by the trial court, the use of motor vehicle
by the appellant and his co-conspirator aggravated the commission of the
offense since the vehicle was used to facilitate their escape from the scene of
the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty of robbery with homicide prescribed in Article 294 of
the Revised Penal Code is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
to death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since only one aggravating
circumstance attended the commission of the offense, the greater penalty that
is death shall be applied pursuant to Article 63 of the Revised Penal
Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this penalty cannot be
imposed presently in view of the 1987 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> was correctly imposed by the trial court
upon the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly convicted accused <span style="">of </span>robbery with homicide only despite
the fact that the amended information charged all the four accused namely, <span class="SpellE">Rosalio</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguardia</span>, <span style="">Dante </span><span class="SpellE">Bartulay</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Beran</span> of the
crime of illegal possession of firearm with robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The information alleges that the four accused
by conspiring and confederating together, unlawfully have in their possession
one .380 cal. automatic pistol and one 22 cal. revolver with Serial No. 64618
without the necessary license or permit from the proper authorities and that
while in the possession of said firearms, the four accused, by conspiring
together, committed robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">The information herein is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
Section 13 Rule 110 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure which states that a
complaint or information must charge but one offense except in certain
cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The four accused are charged with
two separate offenses of illegal possession of firearms and robbery with
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When each one of two offenses
committed is punishable by two different laws, they cannot be charged <span class="GramE">in one information</span> as a complex crime but must be regarded
as two separate and distinct offenses, each one to be the subject of separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
duplicity of offenses exists in <span class="GramE">an information</span> the
accused must present his objection by filing a motion to quash the information
on the ground of duplicity of offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the accused fails to object and goes to trial under the information
which contains a description of more than one offense, the general rule is he
thereby waives the objection and may be found guilty of and should be sentenced
for, as many offenses as are charged in the information and proved during trial
(People v. Medina 59 Phil. 134; People v. <span class="SpellE">Miana</span> 50
Phil. 771).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This rule however shall

cannot be convicted of the offenses with respect to which he was not properly
arraigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the accused was not formally arraigned as to
the offense of illegal possession of firearm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The information wrongly <span class="SpellE">complexed</span>
the robbery with homicide with the special offense of illegal possession of
firearm.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the accused
is charged with two distinct offenses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He should therefore be arraigned and required to plead to the two
offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records show that during the
arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty to robbery and not guilty to
homicide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the trial court entered
a conditional plea of not guilty for him to the offense of robbery with
homicide, without requiring the accused to enter his plea to the illegal
possession of firearms (p. 28, Records).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in the rendition of judgment, the trial court convicted him only of
robbery with homicide as there was no proper arraignment of the accused
concerning the other offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one
case, this Court held that where the defendant is charged with three separate
offenses, and he pleaded guilty to the two offenses without pleading to the
third offense charged, the court cannot render judgment of conviction on the
third offense without requiring him to plead (US v. <span class="SpellE">Sobrevinas</span>
35 Phil 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is based on the
principle that a defendant is legally placed on trial only when issue upon the
information which charges such an offense has been joined after arraignment by
his plea of not guilty thereto (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ylagan</span> 58
Phil. 851).</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall sustain the monetary award, consisting of loss of
earnings, made by the trial court in favor of the heirs of the victim as this
matter was not raised in issue in this appeal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Further, this Court grants the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
as death indemnity to be paid by the appellant to the heirs of the victim, in
accordance with the new policy of this Court laid clown in the Resolution of
this Court <u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> </span>dated August 30, 1990 and in People
v. Daniel <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, G.R. 86455, September 14, 1990, in
addition to the moral and exemplary damages awarded by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, except for the above mentioned modification,
the decision appealed from convicting the accused appellant of the crime of
robbery with homicide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> with all the accessories provided for

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">NARVASA, <i style=""><span style="">J</span></i><span style="">.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I agree entirely with the findings and basic conclusions of the <i style="">ponencia</i><span style=""> </span>of Mr. Justice Medialdea.  I write this separate opinion merely with reference to the disquisition
therein (actually <i style="">obiter dictum</i><span style=""> </span>since it has no bearing on the
affirmance, with modification, of the petitioner's conviction) relative to the
duplicitous character of the information filed by the fiscal against the
appellant, which charged him not only with robbery with homicide -- for which
he was properly convicted by the Trial Court -- ­but also with illegal
possession of firearm.  I want to
prevent the discussion on the point from engendering the belief that this Court
is here laying down the proposition that where an indictment is indeed
duplicitous because charging more than one crime, it is the Trial Court's
affirmative obligation to inform the accused of this defect and require him to
plead separately to each of said offenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions of the Rules of Court in force at the time
material to this inquiry<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
required that an accused must be arraigned before the court where the complaint
or information has been filed or assigned for trial (unless the cause shall
have been transferred elsewhere for trial).  The arraignment is made in open court by the judge <span style="">or </span>clerk by ?</p>

<p class="NUM">1.  reading the complaint
or information to the defendant,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">2.  delivering to him a
copy thereof, including a list of witnesses, and</p>

<p class="NUM">3.  asking him whether he
pleads guilty or not guilty as charged.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the arraignment, the accused must be personally present if the
charge is for an offense within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
(now Regional Trial Court) <span style="">and </span>if
for a light offense triable by the justice of the peace or any other inferior
courts of similar jurisdiction, he may appear by attorney.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, at any time before being arraigned, or entering his plea on
arraignment, the accused may move to quash the complaint or information on any
of s<span style="">everal </span>specified grounds,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
one of which is, "That more than one offense is charged except in those
cases in which existing <span style="">laws prescribe
a single punishment for various offenses."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">If
the accused does not move to quash on this ground, he shall be deemed to have
waived it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the Court's duty to assure that the accused is fully
informed of the charges against him.  This is why the information is read to him, and he is also given a copy
of the complaint or information.  His
knowledge of all the facts set out in the indictment, as well as of the
circumstance that those facts constitute several offenses, is thus made
reasonably certain, specially since the law requires <span style="">that </span>he be assisted by counsel on arraignment.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
No obligation is expressly or implicitly imposed on the judge to point out the
duplicitousness (or other defect) of an indictment on which an accused is being
arraigned.  In truth, that function
appears to be ruled out as far as the judge is concerned since it is on the
accused that the law reposes the obligation to move<span style=""> </span>to quash on the ground of duplicity (or otherwise), under
sanction of waiver and loss of said ground of objection.</p>

<p class="BODY">These principles should not be deemed to have been altered by the
Court's Decision in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there are positive indications that the
accused did not completely understand the charges against him; and these
justified a finding that his arraignment was not adequate.  When arraigned, "the accused pleaded
guilty to robbery and not guilty to homicide," as the decision states; but
he made no reference whatever to the offense of illegal possession of firearm,
also set out in the information.  It
thus appears that the accused understood that he was being accused only of
robbery and homicide, and had no inkling that another offense was being
ascribed to him, too.  These
circumstances, in the <i style="">ponente's</i><span style=""> </span>view, warranted a conclusion similar
to that reached in the early case of <i style="">U.S.
v. Sobreviñas</i><span style="">, </span>35 Phil. 32,
where the proceedings were declared by this Court to be fatally defective and
irregular upon the following facts set out in the syllabus, <i style="">viz</i><span style="">.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The accused, while on the witness stand testifying in his own
behalf, <span style="">broke </span>down and admitted
his guilt of the offense with which he was charged in the information upon
which he had been brought to trial (Case No. 1290).  At the same time he admitted his guilt of ** (two) offenses
charged in ** (another information [Case No. 1290]) upon which, however, he had
not been brought to trial.  The trial
court entered judgments convicting<span style=""> </span>and
sentencing the accused of the offenses charged in each of these informations,
without further proceedings, without bringing the accused to trial, without
formal arraignment and without giving the accused an opportunity to enter any
of the pleas authorized in General Orders No. <span style="">58."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0.15in;"><span style="">Upon said facts, this Court disposed as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The judgments entered in the court below convicting and
sentencing the defendant and appellant in the cases now under consideration,
Nos. 11544 and 11545 of the general register of this court, should, for the
reasons stated, be reversed, with the costs in both instances <i style="">de</i><span style="">
</span><i style="">officio</i><span style="">, </span>and the records should be remanded to the court wherein they
originated, reserving to the officers of that court the right to bring these
cases on again for trial or to dismiss the informations as in their discretion
the interests of justice may require.  So ordered."</blockquote>

The 1985 and 1988 amendments have not substantially altered the relevant
provisions governing arraignment and motions to quash.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Rule 116, Sec. 1.   As amended, the
reading is required to be “in the language or dialect known to him”</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Rule 116, Sec. 2.  As amended, the rule
now requires the accused to "be present and personally enter his
plea," without distinction as to the Court before which he is arraigned,
and that if "the accused refuses to plead, or makes a conditonal plea of
guilty, a plea of not guilty shall be entered for him."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Rule 117, Sec. 1.  Originally, the rule
was somewhat awkwardly stated as follows:   "Upon being arraigned the defendant shall immediately, unless
the court grants him further time, either move to quash the complaint or
information or plead thereto, or do both.  If he moves to quash without pleading, and the motion is withdrawn or
overruled, he shall immediately plead." As amended, the rule now simply states
that the motion to quash may be filed by an accused "at any time before
entering his plea."</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
<i>Id</i>., Sec. 2 (e).   The grounds for
quashal have not been altered.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Rule 117, Sec. 10.  In truth, the rule
is that by failing to move to quash at all, he shall be deemed to have waived
all grounds for quashal subject to specified exceptions.</p>





<p class="FOOTNOTES"><a style="" href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
