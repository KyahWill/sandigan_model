prosecution has failed to overcome the constitutional presumption of

<p class="BODY">The accused was a 35-year old man with a wife and four children
at the time of the alleged offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

on the basis of the testimony of the prosecution witnesses, the crime was
committed on October 29, 1982, at about ten o'clock in the evening, in a wooded
area in <span class="SpellE">Pagudpud</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span>
Norte.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Damo</span> went to the
house of <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> to consult him about her cough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> is <span class="GramE">a</span> herb doctor or "<span class="SpellE">arbularyo</span>."
According to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>, the accused asked her to come
back with a maiden 18 years or older to pick the needed herbs with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, she went back to <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span>
house on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1982</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, bringing <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> with her.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> began treating his patient by
pressing a glass of water on her breasts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This treatment continued for some time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Later in the evening, <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> to go with him so they could pick the herbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stressed that it was necessary to do this
at that time as otherwise the herbs would have no healing power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presence of <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
was also indispensable, for the same reason.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> said she hesitated because of
the late hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, she finally
consented, to accommodate her ailing sister-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She even donned a skirt because the accused
had asked her not to wear pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
walking for some three kilometers, she and the accused stopped at a spot near
the seashore where there were many trees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There she started to pick some herbs as indicated by <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While she was doing so, <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> suddenly
grabbed her arm and warned her not to cry out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sensing his intentions, she remonstrated and said, "Do not do this
to me, <span class="SpellE">Manong</span>." He pointed a knife at her neck
to stop her resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not satisfied
with the threat, he boxed her in the abdomen and rendered her unconscious.</p>

<p class="BODY">When she recovered, she found she had been deflowered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She still ached from the blow to her
stomach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her exposed vagina was painful
and a warm fluid was oozing from it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> was standing before her, also naked from the waist
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He handed her <span class="SpellE">her</span>
panty which she put on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They then
started to walk back to his house.</p>

<p class="BODY">She was crying all the way but stopped when they reached his
residence because he had threatened to kill her if she said anything about her
rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She proceeded upstairs and stayed
near the place where <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span> wife and children were
sleeping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was restless the whole
night.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant declared that she left early the following
morning, and in <span class="GramE">the</span> afternoon of the same day, told
her brother about her rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
underwent two medical examinations, first on <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1982</st1:date>, and the second on <st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The report thereon, issued on <st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="11">November
 15, 1982</st1:date>, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>General Condition -
Patient is about 4'10" in height with a very good built.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is shy and hardly <span class="GramE">speak</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Damo</span>
corroborated <span class="SpellE">Arcelie's</span> testimony up to the point
where she left with the accused to pick the medicinal herbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also testified on the girl's conduct upon
her return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness added that the
accused admitted to her in the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1982</st1:date>, after <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
had left, that he had raped the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court noted in its decision that after the filing of
the information against the accused, his father, <span class="SpellE">Fernandico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>, approached the complainant's family for a
possible settlement out of court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he
was rebuffed by <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in"><span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span>
defense was that he and <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> were in fact
lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although this explanation is
often enough rejected by the Court, there are some circumstances in this case
that give it some credence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> testified that he met <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> sometime in 1979 and courted her for two years
until she accepted his love on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="12">December
 13, 1981</st1:date>, when he gave a birthday party at the beach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They exchanged rings in token of their
troth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(He submitted in evidence the one
he says <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> gave him.)<a style="mso-footnote-id:

On <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1982</st1:date>, when
his wife and children were away, <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> stayed with
him in his house all night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had sex
twice, once before they slept and once again at dawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused stated that he did not rape <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1982</st1:date>, and
that they did not even have voluntary sexual intercourse then.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> wanted it,
but he claimed he was ailing with influenza at the time and had gone out only
because he had to pick the herbs for <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
had come along but not because he had asked her; in fact, she had insisted on
accompanying him against his will.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> denies this, <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> said that the two of them were together at a benefit
dance on <st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1982</st1:date>,
the night following the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
even bought then her "social box" for P100.00 for the privilege of
dancing with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was while they were
dancing that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> slapped him and accused him of
lying to her about his wife and children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> said that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
warned him then that she would file a case against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fernando <span class="SpellE">Pia</span> testified for his "<span class="SpellE">barkada</span>," as he described <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He confirmed the story of <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span>
birthday party at the beach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
particularly remembered the night of <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="10">October
 10, 1982</st1:date>, when he visited <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> in his
house to borrow money and came upon his friend in bed with <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also said that in the evening of <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="10">October 29, 1982</st1:date>, he was in <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span> house and saw <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
follow the accused when he went out to get the herbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon her return, <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
joined them in singing and appeared to be in good spirits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following morning, he and <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> went out to pick some orchids and later had
breakfast in <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span> house.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the Court finds especially intriguing - and revealing - is
the testimony of Dr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Balbag</span>, who conducted
the medical examination of <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> and rendered the
report thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find the following
disturbing exchange in the transcript of his testimony:</p>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doctor,
in your medico-legal certificate marked Exhibit C, there is an entry here which
says "laceration at six o'clock and twelve o'clock with rounded <span class="SpellE">coaptible</span> border," could you tell us what this means?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>May I see it your Honor.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As I read x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> I compared x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> I noticed there are some erasures that I found at the
part of the hymen healed laceration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
word "healed" was erased on that, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you have the duplicate copy?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
now you would want to say there is a word "healed"?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
wish to inform the court that excited me; that could be tampered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
will show you again Exhibit C, will you find out if there is the erasure?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is something applied in this part, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
did not erase that before you signed it, Doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, your Honor.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is the duplicate of the one I issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
you want to impress the court that regarding Exhibit C it should be healed
laceration?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
should be healed laceration, your Honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As for the length of the healing period, the doctor testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
did you examine the patient?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>October
31, 1982, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
was the nature of the wound, the laceration wound at six o'clock and twelve
o'clock according to you at the time you examined the patient?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is healed laceration, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Freshly
healed?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Newly healed.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
your opinion, when were those lacerations inflicted?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
can be one or two weeks before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I can't
say, <span class="GramE">your</span> Honor, one or two weeks before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Any more questions,
Fiscal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FISCAL ALEJANDRO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said, Doctor, that the laceration of the hymen was newly healed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Could it be two days before when you examined
that woman?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That would be very hard because two days
that would be fresh laceration.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Normally,
the laceration of the hymen, what is the healing period?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five</span> days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It depends from the environment of the wound,
your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
after five days the laceration is healed?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is my opinion, your Honor.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you say as newly healed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your Honor, but the wound could not heal within two days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot completely heal within two
days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That would be very hard because if
it is inflicted within two days, it would be mere fresh laceration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Continue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FISCAL ALEJANDRO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said, <span class="GramE">Doctor, that</span> the healing period of the
laceration of the hymen may differ on some factors?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Would
it be possible by the natural power of the victim could cause the healing of
the wound inflicted?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What</span> do you mean by "natural
power"?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
your own human capacity, would the healing be possible cause immediate healing
of the wound?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
my opinion, a wound inflicted two days will not heal immediately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, Doctor, is it not a fact that you also requested the victim to come
to your office x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> I
withdraw the question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is all, your
Honor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that although <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
said she was examined twice, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Balbag</span> said the
second one was more of a mental examination.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The medical examination itself was concluded on October 31, 1982.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge dismissed the matter of the ruptured hymen and
noted that virginity is not an essential element of the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Citing jurisprudence, he said even
prostitutes could be raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is true
enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But what he failed to consider
is that the physical evidence of the <u>healed</u> laceration reflected on <span class="SpellE">Arcelie's</span> credibility, especially in her narration of her
claimed violation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Asked if she had had any previous sexual experience, she said <u>none</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
That would mean she was deflowered on October 29, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was only two days before her medical
examination, which revealed that the laceration of her hymen had already
healed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her recuperation was truly
amazing if wonders are to be believed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of this undeniable physical evidence of the
miraculously healed maidenhead, the Court is more inclined to accept <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span> testimony that he and <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
were lovers and had sex twice on October 10, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her hymen must have been ruptured <span class="GramE">then,</span> or perhaps later, but not as late as October 29, 1982,
when she claims <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> forced himself upon her.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, it is not even certain that she had sexual intercourse
that night, as there was no showing of this in the medical report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No trace of spermatozoa was found in her
vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The panty and skirt she wore,
both of which she said she used for wiping the red and white fluid oozing from
her groin,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
were not presented at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that there are flaws in the evidence of the defense
that invite disbelief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> clearly proclaimed himself a liar when he confessed
his deception in concealing from <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> the fact
that he had a wife and children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
there is no corroboration of his testimony that he and <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
were together at a benefit dance the night after the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The slapping incident he narrated could
surely have been witnessed by many persons who were at that social gathering,
but none of them came forward at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for <span class="SpellE">Pia</span>, the impression of the Court
is that he was testifying more out of loyalty for his friend than in the
interest of truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not easy to
accept, for example, that although he said he had gone several times to <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span> house to borrow money, the only date he could
remember having done so, conveniently enough, was October 10, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other dates are a blur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, interestingly, although he claimed the
accused was a close friend of his and lived only twenty meters away from his
own house, this witness did not know that <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> was
married and had four children.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But in a criminal action, the conviction of the accused depends
not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Even if it be supposed that the defense in the case at bar is weak, the
prosecution, as it happens, is even weaker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Office of the Solicitor General seems to think so too, if the
half-hearted <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief it submitted is any
indication.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds it hard to accept that a young maiden like <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> would go out late at night with a man she had met
only six hours before to a wooded and secluded place where her only possible
protection against his temptation would be his own forbearance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unsophisticated girls may be naive to a
certain degree but they cannot be that trusting.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> says she hesitated when <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> asked her to come with him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she changed her mind later for the
benefit of her sister-in-law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> seems also to have completely trusted <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> even if she herself had met him only once before, on
October 18, 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is also curious
that she did not even inquire why, as she said she noticed, <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
was silent and apparently under stress when she returned from her nocturnal
trip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness was apparently not
much interested either when <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> left her early
the next morning without any explanation, <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span>
did not bother to ask.</p>

<p class="BODY">The strangest piece in this puzzle is <span class="SpellE">Tagle's</span>
nameless wife and children who were either conveniently absent or unobtrusive
even when present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>
says they were in <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
when he gave his birthday party at the beach and won <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
and on October 10, 1982, when <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> slept with him
in his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But October 29, 1982, was
different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wife was there but did
not object when <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
went out into the night together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was not heard to say anything either when the two returned hours later from
whatever they might have been doing in the dark.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She accepted <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
back into her house and even slept in the same place with her, presumably with
complete peace of mind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was not
one ounce of jealousy in her.</p>

<p class="BODY">But that is another story.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before us, we feel that the prosecution has failed to
establish the necessary quantum of evidence to justify the conviction of the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the Court regards as especially
significant the physical evidence of the healed hymen, which suggests that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> was not telling the truth about her alleged
violation on the night in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
innocence was ruptured, but not on that night of October 29, 1982.</p>

<p class="BODY">It looks to us that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span> has acted
out of spite over her discovery that she had been deceived by her married lover
and she is now using this case to wreak her vengeance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Our finding is that <span class="SpellE">Arcelie</span>
was not a violated virgin but a betrayed and resentful sweetheart bent on the
revenge of a woman scorned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let it not be supposed from this decision that the constitutional
presumption of innocence commands the exoneration of the guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption is certainly not conclusive
and may yield to positive proof that the crime has been committed by the
prisoner on the dock as charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
that proof, if it is to prevail, must be strong enough to dispel all doubt and
sustain the defendant's conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is absolutely indispensable that it be convincing enough to warrant his
punishment, not the least of which, along with the loss of his liberty or
property, is the stain upon his honor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is REVERSED and the
accused-appellant is ACQUITTED. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It is so
ordered.</p>
