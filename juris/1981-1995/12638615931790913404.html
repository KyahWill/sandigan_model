of Court seeking the annulment of the resolution of the respondent National
Labor Relations Commission dated <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">March
 12, 1987</st1:date> (p. 28, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) in NLRC
Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-8-3808-83, entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>, Complainant, versus Manila Electric
Company, Respondents", affirming the decision of the Labor Arbiter which
ordered the reinstatement of private respondent herein, <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Signo</span>, to his former position without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> was employed
in <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> as supervisor-<span class="SpellE">leadman</span> since January<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">
</span>1963 up to the time when his services were terminated on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="5">May 18<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">, </span>1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1981, a certain Fernando de Lara filed an application with the
petitioner company for electrical services at his residence at <span class="SpellE">Peñafrancia</span> Subdivision, <st1:street><st1:address>Marcos
  Highway</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>
facilitated the processing of the said application as well as the required
documentation for said application at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rizal</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>In
consideration thereof, private respondent received from Fernando de Lara the
amount of P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Signo</span> thereafter filed the application for
electric services with the Power Sales Division of the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was established that the area where the residence of de Lara
was located is not yet within the serviceable point of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>,
because the <span class="GramE">place</span> was beyond the 30-meter distance
from the nearest existing <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to expedite the electrical
connections at de Lara's residence, certain employees of the company, including
respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>, made it appear in the application
that the sari-sari store at the corner of Marcos Highway, an entrance to the
subdivision, is applicant de Lara's establishment, which, in reality is not
owned by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of this scheme, the electrical connections to de
Lara's residence were installed and made possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, due to the fault of the Power Sales
Division of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>, Fernando de Lara was
not billed for more than a year.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="GramE">company</span> conducted an
investigation of the matter and found respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>
responsible for the said irregularities in the installation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the services of the latter were
terminated on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1983</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal, unpaid wages, and separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had submitted their position papers, the Labor
Arbiter rendered a decision (p. 79, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>) on <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1985</st1:date>, which stated, <u>inter</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>"Verily, complainant's act of inducing the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>
employees to effectuate the installation on <span class="SpellE">Engr</span>. de
Lara's residence prejudiced the respondent, and therefore, complainant himself
had indeed became a participant in the transactions, although not directly,
which turned out to be illegal, not to mention that some of the materials used
therein belongs to <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span>, some of which were
inferior quality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While complainant may deny the violation, he cannot do away
with company's Code on Employee Discipline, more particularly Section 7, par. 8
and Section 6, par. 24 thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
as admitted by the respondent, the infraction of the above cited Code is
punishable by reprimand to dismissal."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">x <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And in this case,
while considering that complainant indeed committed the above-cited infractions
of company Code of Employee Discipline, We shall also consider his records of
uninterrupted twenty (20) years of service coupled with two (2) commendations
for honesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, <span class="GramE">We</span> shall take note that subject offense is his first, and
therefore, to impose the extreme penalty of dismissal is certainty too
drastic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A penalty short of dismissal is
more in keeping with justice, and adherence to compassionate society.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, respondent <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> is
hereby directed to reinstate complainant <span class="SpellE">Apolinario</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> to his former position as Supervisor <span class="SpellE">Leadman</span> without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
considering that he is not at all faultless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is however, here warned, that commission of similar offense in the
future, shall be dealt with more severely.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed from the decision to the respondent
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1987</st1:date>, the respondent Commission
dismissed both appeals for lack of merit and affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">toto</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>the decision of the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1987</st1:date>,
the instant petition was filed with the petitioner contending that the
respondent Commission committed grave abuse of discretion in affirming the
decision of the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
temporary restraining order was issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1987</st1:date>, enjoining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the </span>respondents from enforcing the questioned resolution of the
respondent Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to resolve in the instant case is whether or not
respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> should be dismissed from <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span> on grounds of serious misconduct and loss
of trust and confidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>
violated Sections 6 and 7 of the company's Code on Employee Discipline, which
provide:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 6, Par. 24 - Encouraging, inducing or threatening
another employee to perform an act constituting a violation of this Code or of
company work, rules or an offense in connection with the official duties of the
latter, or allowing himself to be persuaded, induced or influenced to commit
such offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Penalty – Reprimand to dismissal, depending upon the gravity
of the offense.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 7, Par. 8 - Soliciting or receiving
money, gift, share, percentage or benefits from any person, personally or
through the mediation of another, to perform an act prejudicial to the Company.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Penalty - Dismissal." (pp. 13-14, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner further argues that the acts
of private respondent constituted breach of trust and caused the petitioner
company economic losses resulting from the unbilled electric consumption of de
Lara; that in view thereof, the dismissal of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> is proper considering the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The power to dismiss is the normal prerogative of the
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employer, generally, can
dismiss or lay-off an employee for just and authorized causes enumerated under
Articles 282 and 283 of the Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
the right of an employer to freely discharge his employees is subject to
regulation by the State, basically in the exercise of its paramount police
power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the
preservation of the lives of the citizens is basic duty of the State, more
vital than the preservation of corporate profits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Euro-<span class="SpellE">Linea</span>, <span class="SpellE">Phils</span>. Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 75782, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1987</st1:date>, 156 SCRA 78).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that herein respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span>
is guilty of breach of trust and violation of company rules, the penalty for
which ranges from reprimand to dismissal depending on the gravity of the
offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as earlier stated, the
respondent Commission and the Labor Arbiter found that dismissal should not be
meted to respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> considering his twenty (20)
years of service in the employ of petitioner, without any previous derogatory
record, in addition to the fact that <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>
had awarded him in the past, two (2) commendations for honesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If ever the petitioner suffered losses
resulting from the unlisted electric consumption of de Lara, this was found to
be the fault of petitioner's Power Sales Division.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reason to disturb these findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-established is the principle that
findings of administrative agencies which have acquired expertise because their
jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only
respect but even finality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judicial
review by this Court on labor cases does not go so far as to evaluate the sufficiency
of the evidence upon which the proper labor officer or office based his or its
determination but is limited to issues of jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion (Special Events and Central Shipping Office Workers Union v. San
Miguel Corporation, G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">L-51002-06, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="5"><span class="GramE">May 30, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 122 SCRA 557).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has held time and again, in a number of decisions,
that notwithstanding the existence of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">valid
</span>cause for dismissal, such as breach of trust by an employee,
nevertheless, dismissal should not be imposed, as it is too severe a penalty if
the latter has been employed for a considerable length of time in the service
of his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span> Mines, Inc. v. NLRC, et al., G.R.

<p class="BODY">In a similar case, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"As repeatedly been held by this Court, an employer cannot
legally be compelled to continue with the employment of a person who admittedly
was guilty of breach of trust towards his employer and whose continuance in the
service of the latter is patently inimical to its interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law in protecting the rights of the <span class="GramE">laborers,</span> authorized neither oppression nor self-destruction
of the employer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, taking into account private respondent's
‘twenty-three (23) years of service which undisputedly is unblemished by any
previous derogatory record’ as found by the respondent Commission itself, and
since he has been under preventive suspension during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case, in the absence of a showing that the continued employment of
private respondent would result in petitioner's oppression or self-destruction,
We are of the considered view that his dismissal is a drastic punishment. <span class="GramE">x <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span>
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">x <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span></span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The ends of social and compassionate justice would therefore
be served if private respondent is reinstated but without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
in view of petitioner's obvious good faith.” (<span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span>
Mines, Inc. v. NLRC, et al., 117 SCRA 528)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Further, in carrying out and interpreting the Labor Code's
provisions and its implementing regulations, the workingman's welfare should be
the primordial and paramount consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This kind of interpretation gives meaning and substance to the liberal
and compassionate spirit of the law as provided for in Article 4 of the New
Labor Code which states that "all doubts in the implementation and
interpretation of the provisions of the Labor Code including its implementing
rules and regulations shall be resolved in favor of labor" (<span class="SpellE">Abella</span> v. NLRC, G.R. No. 71812, July 30, 1987, 152 SCRA 140).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, reinstatement of respondent <span class="SpellE">Signo</span> is proper in the instant case, but without the award
of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, considering the good faith of the
employer in dismissing the respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby
