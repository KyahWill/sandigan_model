<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="7">8 July 1985</st1:date>,

Clarification".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The unions informed

companies to be P10,117,016.20) which, according to the unions, may be
distributed, even pending their appeal before the NLRC, as said appeal
allegedly involved only the deduction of P13,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same Motion, the unions prayed for the
issuance of an order directing the immediate distribution of the P8<span class="GramE">,300,000.00</span> (P10,117,016.20) among all the employees<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

</span></span>During one such conference, Labor Arbiter Son proposed the
immediate distribution of the Fund residue by the companies, preferably before
Christmas of 1985, provided the unions would agree to withdraw their appeal
then pending before the NLRC in the matter of the amount deducted from the
Fund.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ford and <span class="SpellE">Ensite</span>
agreed to the proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
unions reserved their final decision on whether or not to agree with the
proposal until they had an exact quantification by the companies of the Fund
residue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, Ford and <span class="SpellE">Ensite</span>, through counsel, disclosed that the Fund residue is
actually P10<span class="GramE">,117,016.20</span>, not P8,300,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">A careful perusal of the foregoing provision shows that the
retirement, death and disability benefits paid under the Plan are deemed
integrated with and in lieu of termination benefits required to be paid under
the Labor Code, which in turn includes instances where the employees are
terminated due to closure of business.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The pertinent provision
of the Labor Code is found in Article 283 which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 283.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Closure of establishment and reduction of

</span>A fraction of at least six (6) months shall be considered one (1) whole

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the deduction of P13<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span>
from the Retirement Fund, utilized for the payment of separation benefits is
well in accord with the "integration provision", and, as such, cannot
be seriously assailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the fact that the "integration provision" was
incorporated in the respective <span class="SpellE">CBAs</span> of the companies

integration of <u>separation benefits</u> with and in lieu of the retirement,
death, and disability benefits under the Plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such being the case, and considering that the Retirement Plan should be
interpreted in its entirety so as to give meaning to all the provisions
therein, the phrase <u>retirement years</u> should not be literally construed
as referring only to cases of employees' retirement from the companies, but
should be broadly interpreted as inclusive of all other instances of employees'
separation from the companies, such as, by reason of death, disability or <u>closure
of business</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Furthermore, the
companies cannot be charged with "diversion of funds" for deducting

supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">It cannot also be said
that, by deducting the separation benefits from the Retirement Fund, the
companies are paying the employees who have earned vested rights under the
plan, with separation benefits out of their own money, and that in effect, a
"recovery" is made by the companies of their contribution to the
Plan.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The Retirement Fund was <u>fully</u>
and <u>solely</u> funded by Ford and <span class="SpellE">Ensite</span>, that is,
without contributions from any of their employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the "vested right" of the

cases </span>of their voluntary resignation from the companies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>it happened, the companies closed down, thereby pre-empting any
voluntary resignation on the part of the employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Still, the employees are paid full separation
benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing, the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter were
justified in sustaining the companies' action in charging the Retirement Fund
for payment of the employees' separation benefits occasioned by the companies'
closure of business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the issue in G.R. No. 75628, Ford and <span class="SpellE">Ensite</span> allege that the Resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="5">20 May 1986</st1:date> granting the unions' Motion for
Execution relative to the non-<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> amount of
P10<span class="GramE">,117,016.20</span> is void, having been allegedly issued
after the NLRC had lost jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The companies contend that the NLRC
Resolution dated 4 February 1986 denying the unions' first motion for
reconsideration, is a final resolution of all the issues in the case, so that
when the unions filed their second urgent motion for reconsideration, dated 13
February 1986, the NLRC could not and should not have legally entertained the
same, because under the Interim Guidelines of the Rules of Court, second
motions for reconsideration of final orders or judgments are not allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of the companies is without merit, because the
Fund residue of P10<span class="GramE">,117,016.20</span> was never the subject
of any motion for reconsideration, much less a second motion for
reconsideration on the part of the unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Manifestation and Motion for Writ of Execution, and the Urgent Motion for

Execution, respectively filed by the unions on 15 November and 9 December 1985,
both before the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the
filing of a second motion for reconsideration is not barred under the Labor Code
or the NLRC Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Administrative and

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The companies'
alternative excuse that it is "actuarially impossible" for them to
compute the individual shares of the employees in the Fund residue, is likewise
untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is because the residue </span>amounting
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to P10<span class="GramE">,117,016.20</span>

employees; their respective </span>service records; and books of accounts in
the possession of the trustee bank (BPI).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in one of their conciliation conferences in 1985,
before Labor Arbiter Son, the companies agreed to the distribution of the Fund residue
if only the unions would withdraw their appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the companies agreed to such a proposal (which however was
eventually rejected by the unions as they would allegedly lose out if their
appeal were abandoned), is also an indication that the computations of the
employees' individual shares in the Fund residue were already prepared and
ready at that time, or that at least the companies were then prepared and
willing to immediately make the desired computations on the basis of the
pertinent documents in their possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the automatic deduction by the companies of 10% of
the Fund residue for attorney's fees of the unions' counsel, based on the
Decision of Labor Arbiter Son, we find no rule of law or tenet of judicial
ethics violated thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the workplaces of the employees have been closed simultaneously with the
companies' closure of business, it would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">be </span>almost impossible for the unions' counsel
to be able to personally collect attorney's fees from his clients who are
presently spread out here and abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being the custodian of the Fund residue duly belonging to the
employees, and from which Fund, the attorney's fees of unions' counsel are to
be <span class="GramE">paid,</span> the companies are in a proper position to
effect the automatic deduction of the attorney's fees of the unions'
counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By doing so, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">companies will not be acting as agents of the
