Incidentally, the records are not clear on why the five additional accused were
included in the amended informations, much less on their supposed complicity in
the incident.  In fact, the sole witness
of the prosecution on this point, Renato Sevilla, testified that on that
occasion he never saw the accused Marcial, Dodie, Romeo, Helen and Melanie
Arriesgado.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General summarizes the factual antecedents of these
cases as perceived by the prosecution, with page references to the transcripts
of the stenographic notes of the trial, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x on March 3, 1988, at about, 5:30 o'clock in the
afternoon, prosecution eyewitness Renato Sevilla, a member of the Integrated
Civilian Home Defense Force (ICHDF) and residing at Old Bago, Asturias, Cebu,
was with his fellow ICHDF members Vivencio Madrid, Venancio Nara and Alejandro
Arias and civilians Wenceslao Ynoy and Madrid's wife Flor(i)sita.  Three of them were armed with firearms.  They were on their way home and while
passing by a river and walking uphill, they were ambushed or gunshots were
fired towards their direction at Barangay Agbanga, Asturias, Cebu.  Venancio Nara was hit immediately by bullets
fired from a (G)arand rifle and fell down the river.  He was hit on the breast and his head was blown off and (he) died
instantaneously.  Alejandro Arias was
also hit by bullets from a (G)arand rifle or rifles on the front and at the
back column of his body and likewise died immediately.  Vivencio Madrid was also hit by bullets and
was brought to a hospital where he expired later.  Wenceslao Ynoy was also hit by bullets on the arms but survived
and went or migrated to Mindanao (pp. 2-4, t.s.n., November 22, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Because Sevilla was already alone and could not fire back, be
had to run away but before doing so he had to first advise and let Flor(i)sita
Madrid run away ahead of him and as he looked back at Flor(i)sita who was
behind him he saw and positively identified appellants Jesus Lagnas, Agustin
Lagnas and Corito Arriesgado from a distance of five (5) meters as among their
ambushers.  He knew appellants for a
long time already because Jesus Lagnas and he are neighbors while Agustin
Lagnas resided in Barangay Baye and Corito Arriesgado lived in the adjacent
Barangay Bairan.  Jesus and Agustin
Lagnas were armed with (G)arand rifles while Corito Arriesgado was armed with a
carbine rifle (sic) (pp. 4-7, t.s.n. November 22, 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following day, or March 4, 1988, Sevilla and his
superior, Lt. Manuel, accompanied by their comrades, proceeded to the scene of
the incident, sought and found appellants at the house of Jesus Lagnas where
they were arrested and later brought to the police station at Lutopan.  The relatives of the victims Venancio Nara,
Alejandro Arias and Vivencio Madrid and of the injured Wenceslao Ynoy were also
informed of what happened to their kins (pp. 8-9, t.s.n. November 22,
1989)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presents the following statement
of facts, likewise with page references to the transcript of stenographic notes,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused are young, carefree, and typical farmhands of the
mountain barangays of Bairan, and Baye, Asturias, Cebu, Philippines.  At the time of their arrest at dawn that
Sunday of 6 March 1988 (Q3, pp. 5, TSN-marilyn t. oliverio, 24 June 1991),
Agustin Lagnas was only seventeen (17) years old, Jesus Lagnas, twenty-three
(23) years old, and Cor(i)to Arriesgado, twenty-six (26) years old.  The first two are brothers while the third
is the brother-in-law, the latter having married the sister of the Lagnas
brothers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As usual for the three (3) accused in their pursuit to earn a
living for their families, accused-appellant, Agustin Lagnas got himself hired
in the farm of Gregoria Limutin Trocio, in Bgy. Bairan, Asturias, Cebu, from 29
February 1988 up to, and including 4 March 1988 (Q4, pp. 3, TSN­-M.D. Destura,
5 August 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From 29 February 1988 to 4 March 1988, Agustin Lagnas was
home in Bgy. Bairan not earlier than 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon (Q5, pp. 4,
TSN-M.D. Destura, 5 August 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused-appellant, Cor(i)to Arriesgado, was contracted by the
Bgy. Councilor of Bgy. Baye, Emiliano Casas, to cut fifty (50) bamboos in the
house of the latter the whole day of 3 March 1988 (Q1, pp. 4, TSN-marilyn t.
olivero, 24 June 1991).  On this day of
3 March 1988, Cor(i)to Arriesgado, was in the house of Casas from 7:00 o'clock
in the morning, and went off only at past 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon (Q6,
pp. 3, TSN­-marilyn t. oliverio, 24 June 1991).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Similarly, Jesus Lagnas was also preoccupied with his
employment in the farm owned by Generoso Sevilla, the whole day of 3 March
1988, from 7:00 o'clock in the morning until 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon (Q3,
pp. 3, TSN-A.A. Delica, 24 April 1991).  This farm is located in Bgy. Baye, Asturias, Cebu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, an ambush killing which resulted in the death of
three (3) ICHDF men, namely:  Vivencio
Madrid, Venancio Nara, and Alejandro Arias, and the wounding of one civilian,
Wenceslao (Y)noy, occurred at Bgy. Agbanga, Asturias, Cebu, at 5:30 o'clock in
the afternoon of 3 March 1988 (Q7, pp. 3, TSN a.g. mansueto, 22 November
1989).  Barangay Agbanga is a two-hour
hilly walk from Bgy. Baye, and about the same hours of travel on foot from Bgy.
Bairan, with no transportation available.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Said ambush involved the lone prosecution witness, Renato
Sevilla, a member of the ICHDF, Vivencio Madrid, Florisita Madrid (wife of
Vivencio), Venancio Nara, Wenceslao (Y)noy, and Alejandro Arias.  Of the six, Renato Sevilla, Florisita Madrid,
and Wenceslao (Y)noy survived the ambush (Q13 &amp; 15, pp. 4, TSN-a.g.
mansueto, 22 November 1989).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On 6 March 1988, at 3:00 o'clock dawn on a Sunday, the three
(3) accused-appellants who passed the night at the house of accused-appellant,
Jesus Lagnas, in Bgy. Baye were arrested on suspicion of complicity in the
ambush?killing."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reposing credence in the submissions of the prosecution, the
court below rendered judgment jointly in the three cases on October 18, 1991,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
disposing in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, this
Court finds accused, Jesus Lagnas, Agustin Lagnas and Corito Arriesgado:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  In Crim. Case No.

<p class="BODY">In a bid to obtain the reversal of the lower court's judgment,
appellants have come to us, faulting the court below with the following
errors:  (1) The lower court erred in
outrightly disregarding accused's defense of alibi and denial; and (2) The
lower court erred in convicting the accused upon the untruthful,
uncorroborated, and therefore incredible testimony of the lone prosecution
witness, where it appears that there are several witnesses to the commission of
the crime of murder.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a cardinal rule in our criminal justice system that to
deprive a person of his precious life or liberty, the evidence against him must
stand the crucible test of reasonable doubt to overthrow the constitutionally
guaranteed presumption of innocence he has in his favor.  This proof beyond reasonable doubt is the
degree of proof that, after investigation of the whole record, produces moral
certainty in an unprejudiced mind of the accused's culpability.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is a rule that the findings of the judge who tried the
case and heard the witnesses are not to be disturbed on appeal, this Court will
not hesitate to take exception to this rule on finality of the trial court's
factual findings if there is a showing that the trial court had overlooked,
misunderstood or misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance
that would have affected the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases at bar, the conviction of herein appellants was
predicated on the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Renato
Sevilla.  We are, therefore, constrained
to put the latter's alleged eyewitness testimony in the lower court under close
scrutiny and meticulous evaluation in order to determine whether or not the
evidence of the prosecution anchored on that sole evidentiary mooring is strong
enough to produce conviction under an impartial assessment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our review and calibration of the testimony of this witness
reveals that he is sorely lacking in that desirable and indispensable
consistency which would inspire belief in his credibility or even in the
accuracy of his vaunted observations both of the details of the incident and
the <u>dramatis</u> <u>personae</u> therein.  We do not agree, as the prosecution expectedly argues, that the
conflicting statements of the witness pointed out by the defense<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
are supposedly only minor or trivial in nature.  On the contrary, we are convinced that the credibility of witness
Sevilla has been seriously eroded and gravely placed in dubiety by his very own
assertions on the witness stand and, as we have discerned, by his obvious
tendency to improvise upon being confronted with his errors and when he could
not credibly gloss over the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, when asked what he did during the attack on his group,
this was what he said:</p>

<blockquote>"Q  What did you do at that time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I ran, Sir, because I
was alone left (sic) and I could not fire back.  I just ran away.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, what did you do
after seeing and looking back (at) the three persons?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I ran away.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Towards where?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I ran towards another
barrio, Banban, sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, however, he admittedly injected a
completely new improvisation to his original story, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the actual shooting when you saw Venancio Nara was hit did you also see
Vivencio Madrid being hit?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, but before he was
hit the other group was hit so we were two who exchanged fires (sic) with the
armed men.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, you said that the two
of you exchanged fires (sic) with the armed men.  Who were these two?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>V(i)vencio Madrid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And who was the second
person who exchanged fires (sic) with the ambushers?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was the one who
exchanged fires (sic) also.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, you are now testifying
that you fired at the ambushers.  Was it
not that you testified before this Honorable court on direct examina­tion that
you were not able to fire your gun because it got stocked-up (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, when I crawled on
the ground my firearm was filled with sand or soil.  That is why it got stocked up (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And when you were asked
on the direct examination nothing was mentioned that you exchanged fires (sic)
with the armed men.  It is only now that
you said that you exchanged fires (sic) with the armed men, is it correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">If it were true that he did fire back at their attackers, he
could not have failed to mention this very significant detail in his sworn
statement which was executed on March 6, 1988, or three days after the ambush.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
It is evident that he was more likely to remember the details of the incident
at the time it happened, and forget them as the years pass by.  In effect, this witness would want us to
subscribe to the idea that he could better remember the details of the event almost
three years later than when the same occurred and the facts were still fresh in
his mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, when he was made to realize that he had made several
contradictory statements in his affidavit vis-a-vis his testimony in open
court, he tried to cover up his tergiversation by blaming the one who prepared
his sworn statement.  In the process,
however, the falsity of his subterfuge was readily exposed.</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x why is it that in your direct examina­tion you said that Agustin Lagnas
(was) armed with a (G)arand, and in your affidavit no. 23 you said that Agustin
Lagnas was armed with a shotgun, why is this so?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The one who prepare(d)
the affidavit perhaps made an error.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now, you signed your
sworn statement which is also marked as Exh. 1-A, and when you signed this
sworn statement, was it not read to you before you signed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, it was not read, I
just signed it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But it was given to you
to be read?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, it (was) just shown
to me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you not insist in
reading it?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You did not also insist
(on) having it read before you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir I (was) just
merely told that this is the affidavit."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately for this witness, he had obviously forgotten that
he had previously given an altogether different story on this score:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
Mr. Sevilla, this sworn statement that you have executed on the 6th day of

hopes of the prosecution's case having been pinned on the credible performance

actually revealed that the truth did not sit on his lips which, instead,
articulated the prevarications so often condemned but just as often perpetrated
in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, when asked to identify the malefactors, which
identification is the testimonial linchpin of a criminal prosecution, Sevilla
this time crowned his nauseating travesty of the judicial process by committing

<p class="BODY">It is true that in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Reception</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
we held that "(i)dentification of a person is not established solely
through knowledge of the name of that person.  Familiarity with the physical features, particularly those of the face,
is actually the best way to identify the person." Never­theless,
considering the factual circumstances of these cases, the aforequoted ruling is
not adverse but even favorable to the prosecution.  Renato Sevilla asserted that he knew the appellants very well, in
fact over a period of years and with proximity in their residences.  It would, therefore, be unimaginable, if not
downright impossible, for him not to have properly identified them.  Moreover, in the rural areas of the
provinces, people tend to be familiar with their neighbors names or identities,
and even the relatives, genealogical lineage and social antecedents of the
latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing demonstrated facts, the consistent
ruling of this Court that where conditions of visibility are favorable and the
witness does not appear to be biased against the man on the dock, his other
assertions as to the identity of the malefactor should normally be accepted,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
is inapplicable to the cases at bar.  Furthermore, witness Sevilla strongly appears to be biased against
appellants considering that the latter rejected his offer to join him in the
Integrated Civilian Home Defense Force (ICHDF).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Contrary to the lower court's observation,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
we find such rejection sufficient to provoke Sevilla to implicate herein
appellants since their refusal of ICHDF membership could have been construed by
him to mean, as he did repeatedly imply,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
that their sympathies were with the Communists whose rebellious activities the
ICHDF was created to suppress.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also cannot but wonder why the two other victims, Wenceslao
Ynoy and Florisita Madrid, were not presented in court.  With regard to the latter, her testimony was
ordered dispensed with when she failed to show up despite several routine
notices.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
We know that it is up for the prosecution to determine who to present as
witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
However, as in the instant case, when the lone prosecution witness committed
inexplicable testimonial lapses which virtually rendered unacceptable any
pretense as to his credibility, the prosecution's passivity is significant and
revealing.  Ynoy and Madrid, both
supposed eyewitnesses to the incident, should necessarily have been presented
to corroborate and bolster Sevilla's testimony and it was definitely within the
capability and power of the State to arrange for or compel their presence in
court.  For, it is the obligation of the
prosecution to prove its allegations, not of the defense to disprove them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, since Florisita Madrid is the wife of the victim, Vivencio Madrid, it
is to be expected that she would normally be interested and more conscientious
in pursuing the case to demand and exact justice from the felons.  The failure on the part of the prosecution
to produce these witnesses under the obtaining circumstances gives rise to the
presumption that, if produced, their testimony would be adverse to the case for
the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it is true that appellants rely heavily on their defense of
alibi.  While alibi is admittedly a weak
defense, this Court, however, does not at once look upon it with disfavor nor
does the Court have a mental prejudice against the accused who use it as their
defense, for the defense of alibi does not relieve the prosecution of the
required quantum of proof.  Further, the
rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven has never been intended to shift
the burden of proof in criminal cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is also the rule that for alibi to prosper, it must be
convincing as to preclude any doubt that the accused could not have been
physically present at the place of the crime or its vicinity at the time of its
commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant cases, we believe that the defense has sufficiently established
that it was physically impossible or, at the least, highly improbable for
appellants to be at the scene of the incident at the time of the ambuscade.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gregoria Limutin Trocio categorically established that appellant
Agustin Lagnas worked for her in her farm at Barangay Bairan up to 4:30 in the
afternoon of March 3, 1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Generoso Sevilla was positive that at 4:30 P.M. on the same date, appellant
Jesus Lagnas was actually still working in his farm at Barangay Baye.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn35" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
As for Corito Arriesgado, he finished cutting bamboos for Emiliano Casas, at
5:00 P.M. at Barangay Baye.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
These witnesses, therefore, proved without contradiction that appellants worked
with them until at least 4:30 P.M. or even later, and that none of them had
left earlier.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same witnesses, including herein appellants, likewise
sufficiently demonstrated that the distance between Barangays Baye and Bairan,
where the later were working, and Barangay Agbanga, where the ambush
transpired, and the nature or condition of the road between these places made
it virtually impossible for appellants to traverse the same and be at Barangay
Agbanga at 5:30 P.M. when the attack happened.  Gregoria Limutin Trocio informed the trial court thereof, in answer to these
questions:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do

<p class="BODY">On his part, Emiliano Casas declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">which appellant Jesus Lagnas corroborated
from the aspect of travel time:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
far is that from Baye?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quite far.  When a person will take a walk, it will

<p class="BODY">Appellant Corito Arriesgado explained the topographical problems
and difficulty of travel between the places involved:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
you know how far is Agbanga to Baye?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quite far, if we have to
walk it could be reach(ed) more or less two (2) hours.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could the place be
negotiated by a vehicle?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If there is no flood the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">and this was confirmed by appellant
Agustin Lagnas without any countervailing reaction from the prosecution:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
far is the place (from) Agbanga to Bairan?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In walking it took two

<blockquote>  Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could it be negotiated by
passenger bus?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is also worth mentioning that the
place where the ambush happened is a mountainous area.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
This and the aforestated facts were never refuted by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, considering the nature of ambuscades, to be able to
participate therein appellants had necessarily to be at the scene of the
incident several minutes before the attack so as to insure its success.  There should be sufficient time for the
attackers, even assuming that there had already been due pre-arrangement, but on
which not even a scintilla of evidence has been adduced, to position themselves
and lie in wait for their prey.  On the
contrary, it was convincingly attested that appellants left their respective
places of work not earlier than 4:30 P.M. of that day.  They, therefore, could not even have reached
the scene of the crime at 5:30 P.M., considering the distance and the nature of
the road to be travelled on, as earlier explained.  It would then be impossible for them to have prepared themselves
in time for staging the ambush imputed to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is also noteworthy that the aforementioned defense
witness Generoso Sevilla, who testified in favor of appellant Jesus Lagnas, is
the younger brother of the lone prosecution witness, Renato Sevilla.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
We are of the reasoned belief that what motivated the former to contradict his
brother's testimony is none other than the sincere desire to divulge and stand
for the truth and do justice to the innocent appellants.  There is no evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Implementing the Constitutional mandate, it is embodied in our
Rules of Court that "(i)n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be
entitled to be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved beyond reasonable
doubt."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
This principle of universal acceptance has led us to the oft-quoted ruling that
-?</p>

<blockquote>"Accusation is not, according to the fundamental law,
synonymous with guilt; the prosecution must overthrow the presumption of
innocence with proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  To meet this standard, there is need for the
most careful scrutiny of the testimony of the State, both oral and documentary,
independently of whatever defense is offered by the accused.  Only if the judge below and the appellate
tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the crime had been committed
precisely by the person on trial under such an exacting test should the
sentence be one of conviction.  It is
thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into
account.  The proof against him must
survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to
sway judgment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise basic in our criminal laws that the prosecution
cannot draw its strength from the weakness of the defense.  The evidence of the People must be strong
enough to stand on its own two feet instead of leaning on the crutches of the
evidence for the defense.  It must be
strong enough to convince this Court that the prisoner in the dock must be
punished, not because he cannot prove that he is innocent, but because it has proved
that he is guilty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Once again, albeit in effect a supportive and cumulative
consideration in view of the preceding disquisition, the "equipoise"
rule finds application in this case, that is, if the inculpatory facts and
circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his
guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is
not sufficient to support a conviction.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the confluence of the proven circumstances against the cause championed
by the prosecution, especially the tenuous identification of appellants within
an ambience of mercurial testimony, of the lone eyewitness offered by the
prosecution, must ineluctably result in a favorable verdict for the defense.</p>
