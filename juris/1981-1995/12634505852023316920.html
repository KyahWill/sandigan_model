				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This application for the writ of habeas corpus was filed by
petitioner on September 17, 1981, seeking the release of her husband, Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span>, alleging that he "is presently restrained of
his liberty originally from August 6 to 9, 1981, and then subsequently, from
August 17, 1981 up to [that] date, despite the fact that no warrant of arrest
nor any criminal charges have been filed against the detainee."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
She further stated that she "cannot <span style="">produce
any copy of the commitment <span class="GramE">nor</span> the cause of detention
of Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> because none has been issued and
the restraint is without any legal authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To the best of [</span><span style="">her] </span><span style="">knowledge, </span><span style="">[he] </span><span style="">does not have any

Diego, Chief of the Investigation and Legal
Panel of the Presidential Security Command, with the allegation that he
"holds office at the <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span> Park, Manila, in
which premises he and his co-respondents have since detained and held the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> in
custody."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The writ was issued on the very </span>same
day the petition was filed requiring respondents to make a return of the writ
on or before <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="9">Wednesday, September 23,
 1981</st1:date>, and setting the hearing on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="9">Thursday, September 24, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in the return to the writ of habeas corpus filed
on <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1981</st1:date>
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's</span> husband, Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span>, has not been unlawfully detained or restrained of
his liberty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[What occurred was] that
[he] had been invited by respondent, in his capacity as Chief, Investigation
and Legal Panel of the Presidential Security Command (<span class="SpellE">PSC</span>),
to shed light on complaints linking him, as a corporate officer, to multimillion
fraudulent loan transactions where victims are banking institutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">magnitude of these
transactions pose[</span>s] grave and serious repercussion[s] on the economic
viability of the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The investigation was held at the
Presidential Security Command, specifically in the office of respondent Col.
Diego who is the Chief, Investigation and Legal Panel, <span class="SpellE">PSC</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>During the investigation, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> stayed
at the <span class="SpellE">PSC</span> premises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was, however, free to go home at anytime and free to communicate with
anybody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the investigation or on <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1981</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> left the premises of the <span class="SpellE">PSC</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore not under the custody or any
kind of restraint by the respon­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The</span> results of the
investigation are now being evaluated by proper authorities."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the petition was duly heard on <st1:date year="1981" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the hearing, a resolution was issued to
the following effect:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"When this
case was called for hearing this morning, Atty. <span style="">Jose </span>T. <span class="SpellE">Sumcad</span>,
appeared and argued for petitioner while Assistant Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Reynato</span> <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, assisted by
Assistant Solicitor General Eduardo Montenegro and Solicitor <span class="SpellE">Oswaldo</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>, appeared and
argued for respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Detainee Pablo
C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> and his wife petitioner <span class="SpellE">Emiteria</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> were present
in Court. Detainee Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> answered
questions of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
Resolved (a) in the meantime to order the release of detainee Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> on the recognizance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sumcad</span>;
and (b) require the Office of the Solicitor General to submit, within five (5)
days from today, a rejoinder to the petitioner's reply and a manifestation,
after ascertaining from respondent Colonel <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> V.
Diego whether or not detainee Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> has
been released from custody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the case shall be considered submitted for decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The very next day, a manifestation came from respondent Col. Diego affirming
"that Mr. Pablo C. <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> is free; that he is
not unlawfully detained nor restrained of his liberty by the Presidential
Security Command; and that he is not being and has never been required to
return to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">PSC</span></span><span style="">."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There was a reiteration in the manifestation for the dismissal of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reference to the rejoinder of petitioner was necessitated by
the allegations therein that the use of the word "invited" was
"a euphemism for <span style="">actual forcible
apprehension and custodial detention."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> There was likewise an assertion by
petitioner that she was unaware of any "complaints linking" her
husband as a corporate officer "to multi-million fraudulent loan
transactions <span class="GramE">where</span> victims are banking
institutions."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Moreover, there was a claim in said
rejoinder that <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> was being compelled to sign
an affidavit prepared at the instance of respondent Col. Diego which will
justify the detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Reply of
respondent submitted on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="9"><span style="">September 30, 1981</span></st1:date><span style=""> there was a denial of such imputations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stressed that the rejoinder should not
be given any credence especially as to the statement that respondent Col. Diego
resorted to tactics which, to say the least, were unethical, characterizing the
accusation hurled at his good name as "reckless and irresponsible [which]
need not further be discussed."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the petition is thus warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's husband, Pablo <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span>, as of the date of the hearing, was not under
detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption that
he was detained which was denied by respondent Colonel, he was no longer
so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was under no compulsion to return
to the office of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His freedom
of movement has been from that time unrestricted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no confinement that could be the
basis of a petition of this character.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It may be further mentioned that his own statements, grudgingly made and
at times evasive, give rise to doubts about his lack of awareness as to why he
was interrogated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efforts of counsel
present at the hearing did not contribute too much either to dispel such
doubts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, it is well that
in the last pleading of petitioner, as prolix as earlier ones, it was made
manifest that it was prepared by and came from a member of the bar, unlike
previous ones from her, ostensibly the product of her pen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even she should have realized that it was too
much to expect that she would be endowed with that facility in the use of legal
terms and the requisite understanding of acts with a legal significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Candor, it goes without saying, is required
from members of the bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
even on the assumption that respondent could be held <span style="">liable for </span>conduct condemnable in <span class="GramE">law,</span>
habeas corpus is not the proper remedy, once there is a showing of absence of
detention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could be filed the
appropriate civil, criminal or administrative action.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, it cannot be too strongly stressed that while
the surveillance of Pablo <span class="SpellE">Villaber</span> may be warranted,
it is essential that in the process, there be no violation of his
constitutional right to enjoy his liberty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, if a charge is warranted, there should be a warrant of arrest
duly issued and, if <span class="SpellE">bailable</span>, his right to bail
should be respected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The imputation of
his being guilty of nefarious acts does not excuse compliance from the
operation of the rule of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, however, a moot and academic aspect has been imparted
to the matter at hand.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>
