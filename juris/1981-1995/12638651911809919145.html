the warrants of seizure and detention issued and signed by the Collector of
Customs; and (2) to recover the confiscated goods seized under these general
warrants, as well as damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on a verified report of a confidential informant that
assorted electronic and electrical equipment and other articles illegally
imported into the Philippines by a syndicate engaged in unlawful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"shipside" activities (foreign
goods are unloaded from foreign ships in transit through Philippine waters into
motorized bancas and landed on Philippine soil without passing through the
Bureau of Customs, thereby evading payment of the corresponding customs duties
and taxes thereon) were found inside "Tom's Electronics" and
"Sony Merchandising (Philippines)" stores located at 690 and 691 Gonzalo
Puyat corner Evangelista Street, Quiapo, Manila, a letter-request dated April
23, 1976 was addressed to the Collector of Customs by the Deputy Director of
the Regional Anti-Smuggling Action Center, Manila Bay Area (RASAC-MBA) for the
issuance of warrants of seizure and detention.  After evaluation, the Collector of Customs issued Warrants of Seizure
and Detention Nos. 14925 and 14925-A, directing the Anti-Smuggling Action
Center to seize the goods mentioned therein, which read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

it implemented with the assistance of:  (1) the National Customs Police (augmenting the team with two members),
(2) the Detective Bureau of the Manila Western Police District Headquarters (with
three detectives), as well as, (3) Precinct 3 of the Manila Western Police
District which exercised jurisdictional control over the place to </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">raided.  The intended raid was entered in the respective police blotters of the
police detective bureaus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the strength of the
warrants of seizure and detention, the raid was conducted in the afternoon of
April 25, 1976 at the two stores of the petitioner.  ASAC team leader Gener Sula, together with his agents Badron </span>Dobli,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Arturo Manuel, Rodolfo Molina and Servillano

and Cargo Disposal Unit of the Bureau of Customs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1976, in the afternoon, the hearing officer of Acting
Collector of Customs Alfredo Francisco conducted a hearing on the confiscation
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the goods taken by Gener Sula and
his agents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two days later, petitioner Tomas Chia filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> to enjoin the Collector of Customs and/or his
agents from further proceeding with the forefeiture hearing and prayed that the
search warrants be declared null and void, that the respondents be ordered to
return the confiscated articles to the petitioner, and to pay damages.  Upon filing a P1,000-bond, the Court issued
a writ of preliminary injunction to stop the forfeiture proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">issue </span>raised
in the petition is whether the warrants of seizure and detention (or Seizure
Identifications Nos. 14925 and 14925-A) are general warrants issued in
violation of Rule 126, Section 3, of the Rules of Court which provides that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"A search warrant shall not issue but upon probable cause
in connection with one specific offense </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he
may produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the
persons or things to be seized.  No
search warrant shall issue for more than one specific offense."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
under Section 3 of the Bill of Rights of the 1973 Constitution which provided
that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"The right of the people to be secured in their persons,
houses, papers and effects against unreasonable</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

violated, and no search warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon
probable cause to be determined </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by
</span>the judge <u>or such other responsible officer as may be authorized by
law</u> after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant and the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the
respondents contend that the goods seized from petitioner's stores by the
RASAC-MBA team were only those subject to customs duties and taxes but which
were not supported by any evidence of payment of those duties and taxes.  Those goods are subject to forfeiture for
having been imported in violation of Section 2536 of the Tariff and Customs
Code, as amended, in relation to Section 2530 (m)-1, which provides:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

of Customs and/or any other customs officer, with the prior authorization in <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">writing by the Commissioner, may demand
evidence of </span>payment of duties and taxes on foreign articles openly
offered for sale or kept in storage, and if no such evidence can be produced,
such articles may be seized and subjected to forfeiture proceedings:  Provided, however, that during such
proceedings the person or entity from whom such articles have been seized shall
be given the opportunity to prove or show the source of such articles and the
payment of duties and taxes </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">thereon."</span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

in this case, but the fact is that petitioner's stores - "Tom's
Electronics" and "Sony Merchandising (Phil.)" - were searched
upon warrants of search and detention issued by the Collector of Customs, who,
under the 1973 Constitution, was "a responsible officer authorized by
law" to issue them.  Sections 2208
and 2209 of the Tariff and Customs Code provide when a search may be made
without a warrant and when a warrant is necessary:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"A warehouse, store or other building or inclosure used for
the keeping or storage of articles does not become a dwelling house within the
meaning hereof merely by reason of the fact that a person employed as watchman
lives in the place, nor will the fact </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The warrants issued by
the Collector of Customs in this case were not general warrants, as erroneously
alleged by the petitioner for they identified the </span>stores <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to be searched, described the articles to </span>be
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">seized and specified the provision of
