<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners were the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 15080,
of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, 14th
Judicial District, <span class="GramE">Branch</span> IV entitled George <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, et al. vs. George <span class="SpellE">Yama</span>,
et al., for recovery of sum of money and damages with preliminary attachment
and garnishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herein respondent
Ricardo Gee, on the other hand, was one of the defendants in the said case, and
his properties, including two (2) pump boats, were<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> levied on attachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
trial of the said case, respondent Gee was absolved from any civil liability in
a decision dated June 30, 1980 (Record, pp. 68-79), and in an order dated March
31, 1981 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<span class="SpellE"><u>Ibid</u>.<span class="GramE">,p</span></span>. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">39),

properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On April </span>14, 1981,
respondent Gee filed a Motion to Condemn the Plaintiff and the Provincial
Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte for Damages (Record, pp.
42-43), alleging therein, among others, that the sheriff could not comply with
the Court Order to release the two (2) pump boats because earlier, said sheriff
without authority from the trial court and in conspiracy with the plaintiffs
(herein petitioners), released subject properties to the latter, in violation
of his duties as custodian of the properties under litiga­tion, and as a result
of which, said properties can no longer be found to his great damage and
prejudice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1981</st1:date>, Deputy Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Risma</span>, filed his
explanation and answer to the motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
</span>pp. 46-47).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1981</st1:date> (<u>ibid</u>., p.
49), said motion was held in abeyance until the trial court is clarified on the
matter since it appears that Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> had
delivered respondent Gee's one (1) 9-horsepower <st1:place>WISCONSIN</st1:place>
engine with Engine No. P-319-E <span class="GramE">91A,</span> and one (1)
10-horse power BRIDGESTATION engine to a certain <span class="SpellE">Valeriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Estorpe</span> for petitioner Maria <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> for safekeeping
on <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> was
ordered to inform the Court in writing within ten (10) days from notice whether
or not all the items belonging to respondent <span class="GramE">Gee</span> and
previously attached by him have been returned by him to respondent Gee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On August 15, 1981, Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> filed a Manifestation <u>(Ibid</u>., pp. 50-51) that
the said engines were all stored in the Office of the Clerk of Court of the
then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte for
safekeeping, and that he had already informed respondent Gee that he could get
the same any time during office hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He prayed that respondent Gee be ordered to get said engines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an Order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1981</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 52), respondent Gee was authorized to take delivery of the said engines, and
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> was directed to inform the Court of the
delivery of the same to respondent Gee.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 20, 1981, respondent Gee filed with the then Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, 15th Judicial
District, presided by herein respondent Judge, a complaint for damages and
attorney's fees against petitioners and Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Risma</span>, docketed therein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">as </span>Civil Case No. 3022 (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 17-19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same, respondent Gee alleged, among
others, that he is the owner of two (2) pump boats levied on attachment by
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> by virtue of the Order of Attachment
and Garnishment issued by the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> in Civil Case No. R-15080, that on March 13, 1981, the
then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> issued an Order
directing the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte
to release respondent Gee's attached properties to him (respondent Gee); and
that despite the said order, his pump boats could not be released to him for
the reason that Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> had earlier delivered
the same to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">petitioners and the
same could nowhere be located.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 8, 1981, petitioners moved for the dismissal of the
complaint on the ground that: (1) there was no valid cause of action (2) there
is an application for damages still pending between the same parties for the
same cause in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of Judge Mario M. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch IV, (3) the cause of action is barred by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>prior judgment; and (4) claim for
recovery of damages on account of the issuance of a writ of attachment cannot
be the subject of a separate action (Record, pp. 209-28).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After respond<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ent Gee filed his opposition (Ibid., pp. 54-55) and peti</span>tioners
filed their reply thereto, respondent judge, in an Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="19" month="3">March 19, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="GramE">Ibid.,</span>

<p class="BODY">The First Division of this Court, in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1982</st1:date>, resolved to require
the respon­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dents </span>to comment, and
to let a temporary restraining order be issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 80).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pursuant thereto, a temporary restraining order was issued on the same
date (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 81-82), and respondent Gee filed his comment on <st1:date year="1982" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1982</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 93-98).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="8" month="12">December
 8, 1982</st1:date>, the First Division of this Court resolved to require the
petitioners to file their reply (<span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span> but in
the resolution of <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1983</st1:date>,
petitioners' reply <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">was </span>dispensed
with; the petition was given due course and the case was submitted<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>for decision without need for the parties to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">file </span>memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, on <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="3">March 9,
 1983</st1:date>, petitioners filed their Reply to Respondents' Comment

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, the length of time that this case has been
pending and to determine whether supervening events may have rendered this case
moot and academic, this Court required the parties to move in the premises, in
the resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1988</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both counsels for the petitioners and for private respondent
manifested that no supervening events have <span class="SpellE">tranpired</span>
which would render the case moot and academic (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">One of the grounds upon which a motion to dismiss may be made under
Section 1, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court, is that there is another action
pending between the same parties for the same cause (par. e).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order that this ground may be invoked,
there must be: (1) identity of ties; or at least such representing the same
interest in both actions; (2) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed
for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (3) the identity on the
two preceding particulars should be such that any judgment which may be
rendered on the other action will, regardless of which party is successful,
amount to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">res</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">adjudicata</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>in the action under consideration (<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> Development Bank vs. <span class="SpellE">Buslon</span>,
48 SCRA 308 /1972/; and <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Victoria, 46 SCRA 139 /1972/).</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>the instant case, after
a careful study of petitioners' Motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to
</span>Dismiss (Record, pp. 20-29) and respondent Gee's opposition thereto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>pp. 54-55), the pre­sence
of the above-enumerated requisites of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">lis</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>or <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">auter</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> action pendant</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>is readily apparent (<span class="SpellE">Buan</span> v. Lopez, Jr., 145 SCRA, pp. 37-38 /1986/).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:175.5pt">There is no dispute that petitioners
and respondent Gee are the parties in both Civil Case No. 15080 in the then
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> and Civil Case No.
3022 in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte, and that in Civil Case No. 15080, respondent Gee's Motion to Condemn
the plaintiffs (herein petitioners) and the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte for damages (Record, pp. 42-43), is
grounded on exactly the same facts as in Civil Case No. 3022 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 17-19) which is the inability of the sheriff to
produce the two (2) pump boats of respondent Gee with a similar prayer for
damages against petitioners as defendants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore, undeniable that between the two cases<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>there exists identity of parties, or
parties representing the same interests in both actions, identity of rights as­serted
and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts, and the
identity is such that any judgment that will be rendered in Civil Case No.
15080, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">res</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>in Civil Case No. 3022.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been held that an action
involving the same issue, subject matter and some of the parties in another action
earlier filed by the defendant in the latter suit, shall be dismissed to avoid
multiplicity of suits (<span class="SpellE">Orellano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Alvestir</span>, 76 SCRA 536 [1977]).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent Gee's argument that when he filed
the complaint in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>
del Norte, he is deemed to have abandoned his motion with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">More recently, this Court had on several occasions condemned and
penalized "forum shopping" or the act of litigants of filing the same
suit in different courts (<span class="SpellE">Buan</span> v. Lopez, Jr., <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It was held to be an
improper con­duct that tends to degrade the administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Citing Section 17 of the Interim Rules and
Guidelines, this court held that a violation thereof shall constitute contempt
of court and shall be a cause for summary dismissal of all actions <span class="SpellE">pendinng</span> in the different courts (E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Inc. </span>et al. v. Philippine Port
Authority et al., G.R. No. 75197, Resolution, July 31, 1986; People v. C.A.,
101 SCRA 450 [1980]; <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> v. Lopez, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">More than that, this Court laid down the rule that the litigant's
resort to forum shopping "not only furnishes ground for giving their
present action short shrift, but also lays the foundation for an inquiry into
their liability for constructive contempt for having abused the processes of
the courts, and their counsel's own liability for the same sanction and such
other administrative responsibility as might be proper in the premises"
(Minister of Natural Resources v. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Orval</span>
Hughes 155 SCRA, pp. 567-568 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that in Civil Case No. 15080, the trial court
has already issued an Order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1981</st1:date> authorizing respondent Gee to take delivery of the engines
in question which reportedly were in the Office of the Clerk of Court for
safekeeping and directing Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Risma</span> to inform the
court of aforesaid delivery.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, respondent Gee, instead of complying with said order,
filed Civil Case No. 3022 in another court for the same cause.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b> the: a) subject Orders of respondent judge dated
March 19, 1982 and August 2, 1982 are hereby Reversed and Set Aside; (b) Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte, 15th Judicial
District now Regional Trial Court, is ordered to dismiss Civil Case No. 3022
