decision to the National Labor Relations Commission which, in a resolution

evident that appellant failed to furnish a copy of its appeal on the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> which is a fatal infirmity. </span>Under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Article 223 of the Labor Code, Section 9,
