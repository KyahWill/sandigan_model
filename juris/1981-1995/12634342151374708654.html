				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The appellants, Archie Distrito y Quiamco and Marne Mora y
Javierto, seek a reversal of the decision dated August 20, 1990 in Criminal
Case No. 8958 of the Regional Trial Court of Dumaguete, Branch XXX, finding
them guilty of having violated Section 4, Article II (drug-pushing) of Republic
Act No. 6425, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants were tried and convicted under an Information which
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the 28th day of September, 1989, in the City of
Dumaguete, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction <span style="">of </span>this Honorable Court, the said accused, conspiring together
and mutually aiding one another, not being authorized by law, did, then and
there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously deliver and sell to another person
more or less half a kilo of dried marijuana leaves, a prohibited drug.” (p. 17,
Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When the appellants were arraigned on October 27, 1989, they
pleaded not guilty.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented as witnesses the members of the 7th
Narcotics Command (NARCOM) stationed in Dumaguete City namely:  Patrolman Leon Quindo, S/Sgt. Ranulfo T.
Villamayor and S/Sgt. Ruben V. Laddaran and the Forensic Chemist of the PC
Crime Laboratory, P/Lt. Myrna P. Arreola.</p>

<p class="BODY">Patrolman Quindo testified that at around ten o’clock in the
morning of September 28, 1989, he proceeded to the Sta. Rosa Street jeepney
terminal pursuant to a tip that a certain Archie Distrito was selling marijuana
in that area.  To disguise his identity,
Quindo wore shorts instead of his uniform.  Seeing Distrito beside a parked <span style="">jeep,
</span>Quindo approached him and confided that he wished to buy one (1) kilo of
dried marijuana leaves.  Distrito
allegedly agreed to deliver the goods for which Quindo was to pay Distrito
P1,200.00.  They agreed to meet at 5:30
in the afternoon at the corner of Tan Pedro Teves and Sta. Catalina Streets for
the delivery of the marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quindo thereafter hurried back to his detachment office to inform
his Commander, M/Sgt. Villamor, who right away conducted a briefing and
organized a buy-bust operation.  Others
present at the briefing were Sgt. Ruben Laddaran, C2C Collet, Pfc. Noble and
C2C Wolfe of the NARCOM.  The plan was
for Quindo to go to the appointed place with his companions to back him up from
a discreet distance.  They planned to
arrest Distrito upon Quindo’s giving the signal which was to be his act of
taking money from his pocket.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses testified that Distrito appeared at the
designated place at 5:15 in the afternoon together with a companion, his co-accused
Marne Mora.  As soon as they came within
“a talking distance” (p. 7, tsn, December 20, 1989) of Quindo, Distrito
allegedly told Mora to hand over to him a black back pack bag which Mora was
allegedly carrying.  As soon as Quindo
reached for his pocket, his companions rushed toward Distrito and Mora and
announced that they were under arrest.  The appellants tried to flee but the fleet-footed NARCOM agents were
able to overtake and bring them to the NARCOM office where the black bag was
opened in their presence.  The bag
yielded marijuana which, upon being weighed, was found to weigh one-half (1/2)
kilo.  The microscopic, chemical and
chromatographic examination of the stuff confirmed that<span style=""> </span>it was marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused Distrito and Mora denied Quindo’s
allegation that they delivered and <span style="">sold
</span>dried marijuana leaves to <span style="">him.  </span>Distrito alleged that he had known
Quindo since the 1970’s (more than ten years) when his uncle, Captain Dominador
Distrito, was the jail warden.  He
alleged that at 6:45 p.m. on September 28, 1989, he was on his way to the City
Hall quadrangle to watch a basketball game when he met his friend and neighbor,
Marne Mora, a fourth-year high school student <span style="">at </span>Cathedral College, who was also going to the City Hall
quadrangle to watch the game.  While
waiting for the game to start at 7:00 in the evening, Distrito invited Mora to
a snack of “banana-cue” from one of the ambulatory stores near the gate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suddenly they were nabbed by NARCOM agents Quindo and Laddaran
who were holding .45 caliber firearms.  Mora tried to run but he was clubbed on the head with the butt of a
gun.  Both of them were hauled <span style="">off </span>to the detachment office at Lt.
Locsin Street.  The office was dark
because of an on-going black-out.  When
the lights came back, they saw a black bag on the table in front of them.  Quindo took the marijuana leaves and seeds,
weighed them (350 grams) and placed them in a brown envelope with the names of
the accused written on it.  During the
investigation of the accused, Mora was elbowed by an agent to force him to
admit ownership of the bag and its contents.  He was made to wear an army helmet which was repeatedly “knocked” (p. 10
tsn, June 25, 1990) by the investigators with their .45 caliber pistols.  Commander Villamor allegedly strangled
Distrito to force him to admit ownership of the bag.  Then the two accused were handcuffed and brought to the City Jail
where they were detained without being allowed to contact or consult a
relative, a lawyer or a doctor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1990, the trial court rendered judgment convicting
Distrito and Mora of the crime charged and sentenced them to suffer the penalty
of life imprisonment, to each pay a fine of P20,000.00 without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.  The half-kilo of dried marijuana leaves,
stalks and seeds subject of the offense were ordered confiscated in favor of
the Government and turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for proper disposal
without delay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied, the appellants appealed the decision to this
Court.  They filed separate briefs.  Distrito alleged that the lower court erred:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in giving credence to the theory of the
prosecution, the same being riddled with “bogholes of improbability;” (p. 40,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in convicting the accused of violation of
Section 4, Art. II of R.A. 6425, as amended, and even assuming that the
prosecution’s version is accepted at face value, the conviction should only be
for possession but, in any event, Distrito should be acquitted;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in not outlawing the so-called “buy-bust
operation” in question; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in not acquitting him on grounds of reasonable
doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Mora alleged in his brief
that the trial </span>court <span style="">erred in
finding him guilty </span>beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged,
contrary <span style="">to </span>the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is </span>merit in
the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the poseur-buyer, Patrolman Quindo, by his own
admission, was well-known as a peace officer <span style="">in Dumaguete </span>City.  He
admitted that, without a <span style="">disguise, </span>he
would undoubtedly have <span style="">been recognized
by </span>Distrito who had known <span style="">him </span>for
19 years.  Since his “disguise” was only
to wear short pants instead of his police uniform, the device was inadequate to
conceal or alter his identity.  Hence,
if Distrito was engaged in selling prohibited drugs, he (Distrito) would not
have been so foolish as to do business with Quindo whom he knew to be a police
officer.  <span style="">The </span>testimony of Quindo on direct examination reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Q.  You have as a matter of fact been too obvious as a NARCOM policeman, is
that not correct in your surveillance and in your operatives, you don’t hide
your identity?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
that <span style="">is </span><span style="">true, during the operatives and surveillance like </span>that, I <span style="">change my attire and appearance to be like a
buyer or user and hoo</span>ked <span style="">to the
drugs like that.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
mean, in the morning of September 28, 1989 when you were allegedly negotiating
with <span style="">Distrito, you </span>were <span style="">in disguise?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
were in disguise because you didn’t want him to recognize you as Pat. Quindo?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise
if you were not <span style="">in </span><span style="">disguise, you </span>would be known to <span style="">Distrito?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
was your disguise?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was wearing only short pants.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
did not cover your face?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>And your face was seen very well by
Distrito?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
as a matter of fact, this was in broad daylight in the morning at 10:00
o’clock?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except
for that short pants your appearance was not changed, you did not put on any
make-up or masquerade?<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
in spite of your disguise which was consisting only of short pants, you want
this Court to believe that Archie Distrito did not recognize you any more and
he was willing to <span style="">negotiate with you?</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.”
(pp. 10-11, tsn, December 20, 1989.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Another flaw in Quindo’s evidence is that although he alleged
that Distrito had been under surveillance as <span style="">a seller </span>of marijuana, he surprisingly did not know <span style="">Distrito’s </span>personal
circumstances.  He did not know <span style="">where Distrito </span>lived.  The transcript of his testimony <span style="">reads thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
you know that he is living in Dumaguete even if you do not know his exact
place?<b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
I do not know also.<b><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
mean, within the period of your surveillance you don’t know the personal
circumstances of Distrito?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No.”
(p. 9, tsn, December 20, 1989.)<b><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There was also a discrepancy between the quantity of marijuana
that Quindo wanted to buy, and which Distrito supposedly agreed to sell, (one
kilo), and that which was allegedly confiscated from the appellants (only 350
grams) in the black bag.  Moreover, the
ownership of the black bag was not established.  Distrito and Mora vehemently disclaimed ownership of the bag (p.
85, tsn, May 28, 1990 and p. 9, tsn, June 25, 1990).  During the cross-examination of Quindo, he was asked:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
did you take any effort to establish the ownership of the bag, were you able to
ascertain who the owner of the bag was?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am only certain that the owner is Mora because he was the one carrying it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Merely
on that assumption?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.”
(p. 29, tsn, December <span style="">20, </span>1989.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No marked money was seized from the accused as none passed from
the alleged buyer (Quindo) to the alleged sellers.  While Quindo testified that the agreed price was P1,200.00, he
did not state that he brought that amount of money to the venue of the sale, or
any amount at all, much less what denominations they consisted of.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, <span style="">Quindo </span>stated
that <span style="">from </span>the time he
“confiscated” the black bag from the accused, the money “remained with him.”
When he was asked for the whereabouts of the money, his answer was that he had already
spent it (p. 13, tsn, December 20, 1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">Quindo failed to explain why his supposed meeting <span style="">with </span>Distrito, at the corner of Tan
Pedro Teves and Sta. Catalina Streets at 5:30 p.m. actually occurred at the
gate<span style=""> of the </span>City Hall Quadrangle
at 6:45 p.m.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants’ allegation that they were not apprised of their
rights nor allowed to communicate with a lawyer <span style="">or seek </span>outside assistance, was not denied by the prosecution.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Quindo admitted a discrepancy between the number (281815 H) of
the brown envelope containing the specimen <span style="">and </span>the number stated in the Request for Examination (281615 H)
(pp. 9-12, tsn, May 23, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">Mora was not a party to the alleged negotiation <span style="">between Quindo and </span>Distrito at the
jeepney terminal in the morning of September 28, 1989.   Mora was never under surveillance.  The only link between him and Distrito was
that they were neighbors and friends.  The only evidence against them was Quindo’s uncorroborated testimony
that Distrito agreed to sell him 1 kilo of marijuana.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The NARCOM logbook entry for September 28, 1989 states <span style="">in </span>general terms that Distrito was
“arrested for violation of Section 4, Article II of R.A. 6425.”<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
Apart from that general statement, there is no allegation that they were
apprehended in possession of prohibited drugs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The loose ends in the evidence of the prosecution are sufficient
to engender reasonable doubt that the charges against the two accused were
trumped up.  Reasonable doubt must be
resolved in favor of the accused.  Therefore, without the requisite quantum of proof of guilt beyond
reasonable doubt, the conviction of the appellants should be overturned.  “Proof to sustain conviction must survive
the test of reason.  Suspicion of guilt,
no matter how strong, should not be permitted to sway judgment” (People vs.
Fontanilla, 199 SCRA 897).</p>

<p class="BODY">A judgment of conviction in criminal cases must be predicated on
the strength of the prosecution’s evidence<span style="">
</span><span style="">and not on the weakness of the
evidence for the defense (People vs. Lucero, 197 SCRA 717).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused are presumed innocent until their guilt is
established by proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The evidence against them must engender moral certainty or constitute
that degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind (Sec. 2,
Rule 133, Revised Rules of Court), a certainty that convinces and satisfies the
reason and conscience of those who are to act upon it (People vs. Bacdad, 196
SCRA 786, citing People vs. Padilla, 177 SCRA 129 and People vs. Salguero, 198
SCRA 357).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction against the
appellants, Archie Distrito y Quiamco and Marne Moran y Javierto, is hereby
REVERSED and SET ASIDE on the ground of reasonable doubt.  The appellants are acquitted of the crime
charged and their immediate release from custody is ordered.  Costs <u>de</u> <u><span style="">oficio</span></u><span style="">.</span></p>
