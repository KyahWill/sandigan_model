sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, according to the People's counsel, are, <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Complainant Martina <span class="SpellE">Subog</span> was a
31-year old <span class="SpellE">Manobo</span> spinster, somewhat naive and
guileless, barely four feet and eleven inches in height and eighty pounds <span style="">in </span>weight on October 4, 1976 when she
claims to have been raped by accused Ed Fernandez Avila, a 23-year old dump
truck driver of the public highways and resident of Camp I, <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the time, complainant was <span style="">a </span>public school teacher assigned at the <span class="SpellE">Sinuda</span>
Elementary School located in <span class="SpellE">Kitaotao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> and residing with Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roque</span> in the latter's house in <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, December 11, 1978, p<span style="">p. </span>3, 4, 18; February 3, 1988, pp. 2-3).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>According to complainant Martina <span class="SpellE">Subog</span>,
at about 9 o'clock in the evening of October 4, 1976, she was standing along
the National Highway in front of the house of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span>
at Camp I, <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>,
waiting for a ride home to <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
accompanied by her two co-teachers Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Tulba</span> and Mr.
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, p. 5,
47-48).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after, they saw a vehicle
coming from Don Carlos and going towards <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vehicle was <span style="">a </span>government dump truck driven by
accused Ed Fernandez Avila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> flagged it down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the vehicle stopped, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> with Martina
by his side, approached the vehicle and requested the driver (accused <st1:city><st1:place>Avila</st1:place></st1:city>)
to give Martina a ride to the <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span> town
proper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused acceded, saying 'yes,
sir', you let her ride'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11,
 1978</st1:date>, pp. 6, 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused <st1:city><st1:place>Avila</st1:place></st1:city>
then <span style="">resumed the travel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That being the first time the complainant and
the accused met each other,</span> the accused introduced himself to her as
'Eddie Avila' and asked her name to which she obliged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, pp. 8-9).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>When they were nearing Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque's</span> house
where complainant was residing, complainant asked the accused to stop the truck
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December
 11, 1978</st1:date>, p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused, however, did not stop the truck and instead invited the complainant to
dine at the <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span> at the market place near the
Municipal Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant declined the
invitation, saying 'Never mind Dong, anyway it is already late and beside our
place is already near'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11,
 1978</st1:date>, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On hearing her
answer, the accused drove faster until they reached the <span class="SpellE">carinderia</span>
at the market place, located half-a-kilometer away from Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque's</span>
residence (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon alighting from the truck, complainant
told the accused:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Thank you Dong, I'll
just hike to the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> because it is
already near.' The accused said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Don't
hike because you are only <span style="">a </span>woman and I'll accompany you home later on', and again invited
her to take supper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hesitating, she
acceded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After taking supper, <span style="">complainant thanked the accused, saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Thank you Dong, I will go ahead of you.' The
accused replied:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Board on the truck and
I will bring you home</span>'. <span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>So, the complainant again boarded the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused and one of his three
companions followed suit, leaving the other two at the market place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the accused started moving the truck
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December
 11, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, pp.

<blockquote>Upon reaching the crossing of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Pangantucan</span>, the accused suddenly turned the truck
toward <span class="SpellE">Malaybalay</span>, prompting the complai­nant to
inquire:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Dong, where is this truck
bound for'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused allayed her
apprehension by replying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Just for <span style="">a </span>short time because I will get
something'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, p.
12).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while, they reached <span class="SpellE">Panadtalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, where the
accused swerved the truck toward the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pulangi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprised, the complainant again asked the
accused where the truck was bound for and requested him to stop for her to
alight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused ignored her request
and kept on running <span style="">fast until they
reached the bank of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Pulangi</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December 11, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, pp. 13-14).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, the accused momentarily stopped the truck to let his companion
alight <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and then drove to a dry land in the
middle of the river where the accused finally stopped the truck (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, December 11, 1978, pp. 14-15).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon stopping the truck, the accused alighted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
then <span class="SpellE">approched</span> the com­plainant and started touching
her breasts (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to evade the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he still continued touching her, she bit
his arm (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This angered the accused who promptly covered
complainant's mouth with his palm and threatened <span style="">her:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'You crazy <span class="SpellE">Manobo</span>, I will let you float on the river.</span>'<span style=""> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December
 11, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, pp.
15-16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the accused forcibly pulled
her down from the truck, causing her to fall down to the ground on her buttocks
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December 11, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, p. 16).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the accused pinned her down on the ground in a lying
position with his left knee pressing on her solar plexus and his hands on her
shoulders, then forcibly pulled her shirt up tearing it in the process and
covered with it her hands and face (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, December 11,
1978, pp. 16-17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, the
complainant was already weak and exhausted and her ribs aching as if they were
broke (sic) and was unable to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12"><span style="">December 11, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, pp. 18-19).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused still pinning her down with one hand on her chest near the
neck, then with other hand held her two legs, pushed them upward on her face,
and then forcibly removed her trousers, panty and bra (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
December 11, 1978, pp. 18-20).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the </span>accused put himself on top of the complainant, and
tried inserting his penis into her vagina (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, pp. 19-20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com­plainant was too weak she could not
move anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused, thus,
succeeded in having carnal knowledge of her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She felt pain inside her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11,
 1978</st1:date>, p. 21).</blockquote>

<blockquote>After consummating his bestial desires, the accused freed her and
stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later when the
complainant regained her strength, she put on her bra, blouse and trousers (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11,
 1978</st1:date>, pp. 21-28).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she got back to the dump truck and was brought home by the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, pp.
30-33).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching home, complainant
immediately told her landlady, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, that the
accused had raped her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> summoned PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Salvaña</span>,
who was staying at Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque's</span> other house nearby, to
arrest the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> and Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Salvaña</span> brought
the accused to the police station of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1978" day="11" month="12">December 11, 1978</st1:date>, pp. 33-35).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appellant's claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His possession of the complainant's watch and
umbrella is not sufficient to prove that they were sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant had satisfactorily explained
the appellant's <span style="">possession of said
articles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she gave her watch
to the appellant when the latter asked to see it while they were eating and
promised to return it after they had finished eating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taking was seemingly innocent and the
complainant did not suspect that the appellant had base motives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q <span style="">&nbsp; </span>Do
you recall that when you were already in the process of eating the driver
herein took your ring?</blockquote>

wrist watch to him?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did not give, but because he told me, 'May
I see your watch,' so I removed my watch.</blockquote>

he kept that watch?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As for the umbrella, the complainant declared that when she
alighted from the dump truck, she gave her umbrella to the appellant when the
latter said:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"I will be the one to
bring your umbrella as you alight."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Surely, the appellant's possession of the wrist watch and umbrella of the complainant,
under the circumstances, cannot be considered a sign or proof that the
appellant and the complainant were sweethearts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affidavit of desistance,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
executed by the complainant on 19 November 1986, more than ten (10) years<span style=""> after the commission of the act complained
of, is also not a proof that the appellant and the complainant had been lovers,
for nothing is said therein that they had a previous love affair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the complainant stated in her affidavit
is that she is no longer interested in having the accused prosecuted and put to
prison; and that she had already forgiven him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The same affidavit of desistance will not also justify the
dismissal of the case as it was granted only after the institution of the
action.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Pardon in crimes against chastity, to be effective, must come before the
institution of the criminal action.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the appellant's claim is belied by the fact (a) that the
complainant reported the assault on her to her landlady, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, soon after their return to the house, <span style="">so that the appellant was immediately brought
to the police station of <span class="SpellE">Maramag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>,
and (b) by the absence of motive on the part of complainant to perjure herself
and impute the commission of such heinous crime to an alleged sweetheart.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such conduct, according to the Court, in one
case,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>'<span style="">'is hardly the conduct of a young woman who has just been transported
with ecstasy in the discovery of the pain and the sweetness and promise of a
portal that is opened to a tremblingly anticipated guest."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is improbable for the complainant, a public school
teacher, to fabricate matters and thereby undergo the travails of a public
trial exposing herself to humiliation and embarrassment by unraveling nasty
matters against her virginity by lodging against her supposed sweetheart so
grave and serious a charge, if not true.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the testimony of the complainant on how she was
assaulted and ravished by the appellant is credible and we find nothing
disparate or improbable in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testi<span style="">mony is corroborated by the medical
certificate which stated that the complainant, upon examination conducted on
the morning following the assault, sustained new <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span>
lacera­tions and the examining fingers had blood stains upon withdrawal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant had resisted the appellant
tena</span>ciously in the manner she was capable of, but she could not overcome
the appellant, especially after the latter had threatened her saying:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"You crazy <span class="SpellE">Manobo</span>,
I will let you float on the river."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, did not commit error in finding the
appellant guilty of the crime for which he was charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the civil indemnity awarded to the
complainant should, in our considered view, be eliminated in the light of the
pardon extended by her to the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the sole modification above-indicated, the judgment appealed
from is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against the appellant.</p>
