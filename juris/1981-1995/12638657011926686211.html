of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Branch 60, convicting accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Leoparte</span>, alias "<span class="SpellE">Emben</span>," of the complex crime of forcible abduction
with rape and imposing on him the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and the indemnification of the offended
party in the sum of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Taking an atypical but laudable stand in this case, the Solicitor
General, in lieu of an <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief, filed a
manifestation and motion recommending the acquittal of appellant since his
guilt had not been established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rare though such instances may be, it is
tangible proof that said government counsel, although tasked with representing
the prosecution against an appeal from a judgment of conviction, yields in
proper cases to the <span class="GramE">paramount</span> consideration that while
guilt should not escape, innocence must not suffer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our task then is to subject this case to a
painstaking review to ascertain the validity of the now joint submission of the
prosecution and the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was charged with abduction with rape in <span class="GramE">an information</span> which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned upon complaint filed by the offended party, <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea, accuses <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Leoparte</span> alias <span class="SpellE">Emben</span> (prisoner)
of the crime of forcible abduction with rape, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 16th day of September 1985, at Padre
Burgos, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Philippines and within the jurisdiction of
this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, armed with a deadly weapon,
moved by lewd design, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and
forcibly abduct the complainant <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea, against
her will and consent by taking and carrying her away from her home and bringing
her, thereafter, to different places where said accused, by means of force,
threats and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously had (sic) carnal knowledge several times with the said <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea against her will and consent." <a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> narrates that the prosecution
presented <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea, the alleged offended party,
who testified<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that on September 16, 1985, at about 7:00 P.M. more or less, she was returning
home by the railroad tracks from the house of her brother which was about two
(2) kilometers away, when appellant suddenly pulled her by the right arm
threatening that if she should shout, he would kill her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then allegedly succeeded in having
sexual intercourse with her at the nearby banana plantation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She declared that appellant first fondled the
different parts of her body, more particularly her bust, and kissed her several
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he opened her thighs,
inserted his fingers and later, his penis inside her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She allegedly resisted the appellant, but the
latter threatened to kill her with a pointed weapon if she would not surrender
herself to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the alleged assault on her honor, appellant brought her to
the house of his sister, arriving there at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00
 P.M.</st1:time> Appellant's sister, his nephews and nieces were present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, appellant had carnal knowledge of her
three times, despite her resistance and her telling appellant not to do it
because she was getting married to another man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, appellant allegedly boxed her in the thigh and again threatened
to kill her if she would not submit to his wishes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="9">September
 17, 1985</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 A.M.</st1:time>,
they left the house of appellant's sister and proceeded to the house of
appellant's uncle, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>, located at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Marao</span>, Padre Burgos, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant introduced her to his uncle, to the
latter's wife and to their children telling them that she and appellant had
eloped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She allegedly denied what
appellant said, but his uncle did not believe her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They remained in the house of appellant's
uncle for two days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the night,
they slept in a separate house which was also owned by appellant's uncle and
built just beside the latter's residence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, she was allegedly sexually abused by appellant three (3) more
times at <st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M., 9:00 P.M.</st1:time> and,
finally, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00 P.M.</st1:time></p>

<p class="BODY">Leaving the residence of appellant's uncle, appellant and the
offended party proceeded to the house of appellant's father, where appellant
himself resided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's parents,
his brothers and sisters were there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant announced to his family that she eloped with him, but she
allegedly told them to bring her home because her own mother, brothers and
sisters must be looking for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There,
she was once again allegedly abused by appellant in a room on the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following day, her parents, accompanied
by Philippine Constabulary soldiers, arrived and took her away and appellant
was arrested.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea went to the
municipal hall and talked to <span style="">a </span>certain
Commander <span class="SpellE">Aris</span> of the Burgos Police Station, who told
her to see a doctor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She consulted Dr. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Padre</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Burgos</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then returned to Commander <span class="SpellE">Aris</span> to consult another physician at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which she did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also gave a copy of the examination
results to Commander <span class="SpellE">Aris</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, she was investigated by Commander
<span class="SpellE">Aris</span>, which investigation was reduced into writing
and was marked in court as Exhibit "A."</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, on the other hand, adduced evidence materially
contradicting the prosecution's allegation of abduction with rape and intended
to establish that appellant and <span class="SpellE">Marinel</span> Idea <span class="GramE">were</span> lovers and that they agreed to elope that night of <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is claimed complainant's going with
appellant and the sexual relations between them were voluntary.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented as a witness one Pastor <span class="SpellE">Opo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Marao</span>, who testified
that the accused together with the offended party went to his house and
informed him that they eloped and intended to get married, so he told
appellant's mother to attend to the matter so that the two could get married.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1988</st1:date>,
as stated at the outset, a judgment of conviction was rendered by the court
below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant is now before us,
seeking the reversal of said decision on the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">I</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THIS CASE; and</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"</span><span style="font-weight: normal;">III</span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE PROSECUTION MISERABLY FAILED TO PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and second <span class="GramE">assignment of errors are</span>
palpably without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint by
the offended party provided for in Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code does
not determine the jurisdiction of the courts over crimes against chastity but
is only a condition precedent for the exercise by the proper authorities of the
power to prosecute.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The same not being jurisdictional, the failure of appellant to
raise said issue at the trial court barred him from raising said issue on
appeal, in consonance with Rule 117 of the Rules of Court, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 8.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Failure to move to quash or to allege any
ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- The failure of the accused to assert any ground of <span style="">a </span>motion to quash before he pleads to
the complaint or information, either because he did not file a motion to quash
or failed to allege the same in said motion, shall be deemed a waiver of the
grounds of a motion to quash, except the grounds of no offense charged, lack of
jurisdiction over the offense charged, extinction of the offense or penalty and
jeopardy, as provided for in paragraphs (a), (b), (f) and (h) of Section 3 of
this Rule."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 344 was not enacted for the specific purpose of
benefiting the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When it is said
that the requirement in Article 344 that a complaint of the offended party or
her relatives is jurisdictional, what is meant is that it is the complaint that
starts the <span class="SpellE">prosecutory</span> proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not the complaint which confers
jurisdiction on the court to try the case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The court's jurisdiction is vested in it by the Judiciary Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Such condition has been imposed out of consideration for the offended woman and
her family who might prefer to suffer the outrage in silence rather than <span style="">go </span>through with the scandal of a
public trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The overriding consideration in determining the issue of whether
or not the condition precedent prescribed in Article 344 has been complied with
is the intent of the aggrieved party to seek judicial redress for the affront
committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the active cooperation of the offended party in the
prosecution of the case, as witness, clearly indicates said intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the information filed by the fiscal
specifically states that the same was instituted upon the complaint of the
offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the third assignment of error, appellant contends that he is
entitled to an acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the severity of the penalties for the offense of rape,
the judiciary must take extreme care to avoid an injustice to the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span style="">a </span>reasonable doubt exists, the verdict <span style="">must </span>be one of acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape is an accusation easy to make, hard to
prove, but harder to defend by the accused, though innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence for the prosecution must be
clear and convincing to overcome the constitutional presumption of
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rape is an offense to which,
as is often the case, only two people can testify, thus requiring the most
conscientious effort on the part of the arbiter to weigh and appraise the
conflicting testimonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a <span style="">reasonable doubt exists, </span>the verdict
must be one of acquittal.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the evidence for the People is undeniably
insufficient to sustain a conviction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The uncorroborated, vacillating and inherently improbable testimony of
the offended party has itself created doubts as to the guilt of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, it failed to establish
the presence of violence or intimidation which is the common <span style="">element of the component offenses charged
here as a complex crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A number of
circumstances, culled from the testimony of the offended party, <span class="GramE">belies</span> her claim that she was forcibly abducted and raped by
appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Graphic illustrations thereof are found in the following
observations of the Solicitor General which we quote with approval:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1985</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1990</st1:date> appellant and
complainant transferred from one house to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They <span class="SpellE">travelled</span> by
the road, in broad daylight at that, meeting several people on the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant, therefore, had more than ample
opportunity to seek the help of other people and free herself from appellant if
indeed she was abducted and abused by the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She met several members of appellant's family
and relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At least one of them
could have disfavored the alleged abduction and could have helped complainant
had there been any perceivable indication of resistance on her part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the allegation of
appellant's sister that she suggested to bring complainant home because she
knew complainant's mother, but yet complainant refused as she would rather be
with appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This assertion of
appellant's sister on the witness stand remains <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly, the
house of appellant's sister where she and appellant spent the night after the
first sexual intercourse by the banana plantation is just a stone's throw away
from the P.C. Detachment (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <span class="SpellE">Leoparte</span>,
<st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1987</st1:date>, p.
11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right there and then, complainant
could have readily sought the help of the P.C. authorities if she wanted
to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she did not only <span class="GramE">points</span> to the inevitable conclusion that indeed she eloped
with appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Per complainant's own
testimony, the first in the series of sexual encounters between her and
appellant occurred at the banana plantation around <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The details of
this <span style="">first </span>sexual intercourse
were revealed during the cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The banana plantation adverted to is about 2 kilometers away from the
railroad track where allegedly appellant first accosted complainant (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span> Idea, September 18, I986, p. 30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, while she was sitting down in a
squatting position, appellant started to remove her <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>first her <span class="SpellE">maong</span>
shorts, then her panty, the blouse, and the skirt (Ibid, Nov. 27, 1986, p. 16<span style="">), </span>and appellant also removed her
brassiere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While appellant was engaged
in the ceremony of removing all her <span class="SpellE">clothings</span> and
underwear (according to complainant she was wearing several <span class="SpellE">clothings</span>
and <span class="SpellE">underwears</span> one after the other), he was kissing
her on the cheeks (Ibid, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
appellant transferred towards her back in order to loosen and remove her
bra.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From behind appellant continued
kissing her on the lips and cheeks, at the same time caressing her nipples with
his left and right hands (Ibid, p. 13).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, when both of them were totally naked, appellant made her lie down
on a banana leaf which appellant had earlier prepared as cover (Ibid, p.
18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the sexual act was consummated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This vivid description coming as it does from complainant
herself of the preliminaries and the sexual union itself between her and
appellant cannot be anything else but <span style="">a
</span>manifestation of a mutual passion and longing for each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the foregoing circumstances belie
any pretense on the part of the complainant that she offered resistance
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary complainant's
testimony is pure and simple lovemaking, immoral though it may be, yet still
lovemaking in the true sense of the art.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, a rapist, whose only objective at the moment is the satisfaction of
his lust, would not understandably have the time much less the concern to
remove all of his victim's clothing, including his own, and indulge in the
sexual act preceded as it was by such intimate and elaborate foreplay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the sexual union was consummated when
appellant and complainant were in total nakedness, appellant having removed
complainant's dress and underwear with such ease, only signifies that she was a
willing partner to the love tryst.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, complainant while describing the sexual <span class="GramE">intercourse,</span>
never mentioned on her own initiative any form of resistance from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For that matter, the resistance she claims to
have employed, albeit weakly, was only in response to the question of counsel,
aware perhaps that without resistance the complaint for rape against appellant
is doomed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Worse still is the reason
advanced by complainant for resisting the sexual <span class="GramE">act.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She allegedly resisted appellant not because
she does not like it but simply because she was already getting married to
another man.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the same vein, the subsequent sexual intercourses between
complainant and appellant in a house of the latter's uncle, where only the two
of them stayed for two nights, and in appellant's own house, were no less than
part of their pre-marital honeymoon.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They indulged in the sexual activity while being completely naked and
with such frequency and regularity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
resistance ever came from complainant except the lame allegation that she w<span style="">as </span>getting married to another man.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As complainant's
theory of abduction with rape crumbles, appellant's claim that they eloped
because they are sweetheart gains more solid grounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant admitted that the various woman's
dresses and <span class="SpellE">underthings</span> in appellant's possession
were hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, she failed to
explain why they were all in appellant's possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only logical explanation is that which
was offered by appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That when he
and complainant met on the night of <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1985</st1:date>, she was carrying with her some clothes, aside from what
she was wearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here again the physical
facts of the case belie any claim of abduction.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For when a woman leaves her own house with some extra clothes with her,
the theory of elopement is more credible than the allegation of abduction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellant's claim that
he and complainant eloped because they were lovers is further fortified by the <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testimony of Pastor <span class="SpellE">Opo</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain, who categorically stated that
appellant and complainant appeared before him seeking his help so that they
could be married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even reduced their
statements into writing and let them sign it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The prosecution's inability to present evidence to rebut this damaging
allegation only proves that the charge of abduction with rape is more imaginary
than real.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is
intriguing how complainant's parents and the P.C. authorities were able to
trace that she <span style="">was </span>with
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her parents must have had some
idea of the blooming love affair between her and appellant such that when she
disappeared her parents knew right away where to locate her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can, therefore, be safely assumed, without
fear of contradiction that the criminal case against the appellant was
initiated by the family of the complainant and the latter was only freed to sustain
the same." <a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The recital of the foregoing circumstances, taken not only from
the defense evidence but from that of the prosecution itself, cannot but
support the claim of appellant that the offended party went with him
voluntarily and that their sexual relations thereafter were with their mutual
consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are accordingly convinced
that, as prayed for by appellant and recommended by the Solicitor General, a
verdict of not guilty should be handed down in this case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
