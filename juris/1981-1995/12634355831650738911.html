<p class="BODY">Only Romeo Apolinario and Antonio Rivera were arraigned, because
Mario Sion was at large and so far as the records of this case are concerned,
remains at large still.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, appellants pleaded not guilty.  After trial, the court <u>a quo</u> found
both appellants guilty in a Decision dated 31 October 1990 of the crime of
robbery with homicide and sentenced them to suffer <u>reclusion perpetua</u>
and to indemnify, jointly and severally, the heirs of the deceased Simon
Hibaler in the amount of P30,000.00, plus the sum of P14,650.00 which represented
the total value of the personal properties and money which the accused took
from the home of the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The prosecution presented
Restituta Hibaler, the widow of the deceased victim Simon Hibaler, and Ernesto
Biboso, the next-door neighbor of the Hibalers, whose testimony can be
summarized in the following terms:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Around 2:00 o'clock in
the morning of 9 October 1989, Restituta Hibaler and her husband, Simon
Hibaler, were awakened by three (3) persons who had broken into their
house.  Simon got his flashlight and
directed its beam </span>towards the three (3) intruders.  Simon and Restituta recognized the intruders
and they were Romeo Apolinario, Antonio Rivera and Mario Sion.  Simon exclaimed in the local dialect
"kamo man lang gali" ("it was you all along").  The intruders promptly attacked Simon with
their bolos.  Restituta pleaded for her
husband's life.  In response, one of the
intruders struck Restituta on the face; she fell down and lost
consciousness.  When she regained her
senses, she saw appellant Romeo Apolinario taking clothes from their respective
hangers while the other two (2) were ransacking a trunk.  When they finished, the three (3) went down
to the first floor, to the dining room, lit a lamp and helped themselves to
some coffee.  Restituta said she saw the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">appellants on the first floor drinking
coffee through a hole she had made on the <u>sawali</u> floor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the intruders had left, Restituta went to the balcony and
called out for her son, Pedro Hibaler, and a neighbor, Ernesto Biboso.  Ernesto arrived ahead of Pedro, and upon
Restituta's request, went to the second floor and there found Simon bleeding
profusely.  Ernesto held the wounded man
in his arms and asked him what had happened.  Simon told Ernesto that Romeo, Antonio and Mario had attacked him.  When Pedro arrived, he too asked his father
what had happened but by then Simon was already very weak.  Pedro Hibaler and Ernesto Biboso put Simon
on a hammock in order to bring him to the hospital.  Simon, however, died before they could leave.  The son, Pedro Hibaler, with three (3)
barangay councilors, went to the police station to report the incident.  Pedro then went back to his parent's house,
accompanied by policemen.  Simon's body
was brought to the municipal hall where an autopsy was performed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented Dr. Donanito Hijosa who had
carried out the autopsy examination.  Dr. Hijosa identified his autopsy report which listed the injuries
sustained by Simon as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro Hibaler was also presented by the prosecution, as a
rebuttal witness.  Pedro testified that
when he first reported the crime to the police, he did not reveal the identities
of the three (3) assailants of his father, for the reason that policeman
Anacleto Habana was present at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">police
station, and Habana's stepson was married to the daughter of one of the
appellants, Romeo Apolinario.  Pedro
stated that he feared that appellants might disappear completely if he revealed
their identities in the presence of Pat. Habana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">For its part, the defense
presented appellants Romeo Apolinario and Antonio Rivera.  The two claimed that from the 7th to the 9th
of October 1989, they were in the house of one Estelita Dayao at San Roque
Street, Roxas City.  They testified that
they went to Roxas City to attend the "Halaran" celebration and to
buy fish which they proposed to resell in Maindang, Cuartero, Capiz.  They said that they left Roxas City only on
9 October 1989 at around 4:00 o'clock in the morning and arrived in Maindang,
Cuartero, around 8:00 o'clock in the morning of the same day.  Estelita Dayao testified for the defense and
corroborated appellants' claim that they had stayed in her house from 7 October
to 9 October 1989.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants are now before this Court raising the following as
alleged errors of the trial court:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in relying on the
testimony of Restituta Hibaler and Ernesto Biboso despite the incredible and
doubtful nature of such testimony;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in finding appellants
guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged despite the failure of the
prosecution to positively identify accused-appellants; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Granting that accused-appellants were indeed
positively identified as the doers of the crime, the trial court erred in
convicting accused-appellants despite the failure of the prosecution to prove
robbery as conclusively as any other essential element of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the first and second assignments of error, we note
that Restituta Hibaler testified affirmatively and firmly that Romeo
Apolinario, Antonio Rivera and Mario Sion had broken into their house, savagely
attacked her husband Simon and then proceeded to ransack their house and take
their money and other personal property:</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court considers that the foregoing testimony of Ernesto
Biboso as to what the dying Simon Hibaler told him is admissible in evidence as
a dying declaration.  A dying
declaration, which is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, is
defined in Section 37 of Rule 130 as "the declaration of a dying person,
made under the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">consciousness </span>of
an impending death" with respect to "the cause and surrounding
circumstances of such death"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> There
is no question here that Simon must have been aware of the imminence of death
for he died shortly thereafter before he could be brought to the hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">That both Restituta Hibaler and Ernesto Biboso were in a position
to identify appellants Romeo Apolinario and Antonio Rivera is quite clear:  both lived in the same barangay in which
appellants lived and had seen appellants several times before.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense questions the testimony of Restituta and Ernesto as
"doubtful" and "incredible", upon the theory that both had
failed to mention to Pedro Hibaler the names of the killers of his father; for
when Pedro reported the crime to the police, the police blotter indicated that
the attack had been carried out by unknown persons.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

think that the defense tries to make too much of the police blotter.  A police blotter is not a confession by a
suspect; neither does it purport to be a complete and irrefutable record of
what had happened at the scene of the crime.  It is no more than a summary report of the occurrence of the crime.  In <u>Ford v.

the Court held that entries in police blotters are only <u>prima facie</u>
evidence and inaccuracies as well as omissions therein may be explained during
a witness' testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"We are satisfied with private respondent's explanation.  Her initiative in promptly instituting her
complaint clearly manifests her honest intent to vindicate the wrong committed
against her.  She explained that shortly
after the incident between her and petitioner Uy, petitioner Ford came and
slapped her.  Thus, when the report was
made by private respondent to the police authorities of Dumalag, Capiz, the
immediate hurt and humiliation being felt by her was not only the slander
committed by petitioner Uy but, primarily and foremost, the slapping by
petitioner Ford.  <u>Hence, the police
report of private respondent focused on her being slapped by petitioner Ford,
although inadvertently omitting the incident with petitioner Uy in view of her
emotional state then, should not be construed to mean that private respondent
was not slandered by petitioner </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Uy</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the case at bar, the omission was

stepson who was married to Romeo Apolinario's daughter:</p>

cited by appellants in their brief affords them no comfort.  There, the witness not only kept silent
about the occurrence of the crime for two (2) weeks but had also kept the
information from the victim's father; the trial court accorded his testimony
very little credence.  In the case at
bar, the identities of the robber-killers were immediately conveyed by
Restituta Hibaler and Ernesto Biboso to the victim's son Pedro Hibaler, who in
turn, revealed to Pat. Himan who the killers were as soon as they were out of
the police station.  In addition, the
victim's widow, Restituta Hibaler, also informed the police who had slain her
husband.  The testimony of Pedro Hibaler
follows in relevant part:</p>

<p class="BODY">In their third assignment of error, appellants contend that they
could not be convicted of robbery with homicide because the robbery had not
been proven.  Appellants claimed that there
was no conclusive evidence that they had carried the money and other personal
properties away from the Hibaler house.  As already noted, Restituta had seen with her own eyes appellants and
Mario Sion ransacking their house and taking whatever they wanted.  Appellants claim that because Restituta did
not testify that they were still in possession of here personalty here involved
when they left the Hibaler house and because the missing items were never
recovered from them, there was no evidence to support a finding of guilt with
respect to the charge of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once more, appellants' contention must be rejected as without
merit.  The element of taking or
asportation in the crime of robbery, in the instant case, was completed when
appellants and Mario Sion took the personal property, even if (and this is not
true in the case at bar) they had had no subsequent opportunity to dispose of
the same.  Restituta had testified that
after the robbery, she made an inventory and found many of their personal
belongings missing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> The

established beyond reasonable doubt, the conviction of the accused is justified
