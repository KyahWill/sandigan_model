				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Should disciplinary action be taken against respondent judge for
having admitted to probate a will, which on its face is <u>void</u> because it is
written in English, a language not known to the illiterate <span style="">testatrix, and </span>which is probably a <u><span style="">forged will</span></u><span style=""> </span>because she and the attesting witnesses did not appear before
the notary as admitted by the notary himself?</p>

<p class="BODY">That question arises under the pleadings filed in the testate
case and in the <i>certiorari</i> case in the Court of Appeals which reveal the
following tangled strands of human relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mauro <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>, a corporal in the 45th
Infantry of the U. S. Army (Philippine Scouts), Fort McKinley, married <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> Salvador in 1923 (p. 150, Spec. Proc. No.
7816).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <span style="">childless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reared a boy
named <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> who used the surname <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> and who considered them as his parents as shown in
his 1945 mar­riage contract with <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> de Vera </span>(p.
<span style="">15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of
CA-G. R. No. 08654-R; p. 148, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of Testate Case
showing that <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> was 5 years old when Mauro
married <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> in 1923).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mauro died in 1942.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>, as a veteran's widow, became a pensioner of the
Federal Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That explains why on
her death she had accumulated some cash in two banks.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
begot a child named Lilia who became a medical technologist and went
abroad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
also became a soldier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was disabled
and his wife <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was appointed as his guardian in
1953 when he was declared an incompetent in Special Proceeding No. 1807 of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>
Branch I (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of CA-G. R. No. 08654-R).</p>

<p class="BODY">In that connection, it should be noted that a woman named <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span> de la Cruz wanted also to be his guardian in
another pro­ceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span>
tried to prove that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was living separately from
<span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> and that she (<span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>)
admitted to <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> that she was unfaithful to <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> (pp. 61-63, Record of testate case).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> A. Tan dismissed the second
guardianship proceeding and confirmed <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span>
appointment as guardian of <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of CA case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> has been staying in a veteran's hospital in San
Francisco or Palo Alto, California (p. 87, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">On a date not indicated in the record, the spouses Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hermogena</span> <span class="SpellE">Talan</span> begot a child named Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>,
who, when a few days old, was entrusted to <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span> de
la Cruz (apparently a girl friend of <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>) and who
was later delivered to <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> Salvador <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> who brought her up as a supposed daughter of <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> and as her granddaughter (pp. 23-26, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of CA-G.R. No. <span class="GramE">SP-08654-R).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marilyn used the surname <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stayed with <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>
but as not legally adopted by <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She married Oscar Medrano and is residing at <u>7666</u>
J. B. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>,
apparently a neighbor of Marina <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>, a resident of <u>7668</u>
J. B. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Street.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> supposedly executed a <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> will in Manila on July 23, 1973, when she was 73
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That will, which is in
English, was <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by her.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>She was illiterate. </u><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Her letters in English to the Veterans
Administration were also <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by her (pp.
38-39, CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that will, <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> bequeathed all her
estate to her supposed granddaughter Marilyn.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> died on November 15, 1974 at
the Veterans Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of her death, she was a resident
of 7374 San <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Olimpia</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She owned a 150-square meter lot and house <span style="">in </span>that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She acquired the lot in 1966 (p. 134, Record
of testate case).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 13, 1975, Marina <span class="SpellE">Paje</span>,
alleged to be a laundry woman of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> (p. 97, CA
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) and the executrix in her will (the al­ternate
executrix was Juanita <span class="SpellE">Macaraeg</span>, mother of Oscar,
Marilyn's husband), filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> Branch 25, a
petition for the probate of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina's</span> alleged
will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was assigned to Judge
Reynaldo P. <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As there was no opposition, Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
commissioned his deputy clerk of court, Evangeline S. <span class="SpellE">Yuipco</span>,
to hear the <span class="GramE">evidence.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The transcripts of the stenographic notes taken at the hearing before
the deputy clerk of court are not in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated March 31, 1975, Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
appointed Marina as <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, April 1, Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> issued <span style="">two
orders </span>directing the Merchants Banking Corporation and the Bank of
America <u>to allow Marina to withdraw the sum of </u><u><span style="">P10<span class="GramE">,<span style="">000</span></span></span></u> from the <span style="">savings </span>accounts of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> and Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> and
requiring Corazon Castro, the custodian of the passbooks, to deliver them to
Marina.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of Marina, Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
issued another order dated April 11, 1975, instructing a deputy sheriff to
eject the occu­pants of the testatrix's house, among <span class="GramE">whom</span>
was <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>, and
to place Marina in possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">That order alerted <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> to the
existence of the testamentary proceeding for the settlement of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina's</span> estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She and the other occupants of the <span class="GramE">decedent' s</span>
house filed on April 18 in the said proceeding a motion to set aside the order
of April 11 ejecting them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged
that the <span class="GramE">decedent' s</span> son <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
was the sole heir of the deceased, that he has a daughter named Lilia, that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was <span class="SpellE">Aga­pito's</span> guardian
and that Marilyn was not <span class="SpellE">Agapito's</span> daughter nor the
decedent' s granddaughter (pp. 52-68, Record of testate case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they questioned the probate court's
jurisdiction to issue the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the fact that Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
was already apprised that persons, other than Marilyn, were claiming <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Marcelina</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span>
estate, he issued on April 23 an order probating her supposed will wherein
Marilyn was the instituted heiress (pp. 74-77, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 24, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> filed in the
testate case an omnibus petition "to set aside proceedings, admit
opposition with counter-petition for administration and preliminary
injunction".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
in that motion reiterated her allegation that Marilyn was a stranger to <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>, that the will was not duly executed and
attested, that it was procured by means of undue influence employed by Marina
and Marilyn and that the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> of the testatrix
were procured by fraud or trick.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> further alleged that the
institution of Marilyn as heir is void because of the <span class="SpellE">preterition</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> and that Marina was not qualified to act
as executrix (pp. 83-91, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">To that motion was attached an affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Peñaojas</span>, the housemaid of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>,
who swore that <u>the alleged will was falsified</u> (p. 109, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Not content with her motion to set aside the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
order <span style="">(filed </span>on April 18) and
her omnibus motion to set aside the proceedings (filed <span style="">on </span>April 24), <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> filed the next
day, April 25, an opposition <span style="">to </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">probate of the will and a counter-petition for letters of
administration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that opposition, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> assailed the due execution of the will and stated
the names and addresses of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina's</span> intestate
heirs, her nieces and nephews (pp. 113-121, Record).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> was not
aware of the decree of probate dated April 23, 1975.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To that opposition was attached an affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Salvador <span class="SpellE">Teodocio</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Marcelina</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span>
niece, who swore that <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> never executed a will
(pp. 124-125, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Marina in her answer to <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> motion
to set aside the pro­ceedings <u>admitted that Marilyn was not <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Marcelina</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span>
granddaughter but was the daughter of <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> and <span class="SpellE">Arsenia</span> de la Cruz and that <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span>
was not <span class="SpellE">Marcelina's</span> son </u>but merely an <span class="SpellE"><u>anak-anakan</u></span> who was not legally adopted (p. 143,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> in his order of July 17,
1975 dismissed <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> counter-petition for the
issuance of letters of administration because of the nonappearance of her
counsel at the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She moved for
the reconsideration of that order.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a motion dated December 5, 1975, for the consolidation of all
pending incidents, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span>
reiterated her contention that the alleged will is void because <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> did not appear before the notary and because it
is written in English which is not known to her (pp. 208-209, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> in his order of June 8,
1976 "denied" the various incidents "raised" by <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> (p. 284, Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of appealing from that order and the order probating the
will, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> "filed a case to annul" the
probate proceedings (p. 332, Record). That case, Civil Case No. 24276, <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Paje</span> and <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> (p. 398, Record), was also assigned to Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
dismissed it in his order of February <span style="">16,
</span><span style="">1977 </span>(pp.398-402,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> in his order dated
December 22, 1977, after noting that the executrix had delivered the estate to
Marilyn, and <span style="">that </span>the estate tax
had been paid, closed the testamentary proceeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">About ten months later, in a verified complaint dated Octo­ber
12, 1978, filed in this Court, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> charged Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> with having probated the fraudulent will of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The com<span style="">plainant reiterated her contention that the
testatrix was illiterate as shown by the fact that she affixed her <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> to the will and that she did not know English,
the language in which the will was written.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(In the decree of probate Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> did
not make any finding that the will was written in a language known to the
testatrix.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> further alleged that Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, in spite of his know­ledge that the testatrix had
a son named <span class="SpellE">Agapito</span> (the testatrix's supposed sole
compulsory and legal heir), who was <span class="SpellE">preterited</span> in the
will, did not take into account the consequences of such a <span class="SpellE">pre­terition</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> disclosed that she talked
several times with Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> and informed him
that the testatrix did not know the executrix Marina <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Paje</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> the beneficiary's
real name is Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> and that she was not the next
of kin of the testatrix.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> denounced Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> <u>for having acted corruptly in allowing Marina
and her cohorts to withdraw from various banks the deposits of <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">She also denounced Evangeline S. <span class="SpellE">Yuipco</span>,
the deputy clerk of court, for not giving her access to the record of the
probate case by alleging that it was useless for <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
to oppose the probate since Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> would not
change his decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
also said that Evangeline insinuated that if she (<span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>)
had ten thousand pesos, the case might be decided in her favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evangeline allegedly advised <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> to desist from claiming the properties of the
testatrix because she (<span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>) had no rights thereto
and, should she persist, she might lose her pension from the Federal
Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> in his brief comment did
not deal specifically with <span style="">the </span>allegations
of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely pointed to
the fact <span style="">that </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nenita</span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">did
not appeal from the decree of probate and that in a motion dated July </span>6,
1976 <span style="">she asked for a thirty-day period
within which to vacate the house of the testatrix.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evangeline S. <span class="SpellE">Yuipco</span> in her affidavit
said that she never talked with <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> and that the
latter did not mention Evangeline in her letter dated September 11, 1978 to
President Marcos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evangeline branded as a lie <span class="SpellE">Nenita"s</span>
imputation that she (Evangeline) prevented <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span>
from having access to the record of the testamentary proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evangeline was not the custodian of the
record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evangeline "strongly,
vehemently and flatly denied" <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> charge
that she (Evangeline) said that the sum of ten thousand pesos was needed in
order that <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> could get a favorable
decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evangeline also denied that
she has any knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> pension from the
Federal Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1978 complaint against Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
was brought to the attention of this Court in the Court Administrator's
memorandum of September 25, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
case was referred to Justice Juan A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sison</span></span><span class="GramE"> of the
Court of Appeals for investigation, report and recommendation.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He submitted a report dated October 7, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> filed in
the Court of Appeals <span style="">against Judge </span><span class="SpellE">Honrado</span> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition
wherein she prayed that the will, the decree of probate and all the proceedings
in the probate case be declared void.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Attached to the petition
was the affidavit of Domingo P. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, who notarized
the will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He swore that the testatrix
and the three attesting witnesses did not appear before him and that he
notarized the will "just to accommodate a brother-lawyer on the
condition" that said lawyer would bring to the notary the testatrix and
the wit­nesses but the lawyer never complied with his commitment.<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition because <span class="SpellE">Nenita's</span> remedy was an appeal and her failure to do so did
not entitle her to <span style="">resort to the
special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> (<span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>, CA-G. R. No. SP-08654, May 29, 1981).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Relying on that decision, Judge <span class="SpellE">Honrado</span>
filed on November 17, 1981 a motion to dismiss the administrative case for
having allegedly become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that disciplinary action should be taken against res­pondent
judge for his improper disposition of the testate case which might have
resulted in a miscarriage of justice because the decedent’s legal heirs and not
the instituted heiress in the void will should have inherited the decedent's
estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">A judge may be criminally liable for knowingly rendering an un­just
judgment or interlocutory order or rendering a manifestly unjust judgment or
interlocutory order by reason of inexcusable negligence or ignorance (Arts. 204
to 206, Revised Penal Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Administrative action may be taken against a judge of the court
of first instance for serious misconduct or inefficiency (Sec. 67, Judi<span style="">ciary Law).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Misconduct implies malice or a wrongful intent, not a mere error of
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"For serious misconduct
to exist, there must be reliable evidence showing that the judicial acts
complained of were corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law, or
were in persistent disregard of well-known legal rules" (<u>In re</u> Im­peachment
of <span class="SpellE">Horrilleno</span>, 43 Phil. 212, 214-215).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Inefficiency implies negligence, incompetence, ignorance and
carelessness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge would be
inexcusably negligent if he failed to observe in the performance of his duties
that diligence, prudence and circumspection which the law requires in the
rendition of any public service (<u>In re</u> <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span>,
Adm. Case No. 134-J, Jan. 21, 1974, 55 SCRA 107, 119).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, respondent judge, on perusing the will and noting
that it was written in English and was <span class="SpellE">thumbmarked</span> by
an obviously illiterate testatrix, could have readily perceived that the will
is void.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the opening paragraph of the will, it was stated that English
was a language "understood and known" to the testatrix.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in its concluding paragraph, it was
stated that the will was read to the testatrix "and translated into
Filipino language".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 16, Record of testate case).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That could only mean that the will was
written in a language not known to the illiterate testatrix and, therefore, it
is void because of the mandatory provision of article 804 of the Civil<span style=""> Code that every will must be executed in a
language or dialect known to the testator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, a will written in English, which was not known to the <span class="SpellE">Igorot</span> testator, is void and <span class="GramE">was</span>
disallowed (<span class="SpellE">Acop</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Piraso</span>,
52 Phil. 660).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The hasty preparation of the will is shown in the attestation
clause and <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> acknowledgment where <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> Salvador <span class="SpellE">Suroza</span> is
repeatedly referred to as the "testator" <span style="">instead </span>of "testatrix".</p>

<p class="BODY">Had respondent judge been careful and observant, he could have
noted not only the anomaly as to the language of the will but also that there
was something 'wrong in instituting the supposed granddaughter as sole heiress
and giving nothing at all to her supposed father who was still alive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, after the hearing conducted by respondent deputy
clerk of court, respondent judge could have noticed that the notary was not
presented as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the absence of an opposition, respondent judge should
have personally conducted the hearing on the probate of the will so that he
could have ascertained whether the will was validly executed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, we find his negligence and dereliction
