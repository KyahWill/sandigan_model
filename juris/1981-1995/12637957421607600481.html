enjoin the enforcement of Section 5 (a) and (f) of Republic Act No. 2382, as
amended, and MECS Order No. 52, s. 1985, pending resolution of the issue of
constitutionality of the assailed statute and administrative order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We regard this issue as entirely peripheral
in nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It scarcely needs
documentation that a court would issue a writ of preli­minary injunction only
when the petitioner assailing a statute or administrative order has made out a
case of unconstitutionality strong enough to overcome, in the mind of the
judge, the presumption of constitutionality, aside from showing a clear legal
right to the remedy sought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
fundamental issue is of course the constitutionality of the statute or order
assailed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. The petitioners invoke a number of provisions of the 1987
Constitution which are, in their assertion, violated by the continued

<p class="BODY">Article II of the 1987 Constitution sets forth in its second half
certain "State policies" which the government is enjoined to pursue
and promote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners here have
not seriously undertaken to demonstrate to what extent or in what manner the
statute and the administrative order they assail collide with the State
policies embodied in Sections 11, 13 and 17.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They have not, in other words, discharged the burden of proof which lies
upon them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This burden is heavy enough
where the constitutional provision invoked is relatively specific, rather than
abstract, in character and cast in behavioral or operational terms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That burden of proof becomes of necessity
heavier where the constitutional provision invoked is cast, as the second
portion of Article II is cast, in language descriptive of basic policies, or
more precisely, of basic objectives of State policy and therefore highly
generalized in tenor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners
have not made their case, even a <u>prima facie</u> case, and we are not
compelled to speculate and to imagine how the legislation and regulation
impugned as unconstitutional could possibly offend the constitutional
provisions pointed to by the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to Article XIV, Section 1, of the 1987 Consti­tution, we
note that once more, petitioners have failed to demonstrate that the statute
and regulation they assail in fact clash with that provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, we may note -- in
anticipation of discussion <u>infra</u> -- that the statute and the regulation
which petitioners attack are in fact designed to promote "quality
education" at the level of professional schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When one reads Section 1 in relation to
Section 5 (3) of Article XIV, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>one
must, one cannot but note that the latter phrase of Section 1 is not to be read
with absolute literalness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The State is
not really enjoined to take appropriate steps to make quality education
"accessible to <u>all</u>" who might for any number of reasons wish
to enroll in a professional school, but rather merely to make such education
accessible to <u>all who qualify under "fair</u>, <u>reasonable and
equitable admission and academic</u> <u>requirements</u>".<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In the trial court,
petitioners had made the argument that Section 5 (a) and (f) of Republic Act
No. 2382, as amended, offend against the constitutional principle which forbids
the undue delegation of legislative power, by failing to establish the
necessary standard to be followed by the delegate, the Board of Medical
Education.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The general principle of
non-delegation of legislative power, which both flows from and reinforces the
more fundamental rule of the separation and allocation of powers among the
three great departments of government,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
must be applied with circumspection in respect of statutes which, like the
Medical Act of 1959, deal with subjects <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>obviously complex and technical as medical education and the practice of
medicine in our present day world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Justice Laurel stressed this point 47 years ago in <u>Pangasinan Transportation
Co., Inc. vs. the Public Service Commission</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"One thing, however, is apparent in the development of the
principle of separation of powers and that is that the maxim of <u>delegatus

adopted this practice (Delegibus et Consuetudiniis Anglia edited by G.E.
Woodbine, Yale University Press, 1922, Vol. 2, p. 167) but which is also
recognized in principle in the Roman Law (d.17.18.3) <u>has been made to adapt
itself to the complexities of modern government</u>, giving rise to the
adoption, within certain limits, of the principle of 'subordinate legislation',
not only in the United States and England but <u>in practically all modern governments</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People vs. Rosenthal and Osmena [68 Phil.

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We believe and so hold
that the necessary standards are set forth in Section 1 of the 1959 Medical
Act:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"the standardization and
regulation of medical education" and in </span>Sections 5 (a) and 7 of the
same Act, the body of the statute itself, and that these considered together
are sufficient compliance with the requirements of the non-delegation
principle.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The petitioners also urge that the NMAT prescribed in MECS
Order No. 52, s. 1985, is an "unfair, unreasonable and inequitable
requirement", which results in <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>denial
of due process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, petitioners have
failed to specify just what factors or features of the NMAT render it
"unfair" and "unreasonable" or "inequitable".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They appear to suggest that passing the NMAT
is an unnecessary requirement when added on top of the admission requirements
set out in Section 7 of the Medical Act of 1959, and other admission
requirements established by internal regulations of the various medical
schools, public or private.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners'
arguments thus appear to relate to utility and wisdom or desirability of the
NMAT requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But constitutionality
is essentially a question of power or authority:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>this Court has neither commission nor
competence to pass upon questions of the desirability or wisdom or utility of
legislation or administrative regulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Those questions must be addressed to the political departments of the
government, not to the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why the petitioners' arguments must
fail:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the legislative and administrative
provisions impugned by them constitute, to the mind of the Court, a valid
exercise of the police power of the state.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">police power, it is
commonplace learning, is the pervasive and non-waivable power and authority of
the sovereign to secure and promote all the important interests and needs -- ­in
a word, the public order -- of the general community.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

effort and regulation.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Perhaps the only issue
that needs some consideration is whether there is some reasonable relation
between the prescribing of passing the NMAT as a condition for admission to
medical school on the one hand, and the securing of the health and safety of
the general community, on the other hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This question is perhaps most usefully approached by recalling that the <u>regulation
of the practice of medicine</u> in all its branches has long been recognized as
a reasonable method of protecting the health and safety of the public.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> That the power to regulate and control the
practice of medicine includes the power to regulate admission to the ranks of
those authorized to practice </span>medicine, is also well recognized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, legislation and administrative
regulations requiring those who wish to practice medicine first <u>to take and
pass medical board examinations</u> have long ago been recognized as valid
exercises of governmental power.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, the <u>establishment of minimum medical educational requirements</u>
-- i.e., <u>the completion of prescribed courses in a recognized medical school</u>
-- for admission to the medical profession, has also been sustained as a
legitimate exercise of the regulatory authority of the state.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
What we have before us in the instant case is closely related:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>the regulation of access to medical
schools</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>MECS Order No. 52, s. 1985,
as noted earlier, articulates the rationale of regulation of this type: <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>the improvement of the professional and
technical quality of the graduates of medical schools, by upgrading the quality
of those admitted to the student body of the medical schools.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That upgrading is sought by selectivity in
the process of admission, selectivity consisting, among other things, of
limiting admission to those who exhibit in the required degree the aptitude for
medical studies and eventually for medical practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The need to maintain, and the difficulties of
maintaining, high standards in our professional schools in general, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">medical schools in particular, in the current
stage of our social and economic development, are widely known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We believe that the government is entitled to prescribe an
admission test like the NMAT as a means for achieving its stated objective of
"upgrading the selection of applicants into [our] medical schools"
and of "improv[ing] the quality of medical education in the
country".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the widespread use
today of such admission tests in, for instance, medical schools in the United
States of America (the Medical College Admission Test [MCAT])<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and quite probably in other countries with far more developed educational
resources than our own, and taking into account the failure or inability of the
petitioners to even attempt to prove otherwise, we are entitled to hold that
the NMAT is reasonably related to the securing of the ultimate end of
legislation and regulation in this area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That end, it is useful to recall, is the protection of the public from
the potentially deadly effects of incompetence and ignorance in those who would
undertake to treat our bodies and minds for disease or trauma.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners have
contended, finally, that MECS Order No. 52, s. 1985, is in conflict with the
equal protection clause of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>More specifically, petitioners assert that that portion of the MECS
Order which provides that</p>

<blockquote>"<u>the cutoff score for the
successful applicants</u>, based on the scores on the NMAT, <u>shall be
determined every year</u> by the Board of Medical Education after consultation
with the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">infringes the requirements of equal
protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They assert, in other words,
that students seeking admission during a given school year, e.g., 1987-1988,
when subjected to a different cutoff score than that established for an, e.g.,
earlier school year, are discriminated against and that this renders the MECS
Order "arbitrary and capricious".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The force of this argument is more apparent than real.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Different cutoff scores for different school
years may be dictated by differing conditions obtaining during those
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the appropriate cutoff
score for a given year may be a function of such factors as the number of
students who have reached the cutoff score established the preceding year; the
number of places available in medical schools during the current year; the
average score attained during the current year; the level of difficulty of the
test given during the current year, and so forth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To establish a permanent and immutable cutoff
score regardless of changes in circumstances from year to year, may well result
in an unreasonable rigidity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The above
language in MECS Order No. 52, far from being arbitrary or capricious, leaves
the Board of Medical Education with the measure of flexibility needed to meet
circumstances as they change.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that prescribing the NMAT and requiring certain
minimum scores therein as a condition for admission to medical schools in the
Philippines, do not constitute an unconstitutional imposition.</p>
