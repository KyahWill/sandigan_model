				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The accused Ruben Cruz, Jr. together with four others were
charged with Robbery with Homicide (P.D. 532, The Anti-Highway Robbery Act) in <span class="GramE">an Information</span> which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 4th day of March 1987 in Valenzuela,
Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, conspiring together and mutually helping with one another,
with intent to gain and with intent to kill by means of violence and
intimidation, that is by pointing and stabbing with bladed weapons against the
persons of Rosita Tan y <span class="SpellE">Olesco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> <span class="SpellE">Tojino</span> y Santos, did then
and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously take,
rob and carry away jewelries and cash money in the amount of P25,000.00,
belonging to said victims, while they were on board a passenger jeep <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> along Fortune 1, Angeles St., Valenzuela, Metro
Manila; that on the occasion of the said robbery and for the purpose of
enabling them to take, rob and carry away the aforementioned articles, the
herein accused in pursuance of their conspiracy, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously stab <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> <span class="SpellE">Tojino</span> y Santos on the
right chest, thereby inflicting upon the latter serious physical injuries which
injuries caused her death." (Orig. Records, p. 1) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The four other accused being at large, only Ruben Cruz was
arraigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the assistance of his
counsel, he pleaded not guilty to the charge.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Trial proceeded and a judgment conviction was rendered against him on <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, finding accused Ruben Cruz y <span class="SpellE">Delamida</span>,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the offense charged, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u><span style="">RECLUSION</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>PERPETUA</u>.</blockquote>

Records, p. 155)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are narrated in the People's
Brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1987</st1:date>
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was at the <span class="SpellE">Karuhatan</span>
market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went to that place to fetch
his wife (p. 4, TSN, April 1, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After he had fetched his wife, they proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
station at a corner street near the <span class="SpellE">Karuhatan</span>
market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were waiting for a
passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, a man (later on identified as
appellant Ruben Cruz, Jr., p. 10, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4">April
 1, 1987</st1:date>) approached Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> to have
his (appellant's) cigarette lighted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> let appellant lit his
cigarette.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They looked intently at each
other, '<span class="SpellE">nagtitigan</span> <span class="SpellE">kami</span>'
(p. 5, TSN, April 1, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>,
his wife and their child boarded the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant and his companions also boarded the
same vehicle (p. 6, TSN, April 1, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant sat at the rear left side near the door of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> sat beside a woman passenger named <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>, known to him because she was his former neighbor
(p. 7, TSN, April 1, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was running, a man said, 'Stop, this is a holdup’ ‘<span class="SpellE">Tigil</span>, holdup <span class="SpellE">ito</span>' (p. 8, TSN,
April 1, 1987) Appellant drew out a bladed weapon or <span class="SpellE">balisong</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then took the personal effects of the
passengers (p. 11, TSN, April 1, 1987). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Appellant had four companions at that
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of these five persons, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> could identify three of them (p. 11, TSN, April
1, 1987).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The robbers alighted after they had taken the personal belongings
of the passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was the
first one to alight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 13-14, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1987</st1:date>). The driver of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> chased the five <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>,
but he was not able to apprehend them because they turned towards an alley
where there was an open <span style="">gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>
fell on the floor of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
tried to support her with his hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver asked Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
to lift <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> said 'Pare may tama <span class="SpellE">ito</span>’ meaning that <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>
sustained wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span>
was brought to the house of her relative (pp. 14-15, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1987</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was not able to see exactly <span class="SpellE">Cleofe's</span> wounds, <span style="">but
he saw </span>that blood was oozing from her upper abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> was brought
by her relative to the hospital (pp. 15-16, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1987</st1:date>). </blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was light coming from a store at the place where
appellant asked that <span style="">his </span>cigarette
be lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in the very spot where
the holdup was committed there was also light coming from the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> post (p. 18, TSN, April 1, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
came to know that <span class="SpellE">Cleofe</span> died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He attended her wake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(p. 19, TSN, April 1,
1987).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with this
case, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was investigated by the
police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave a written statement
(Exhibits "B", "B-1", "B-2", "B-3").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Patrolman Antonio <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span>, a police
investigator of the Valenzuela Police Station, reported for duty on <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His tour of duty was from <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning (p. 5, TSN, July 15,
1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that date, while he was at the
police station, Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Dimas</span>, driver of a public
utility <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (PUJ) reported a case of robbery with
homicide which occurred in <st1:street><st1:address>Angeles St.</st1:address></st1:street>,
Gen. T. de Leon, Valenzuela, Metro Manila (p. 6, TSN, July 15, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dimas</span> informed Pat.

the Fatima <span class="SpellE">HospitaI</span>, and from there, he proceeded to
the scene of the incident and conducted an ocular inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that the place of the incident was
lighted (p. 7, TSN, July 15, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he returned to the police station, he investigated the driver and <span style="">some </span>of the passengers of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Driver
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Dimas</span> gave a written statement (Exhibits
"C-", "C-1") (pp. 8-9, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1987</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The next day, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 5, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> made a follow-up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He interrogated witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>passenger named Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> stated that he knew one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> to
accompany him to the place of the incident to find out if there were other
persons present thereat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not
find any other persons at the scene of the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span>
returned to the police station (pp. <span style="">11-12,
TSN, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1987</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span>
was already at the police station, an informant called him up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> was
told that the informant had seen one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sandig</span></span><span class="GramE">, accompanied by Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Guevarra</span></span><span class="GramE"> and Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Aguinaldo</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> went to the place where one <span style="">of </span>the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span> was seen by the
informant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they arrived at that
place, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> pointed to one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span> who, right then and there, was apprehended by
the policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arrested person was
brought to the Valenzuela Police Station (pp. 11-12, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1987</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the police station, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> organized a
<span style="">police </span>line-up
which consisted of five (5) persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out
of the five (5) persons in the police line-up, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
positively pointed to one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> talked <span style="">to </span>the person pointed to and when asked
about his name, he answered Ruben Cruz, Jr., Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span>
informed Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> that the person whom he (<span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>) pointed to, identified himself as Ruben Cruz,
Jr. (appellant herein) (pp. 12-13, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July
 15, 1987</st1:date>) Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig</span> investigated
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant told Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sandig</span></span><span class="GramE"> that he
(appellant) was one of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to appellant he had with him a <span class="SpellE">balisong</span> or fan knife and that he was one of those who
poked the knife at the passengers and took their jewelry, cash money and other
belongings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sandig's</span>
investigation of appellant was not reduced to writing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant refused to give a statement because
he had no lawyer (pp. 14-15, TSN, <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="7">July

<p class="BODY">Professing his innocence of the crime, the accused maintains that
the trial court committed the following errors in the evaluation of his case:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT BELOW ERRED IN CONVICTING THE

THE ACCUSED UPON THE WEAKNESS OF THE DEFENSE AND NOT BASED UPON THE STRENGTH OF
THE EVIDENCE OF THE PROSECUTION." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
83-84)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The errors assigned by the accused-appellant are inter-related
and narrow down to the basic issue of credibility of the prosecution
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall, therefore, discuss
the issues jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ruben Cruz contends that the testimony of prosecution witness
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> is replete with contradictions and is
very unnatural in many respects so that the same should not be given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention is not supported by the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused claims that it would be unnatural for him to request
a light <span style="">for </span>his cigarette from a
person who would board the same <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which he and
his companions intend to sack as that would risk recognition on their
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing unreal about the
appellant's <span style="">act </span>because when he
asked for the light he did not know that he and <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>
would be taking the same ride.</p>

<p class="BODY">This alleged inconsistency in the testimony of the witness is in
the nature of a minor detail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does
not affect the integrity of the witness' testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that inconsistencies on
minor details do not affect credibility as they refer only to collateral
matters which do not touch upon the commission of the crime itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Alegria</span>, G.R. No. 86455, September 14, 1990; People v. <span class="SpellE">Verzo</span>, 65 SCRA 324 [1975]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">What is material is that he was recognized by the witness Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> as one of the perpetrators of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was sufficient light <span style="">in </span>the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
coming from a nearby <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> post which enabled the
witness to recognize the people inside, the accused specifically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, buses and <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span>
are required to light their insides when transporting paying passengers.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other alleged inconsistencies are not material insofar as the
innocence or guilt of the appellant is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that a co-passenger Rosita Tan did not recognize or
refused to recognize any of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span> does not
detract from <span class="SpellE">Castañeda's</span> credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either Tan did not attempt to <span style="">look </span>carefully at the malefactors while
being robbed or she did not want to get involved as an eye-witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The remark that "the four of them
alighted” when there were supposed to be five is <span style="">also </span>a minor discrepancy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The witness was not pressed to explain the statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure to state the exact date when a
supposed relative, <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE">Narding</span>,
came to see him has no bearing at all on whether or not the appellant was one
of the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the eye-witness is a mere laborer is <span style="">no </span>proof that he was a paid
witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And h<span style="">is e</span>ntering a toilet together with the lawyer and father of the
victim cannot lead to any presumption that he was paid inside the toilet.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused failed to discredit the key witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court pointed out, the witness
was emphatic about the details of the incident when he was narrating them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The recognition of the accused as one of the
perpetrators "was unflinchingly established by the witness whose
credibility the defense failed to assail." Neither has the
defendant-appellant convincingly shown any ill-motive on the part of the
prosecution witness to falsely testify against him (People v. <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>, G.R. No.
80533, July 30, 1990; People v. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, 64 SCRA
350 [1975]).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the records, we can see that the said witness showed no
hostility but only an interest in bringing the malefactors to justice (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Mandal</span>, G.R. No. 87959, August 13, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused himself admitted that he did not know Romeo <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> prior to the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was neither quarrel nor
misunderstanding between them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant's insinuation that said witness testified for money is not
borne by the records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has not
substantiated his claim to merit any consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of witness <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was
corroborated by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sandig</span></span><span class="GramE"> who testified that <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> was able to
positively pinpoint the accused as one the <span class="SpellE">holduppers</span>
during the police line-up.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of appellant hinges primarily on alibi which, as we
have repeatedly declared, is one of the weakest defenses that may be invoked by
<span style="">an </span>accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule once again that for this defense to
prosper, it is not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere when the
crime was committed but that he must also demonstrate that it was physically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot prevail over the positive
identification by prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is an issue of fact that hinges on the credibility of the witnesses
who seek to establish it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Arceo</span>, G.R. No. 88324, July 6, 1990 citing People v.
Coronado, et al., 145 SCRA 250 [1986]).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no physical impossibility existing since the place where the
accused <span class="GramE">claims</span> he was at the time of the commission of
the crime is also within the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> in Valenzuela
where the <span style="">public </span>market is
located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused himself admitted
that it took only about fifteen (15) minutes by passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
to negotiate the said distance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has invariably decreed that alibi cannot prevail over
the positive identification of <span style="">the </span>accused
as the perpetrator of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Lingao</span>, 75 SCRA 130 [1977];

<p class="BODY">The appellant's<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>claim of
maltreatment is uncorroborated and self-serving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that it has some basis, it
would be a ground for charges against<span style=""> </span>the police officers, not an argument for
acquittal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No written confession or any
kind of extra-judicial admission was extracted from him that would be
prejudicial to his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact of conspiracy has been well-established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the appellant's companions announced
the hold-up while the rest took the personal effects of passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant, according to the witness drew
out the bladed weapon and proceeded to rob the passengers as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group acted in concert in a
well-rehearsed or oft repeated manner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concert of action at the moment of consummating the crime and the
form and manner in which assistance is rendered to the person inflicting the
fatal wound may determine complicity where it would not otherwise be
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v.
Yu, 80 SCRA 382 [1977]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">While witness <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span> did not see the
actual stabbing of the victim by the appellant himself, the participation of
the accused in the robbery which resulted in the death of the victim is
definitely established.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the last analysis, the basic consideration centers around the
credibility of witnesses in respect of which the findings of the trial court
are entitled to great weight as it was in a superior position to assess the
same in the course of the trial (People v. <span class="SpellE">Salvilla</span>,
et al., G.R. No. 86163, April 26, 1990 citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>,
