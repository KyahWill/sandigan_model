				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The proceedings in the lower court which are narrated below were
culled mostly from the <span class="SpellE"><u>expediente</u></span> of the case
because the annexes to the petition are not well organized.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dominador</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Danan</span> died on
November 7, 1970, in <span class="SpellE">Lubao</span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not
leave a will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Service Engineers, Inc.
which claimed to be a creditor of the deceased filed a petition dated November
12, 1971, in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
praying that letters of administration of the <span class="SpellE">instestate</span>
estate of <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Danan</span>
be issued in favor of Engineer Carlos B. Navarro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was docketed as Special
Proceeding No. <span class="GramE">G-­22.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was, however, <span class="SpellE">Adoracion</span> F. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Danan</span>,
widow of the deceased, who was appointed <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
of the estate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 13, 1973, the court issued an order directing all
persons having money claims against the estate to file them within <span style="">six </span>(6) months after the date of the
first publication of the order which was December 10, 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="6">June
 12, 1974</st1:date>, Benito <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span>
filed a contingent claim in the amount of P98<span class="GramE">,411.17</span>
plus interest in anticipation of a deficiency after the spouses shall have
foreclosed a real estate mortgage which the deceased and his wife had executed
in their favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1974</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
filed an answer to the contingent claim wherein she admitted the existence of
the debt which was secured by a mortgage; however, she prayed that the <span class="GramE">contingent</span> claim be denied because it had no basis for the
mortgage had not yet been foreclosed and ergo there was no deficiency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notice was given by the Clerk of Court on July 26, 1974, that the
hearing on the contingent claim would be held on September 2, 1974, and in fact
there was such a hearing on that day wherein only the claimants in the person
of <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span>,
counsel for the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> did not appear because
according to the interpreter he was sick or attending to his fishpond which had
overflowed according to a son of the <span class="SpellE">administra­trix</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the request of Atty. Lorenzo P. Navarro
who represented the <span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span>, the court allowed
the claim to be heard without prejudice to the right of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
to present rebuttal evi­dence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that
hearing, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> testified that she and her
husband had a final judgment against the <span class="SpellE">Danans</span> for
P62, 574.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>80 with 12% interest
compounded annually, 10% of the amount due and unpaid for attorney's fees and
moral damages in the amount of P5, 000; that on June 6, 1974, the debt had
grown to P264<span class="GramE">,121.17</span>; and that if the market value of
the properties mortgaged and the P5, 000 award for moral damages be deducted
from P264,121.17, the net amount due would be P98, 411.17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following exhibits were marked during the
hearing: The Record on Appeal in CA G. R. No. 49109-R, Exhibit A - Contingent
Claim; the decision in said case, Exhibit B - Contingent Claim; Notice of
Judgment attached thereto, Exhibit B-1-Contingent Claim; Motion for
Reconsideration, Exhibit C - Contingent Claim; and Denial of Motion for
Reconsideration, Exhibit D-Contingent Claim. Atty. Navarro, however, asked that
the presentation of the exhibits be made during the next hearing wherein the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> shall be given the opportunity to present
rebuttal evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the
court set the next hearing to October 3, 1974, but was re-set to November 18,
1974, at the request of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> who said
that her lawyer had an urgent personal engagement in <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City on the first setting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="11"><span style="">November 18, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, the following order was given in open
court: "Counsel for the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> is given
ten (10) days upon receipt hereof within which to interpose objection, if any,
to the exhibits offered by Atty. Navarro<span class="GramE">. "</span> From
the tenor of the order which gave Atty. <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> ten
days <u>"upon receipt hereof"</u> to interpose objection, he did not
appear on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="11"><span style="">November 18, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
does not show that an objection was ever interposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 28, 1979, the court held in abeyance the claim of the
<span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span> pending the resolution by this Court of a
motion for reconsideration in <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Castañeda</span>, G. R. No. L-43607 which was decided on June 27,
1978, 83 SCRA 777, on an ancillary question.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 12, 1979, the court set the hearing of the contingent
claim of the <span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span> on January 28, 1980, but the
record does not show that a hearing was actually held on that date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1980</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span> filed a Motion to Resolve Claim <span class="GramE">Against</span> the Estate, dated <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Attached to the motion is a Statement of Account stating that the amount
of the defi­ciency judgment which the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span>
should be ordered to pay as of November 2, 1980, is the sum of P294,
298.26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion contained a notice
that it would be submitted for the consideration and approval of the court on
November 5, 1980, but the record does not show that it was so considered on
that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated November 18,
1980, the court gave the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> ten (10) days
from receipt to file her comment on the aforesaid motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same order stipulated that, "After
the submission of the same [comment], the instant motion is deemed submitted
for resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The record does
not show that the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> submitted a comment
as required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1981">January 3, 1981</st1:date>, the court issued the following
order:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting upon the Motion to Resolve claim against the estate
filed by the claimants Benito <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> dated October
24, 1980, based on the grounds therein stated which the Court finds to be
well-taken, <span style="">the said claim of P294,
298.26 as of November 2, 1980 is hereby approved and ordered </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">be paid, pursuant to Section 5 and 11, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court
and for failure of the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> to comply with
the order of this Court dated November 18, 1980."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1981">January 8,
 1981</st1:date>, that the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> filed an
Opposition to Contingent Claim against Estate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There the <span class="SpellE">adminis­tratrix</span> questioned the
jurisdiction of the court to entertain the claim "for being <span class="SpellE">exhorbitant</span> and shocking to the senses and that the same
was filed out of time or beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period provided by law."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, <span class="SpellE">Ines</span> <span class="SpellE">Vitug</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> died in a
vehicular accident on <st1:date month="12" day="22" year="1980">December 22,
 1980</st1:date>, so she was substituted by her co-claimant Benito <span class="SpellE">Manalansan</span> and their children, namely: Elsa, Gil, Anita,
Jesus, Luz and Martin.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="27" year="1981">January 27, 1981</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> filed a Motion for Reconsideration
of the Order of <st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1981">January 3, 1981</st1:date>
(which ordered payment of the claim of P294, 298. 26) on the ground that the
claim <span style="">was "<span class="SpellE">exhorbitant</span>,
shocking to the senses and that the same was filed out of time or beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period provided by law."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After an exchange of comments and reply to the Motion for
Reconsideration, the Court issued an order, dated <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1981">May 30, 1981</st1:date>, as follows: "For lack of merits, the
Motion for Reconsideration is hereby denied."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> now wants <span class="GramE">Us</span> to review the actuations of the lower court by raising
the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>"I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can a trial Judge legally and validly
consider, take cognizance of and render judgment on a claim filed against the
Estate in an Intestacy Proceeding when said claim was filed outside the period
prescribed by Section 2, Rule 86 of the Re­vised Rules of Court?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Can a trial Judge adjudicate and render
judgment on a contingent claim against the Estate in an Intestacy Proceeding on
the basis merely of the direct testimony of a claimant, such direct testimony
not subjected to the rigid test of cross examination by the adverse party, the
documentary evidence or exhibits presented by the claim in the <span style="">course of such direct testimony not having
been formally offered nor formally admitted by the Court and such claimant not
having formally rested his/her case; and that the adverse party against whom
the claim is being asserted not having had the opportunity to adduce <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> or rebutting evidence?</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"III.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can a claim against the Estate in an Intestacy
Proceeding that is not supported by the evidence on record be awarded?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, there is no question that the contingent
claim was filed two (2) days beyond the six-month period stipulated in the
order which directed all persons having money claims against the estate to file
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it is to be noted that
the claim was filed on <st1:date month="6" day="12" year="1974">June 12, 1974</st1:date>,
whereas the timeliness of its filing was raised only on <st1:date month="1" day="8" year="1981">January 8, 1981</st1:date>, in the Opposition to the Con­tingent
Claim against Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the interregnum
the <span class="SpellE">administra­<span style="">trix</span></span><span style=""> </span>had acquiesced to the entertainment
of the claim by filing an <span style="">answer
thereto on </span><st1:date month="7" day="11" year="1974"><span style="">July 11, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, and again by asking for postponement of the
</span><st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1974"><span style="">October 3, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">,
hearing wherein she was to present her re­buttal evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is not only <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
by her conduct but <span class="SpellE">laches</span> also bar her claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Tijam</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>, L-21450, April 15, 1968, 23 SCRA 29;
Rodriguez vs. Court of Appeals, L-29264, August 29, 1969, 29 SCRA 419.)</span>
Moreover, Rule 86, Sec. 2 of the Rules of Court gives the probate court
discretion to allow claims presented beyond the period previously fixed
provided that they are filed within one month from the expiration of such
period but in no case beyond the date of entry of the order of distribution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contingent claim of the <span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span> was filed within both periods.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The second and third issues are impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">True it is that the probate court gave opportunities to the <span class="SpellE">admi­nistratrix</span> to contest the contingent claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus she filed an answer<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thereto on July 11, 1974; a hearing was held
on September 2, 1974, but she did not appear; the hearing on October 3, 1974
was re-set to November 18, 1974 at her request but she failed to appear on the
latter date; she did not interpose objection to the exhibits offered by <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">Manalansans</span> as
stipulated in the order of November 18, 1974; and lastly the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> was given ten days within which to file her
comment to the Motion to Resolve Claim Against the Estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These notwithstanding, We believe that the
opportunities given to the <span class="SpellE">admi­nistratrix</span> were not
ample enough and do not meet the minimum require­ments for due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="6"><span style="">June 12, 1974</span></st1:date><span style="">, when the claim was filed it amounted to
only P98<span class="GramE">,411.17</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, on January 3, 1981, when the probate court approved the claim
it had ballooned to the enormous amount of P294, 298. 26.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noteworthy is the fact that the order
approving the claim does not explain how it reached that amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The probate court should not have been
satisfied with merely asking for objections or comments from the <span class="SpellE">administratrix</span> but it should have conducted a full dress
hearing on the claim by using its coercive powers if necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the orders of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
dated <st1:date month="1" day="3" year="1981">January 3, 1981</st1:date> and <st1:date month="5" day="30" year="1981">May 30, 1981</st1:date>, are hereby, set aside
and it is directed to conduct a thorough and full dress hearing on the claim of
the private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No special
