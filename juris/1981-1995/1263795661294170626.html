<p class="BODY">The principal issue in this petition (submitted for decision in 
Our Resolution dated <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="2">February 7, 
1977</st1:date>) is whether or not the Philippine Air Lines (PAL) was a 
government controlled corporation from 1957 to <st1:date year="1964" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1964</st1:date>. If so, the petitioner's assignors 
(employees of the corporation) would be given the rights of government employees 
as members of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS); if not, the PAL 
would be regarded as a private corporation and its employees would be members of 
the Social Security System (SSS).</p>
<p class="BODY">The pertinent undisputed facts indicate that PAL was originally 
organized under the Corporation Law as a private corporation formed for profit; 
that in 1949 the National Development Corporation (NDC), a government owned and 
controlled corporation acquired 55% of <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> capital 
stock; that on October 25, 1955, the then Department of Justice rendered an 
opinion declaring PAL NOT to be a government controlled corporation<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> within the purview of Commonwealth Act No. 
186; that PAL was then ordered to be a member of the SSS; that PAL paid its 
contributions (as employer) to the SSS from September, 1957 to September 7, 
1964; that its employees likewise paid their contributions for the same period 
to the SSS, that all the while PAL and its employees entered into collective 
bargaining agreements with each other; that during this period the PAL employees 
also enjoyed sickness, disability, retirement and death benefits from the SSS, 
including salary, educational, and housing loans.</p>
<p class="BODY">In 1968 <span class="SpellE">PAL’s</span> employees demanded from 
PAL and the GSIS payment of sick and vacation leave benefits pursuant to the 
provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 186, (benefits accruing from September 1957 
to September 7, 1964) on the ground that PAL was covered by CA No. 186; that 
both PAL and the GSIS virtually refused to accede to the demand, prompting 
petitioner (as assignee of the PAL employees) to sue in the Court of First 
Instance. In view of an adverse judgment against it, petitioner elevated the 
case before this Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find the petition devoid of merit. While it is true that in the 
case of <em>Philippine Air Lines Employees Association v. Philippine Air Lines, 
Inc.,</em> (11 SCRA 387, 396-397), We ruled that PAL is/was a government 
controlled corporation, this was only for the purpose indicated in R.A. 1880. 
For the instant case however, and considering the circumstances attendant 
thereto, it is clear that PAL is not a government controlled corporation within 
the contemplation of R.A. 186. Be it noted that PAL during the covered years was 
a member of the SSS and its employees were recipients of SSS benefits. For 
petitioners to now claim additional or similar benefits from the GSIS would be 
rather inequitable.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of 
merit, and the appealed decision is hereby AFFIRMED.</p><b>SO 
ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> 
Gutierrez, Jr., JJ., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur</span>.</span><br><br><br><br>

<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The Opinion reads — 
<p>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, the conclusion 
seems inescapable that the terms 'corporation controlled by the Government' used 
in Republic Act. No. 660 refer only to such corporate bodies falling under the 
category of those mentioned above over which the Government exercises directly 
or indirectly almost absolute control thru the ownership of substantially all of 
their capital stock. Corporations like the PAL, in which the Government owns a 
simple majority of their capital stock as an ordinary stockholder are not 
embraced by that term and therefore beyond the purview of the Act. </p>
<p>It is pertinent to call attention to the fact that under the Corporation Law 
(Act No. 1459, as amended), the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the voting 
stock or of the subscribed capital stock of a corporation is necessary for the 
exercise of certain corporate acts, such as the investment of its funds in 
another corporation or business (Sec. 17-1/2), amendment of the articles of 
incorporation (Sec. 18), disposal of all or removal of directors (Sec. 34), and 
dissolution of the corporation (Sec. 62). In all these cases, the 53% interest 
of the Government in the PAL obviously falls short of that majority necessary to 
control the said corporation."<span>&nbsp; </span>(Record on Appeal, pp. 224-226).
