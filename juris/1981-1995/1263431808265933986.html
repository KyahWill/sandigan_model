annul the Resolutions of the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="">*</span></span></a>
dated October 22, 1990 and December 3, 1990 upholding the Orders of July 31,
1990 and August 23, 1990 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 57, in
Civil Case No. 90-1335.  Respondent
Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the trial court that herein
petitioners, after submitting themselves for arbitration and agreeing to the
terms and conditions thereof, providing that the arbitration award shall be
final and unappealable, are precluded from seeking judicial review of subject
arbitration award.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on May 17, 1989, petitioner Chung Fu Industries
(Philippines) (Chung Fu for brevity) and private respondent Roblecor Philippines,
Inc. (Roblecor for short) forged a construction agreement<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
whereby respondent contractor committed to construct and finish on December 31,
1989, petitioner corporation's industrial/factory complex in Tanawan, Tanza,
Cavite for and in consideration of P42,000,000.00.  In the event of disputes arising from the performance of subject
contract, it was stipulated therein that the issue(s) shall be submitted for
resolution before a single arbitrator chosen by both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the aforesaid construction agreement, Chung Fu and
Roblecor entered into two (2) other ancillary contracts, to wit:  one dated June 23, 1989, for the
construction of a dormitory and support facilities with a contract price of
P3,875,285.00, to be completed on or before October 31, 1989;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and the other dated August 12, 1989, for the installation of electrical, water
and hydrant systems at the plant site, commanding a price of P12.1 million and
requiring completion thereof one month after civil works have been finished.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, respondent Roblecor failed to complete the work despite
the extension of time allowed it by Chung Fu.  Subsequently, the latter had to take over the construction when it had
become evident that Roblecor was not in a<b> </b>position to fulfill its
obligation.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Claiming an unsatisfied account of P10,500,000.00 and unpaid
progress billings of P2,370,179.23, Roblecor on May 18, 1990, filed a petition
for Compulsory Arbitration with prayer for Temporary Restraining Order before
respondent Regional Trial Court, pursuant to the arbitration clause in the
construction agreement.  Chung Fu moved
to dismiss the petition and further prayed for the quashing of the restraining
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent negotiations between the parties eventually led to the
formulation of an arbitration agreement which, among others, provides:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"2.  The parties
mutually agree that the arbitration shall proceed in accordance with the
following terms and conditions: ---</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">'d.  The parties mutually agree that they will

<blockquote>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Regional Trial Court approved the arbitration
agreement thru its Order of May 30, 1990.  Thereafter, Engr. Willardo Asuncion was appointed as the sole
arbitrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 30, 1990, Arbitrator Asuncion ordered petitioners to
immediately pay respondent contractor, the sum of P16,108,801.00.  He further declared the award as final and
unappealable, pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement precluding judicial review
of the award.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Roblecor moved for the confirmation of said
award.  On the other hand, Chung Fu
moved to remand the case for further hearing and asked for a reconsideration of
the judgment award claiming that Arbitrator Asuncion committed twelve (12)
instances of grave error by disregarding the provisions of the parties’
contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent lower court denied Chung Fu's Motion to Remand thus
compelling it to seek reconsideration therefrom but to no avail.  The trial court granted Roblecor's Motion
for Confirmation of Award and accordingly, entered judgment in conformity
therewith.  Moreover, it granted the
motion for the issuance of a writ of execution filed by respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chung Fu elevated the case via a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
to respondent Court of Appeals.  On
October 22, 1990 the assailed resolution was issued.  The respondent appellate court concurred with the findings and
conclusions of respondent trial court resolving that Chung Fu and its officers,
as signatories to the Arbitration Agreement are bound to observe the
stipulations thereof providing for the finality of the award and precluding any
appeal therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of said resolution was filed by
petitioner, but it was similarly denied by respondent Court of Appeals thru its
questioned resolution of December 3, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition anchored on the following grounds:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">First</p>

<blockquote>Respondents Court of Appeals and trial Judge gravely abused their discretion
and/or exceeded their jurisdiction, as well as denied due process and
substantial justice to petitioners, -- (a) by refusing to exercise their
judicial authority and legal duty to review the arbitration award, and (b) by
declaring that petitioners are estopped from questioning the arbitration award
allegedly in view of the stipulations in the parties’ arbitration agreement
that "the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and unappealable"
and that "there shall be no further judicial recourse if either party
disagrees with the whole or any part of the arbitrator's award."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">Second</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Court of Appeals and trial Judge gravely abused their
discretion and/or exceeded their jurisdiction, as well as denied due process
and substantial justice to petitioner, by not vacating and annulling the award
dated 30 June 1990 of the Arbitrator, on the ground that the Arbitrator grossly
departed from the terms of the parties’ contracts and misapplied the law, and
thereby exceeded the authority and power delegated to him.  (Rollo, p. 17)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Allow us to take a leaf from history and briefly trace the
evolution of arbitration as a mode of dispute settlement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because conflict is inherent in human society, much effort has
been expended by men and institutions in devising ways of resolving the
same.  With the progress of
civilization, physical combat has been ruled out and instead, more pacific
means have been evolved, such as recourse to the good offices of a
disinterested third party, whether this be a court or a private individual or
individuals.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Legal history discloses that "the early judges called upon
to solve private conflicts were primarily the arbiters, persons not specially
trained but in whose morality, probity and good sense the parties in conflict
reposed full trust.  Thus, in Republican
Rome, <u>arbiter</u> and <u>judge</u> (judex) were synonymous.  The magistrate or <u>praetor</u>, after
noting down the conflicting claims of litigants, and clarifying the issues,
referred them for decision to a private person designated by the parties, by
common agreement, or selected by them from an apposite listing (the <u>album</u>
<u>judicium</u>) or else by having the arbiter chosen by lot.  The judges proper, as specially trained
state officials endowed with own power and jurisdiction, and taking cognizance
of litigations from beginning to end, only appeared under the Empire, by the
so-called <u>cognitio</u> <u>extra</u> <u>ordinem</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Such means of referring a dispute to a third party has also long
been an accepted alternative to litigation at common law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sparse though the law and jurisprudence may be on the subject of
arbitration in the Philippines, it was nonetheless recognized in the Spanish
Civil Code; specifically, the provisions on compromises made applicable to
arbitrations under Articles 1820 and 1821.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Although said provisions were repealed by implication with the repeal of the
Spanish Law of Civil Procedure,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
these and additional ones were reinstated in the present Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Arbitration found a fertile field in the resolution of
labor-management disputes in the Philippines.  Although early on, Commonwealth Act 103 (1936) provided for compulsory
arbitration as the state policy to be administered by the Court of Industrial
Relations, in time such a modality gave way to voluntary arbitration.  While not completely supplanting compulsory
arbitration which until today is practiced by government officials, the
Industrial Peace Act which was passed in 1953 as Republic Act No. 875, favored
the policy of free collective bargaining, in general, and resort to grievance
procedure, in particular, as the preferred mode of settling disputes in
industry.  It was accepted and
enunciated more explicitly in the Labor Code, which was passed on November 1,
1974 as Presidential Decree No. 442, with the amendments later introduced by Republic
Act No. 6715 (1989).</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether utilized in business transactions or in employer-employee
relations, arbitration was gaining wide acceptance.  A consensual process, it was preferred to orders imposed by
government upon the disputants.  Moreover, court litigations tended to be time consuming, costly, and
inflexible due to their scrupulous observance of the due process of law
doctrine and their strict adherence to rules of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As early as the 1920's, this Court declared:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In the Philippines fortunately, the attitude of the courts
toward arbitration agreements is slowly crystallizing into definite and
workable form. . .  The rule now is that
unless the agreement is such as absolutely to close the doors of the courts
against the parties, which agreement would be void, the courts will look with
favor upon such amicable arrangements and will only with great reluctance
interfere to anticipate or nullify the action of the arbitrator."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That there was a growing need for a law regulating arbitration in
general was acknowledged when Republic Act No. 876 (1953), otherwise known as
the Arbitration Law, was passed.  "Said Act was obviously adopted to supplement -- ­not to supplant
-- the New Civil Code on arbitration.  It expressly declares that ‘the provisions of chapters one and two,
Title XIV, Book IV of the Civil Code shall remain in force.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In recognition of the pressing need for an arbitral machinery for
the early and expeditious settlement of disputes in the construction industry,
a Construction Industry Arbitration Commission (CIAC) was created by Executive
Order No. 1008, enacted on February 4, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">In practice nowadays, absent an agreement of the parties to
resolve their disputes via a particular mode, it is the regular courts that
remain the fora to resolve such matters.  However, the parties may opt for recourse to third parties, exercising
their basic freedom to "establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and
conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law,
morals, good customs, public order or public policy."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>In such
a case, resort to the arbitration process may be spelled out by them in a
contract in anticipation of disputes that may arise between them.  Or this may be stipulated in a submission
agreement when they are actually confronted by a dispute.  Whatever be the case, such recourse to an
extrajudicial means of settlement is not intended to completely deprive the
courts of jurisdiction.  In fact, the
early cases on arbitration carefully spelled out the prevailing doctrine at the
time, thus:  ". . . a clause in a
contract providing that all matters in dispute between the parties shall be
referred to arbitrators and to them alone is contrary to public policy and
cannot oust the courts of jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But certainly, the stipulation to refer all future disputes to an
arbitrator or to submit an ongoing dispute to one is valid.  Being part of a contract between the
parties, it is binding and enforceable in court in case one of them neglects,
fails or refuses to arbitrate.  Going a
step further, in the event that they declare their intention to refer their
differences to arbitration first before taking court action, this constitutes a
condition precedent, such that where a suit has been instituted prematurely,
the court shall suspend the same and the parties shall be directed forthwith to
proceed to arbitration.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A court action may likewise be proper where the arbitrator has
not been selected by the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under present law, may the parties who agree to submit their disputes
to arbitration further provide that the arbitrators’ award shall be final,
unappealable and executory?</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 2044 of the Civil Code recognizes the validity of such
stipulation, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Any stipulation that the arbitrators' award or decision shall
be final is valid,<b> </b>without prejudice to Articles 2038, 2039 and
2040."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the Construction Industry Arbitration Law provides
that the arbitral award "shall be final and inappealable except on
questions of law which shall be appealable to the Supreme Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the original Labor Code, voluntary arbitration awards or
decisions were final, unappealable and executory.  "However, voluntary arbitration awards or decisions on money
claims, involving an amount exceeding One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00)
or forty-percent (40%) of the paid-up capital of the respondent employer,
whichever is lower, may be appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission
on any of the following grounds:  (a)
abuse of discretion; and (b) gross incompetence."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be noted that the appeal in the instances cited were to be made to the
National Labor Relations Commission and not to the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the subsequent deletion of the above-cited provision from
the Labor Code, the voluntary arbitrator is now mandated to render an award or
decision within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of submission of the
dispute and such decision shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar
days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Where the parties agree that the decision of the arbitrator shall
be final and unappealable as in the instant case, the pivotal inquiry is
whether subject arbitration award is indeed beyond the ambit of the court's
power of judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule in the negative.  It is stated explicitly under Art. 2044 of the Civil Code that the
finality of the arbitrators' award is not absolute and without exceptions.  Where the conditions described in Articles
2038, 2039 and 2040 applicable to both compromises and arbitrations are
obtaining, the arbitrators' award may be annulled or rescinded.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Additionally, under Sections 24 and 25 of the Arbitration Law, there are
grounds for vacating, modifying or rescinding an arbitrator's award.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, if and when the factual circumstances referred to in the above-cited
provisions are present, judicial review of the award is properly warranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">What if courts refuse or neglect to inquire into the factual
milieu of an arbitrator's award to determine whether it is in accordance with
law or within the scope of his authority?  How may the power of judicial review be invoked?<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This is where the proper remedy is <i>certiorari</i> under Rule
65 of the Revised Rules of Court.  It is
to be borne in mind, however, that this action will lie only where a grave
abuse of discretion or an act without or in excess of jurisdiction on the part
of the voluntary arbitrator is clearly shown.  For "the writ of <i>certiorari</i> is an extra-ordinary remedy and that
<i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction is not to be equated with appellate
jurisdiction.  In a special civil action
of <i>certiorari</i>, the Court will not engage in a review of the facts found
nor even of the law as interpreted or applied by the arbitrator unless the supposed
errors of fact or of law are so patent and gross and prejudicial as to amount
to a grave abuse of discretion or an <u>exces</u> <u>de</u> <u>pouvoir</u> on
the part of the arbitrator."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even decisions of administrative agencies which are declared
"final" by law are not exempt from judicial review when so
warranted.  Thus, in the case of <u>Oceanic
Bic Division (FFW) et al. v. Flerida Ruth P. Romero, et al</u>.<span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style=""> </span></b>this Court had occasion to rule
that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x x  Inspite of
statutory provisions making 'final' the decisions of certain administrative
agencies, <u>we have taken cognizance </u><u><span style="">of petitions questioning these decisions where </span>want of
jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, violation of due process, denial of
substantial justice or erroneous interpretation of the law</u> were brought to
our attention x x <span style="">x."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>(Under­scoring ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be stressed too, that voluntary arbitrators, by the
nature of their functions, act in a quasi-judicial capacity.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
It stands to reason, therefore, that their decisions should not be beyond the scope
of the power of judicial review of this Court.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioners assailed the arbitral award on
the following grounds, most of which allege error on the part of the arbitrator
in granting compensation for various items which apparently are disputed by
said petitioners:<span style="font-size: 9pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After closely studying the list of errors, as well as
petitioners' discussion of the same in their Motion to Remand Case For Further
Hearing and Reconsideration and Opposition to Motion for Confirmation of Award,
we find that petitioners have amply made out a case where the voluntary
arbitrator failed to apply the terms and provisions of the Construction
Agreement which forms part of the law applicable as between the parties, thus
committing a grave abuse of discretion.  Furthermore, in granting unjustified extra compensation to respondent
for several items, he exceeded his powers -- all of which would have
constituted ground for vacating the award under Section 24 (d) of the
Arbitration Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the respondent trial court's refusal to look into the merits
of the case, despite <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing of the existence of
grounds warranting judicial review, effectively deprived petitioners of their
opportunity to prove or substantiate their allegations.  In so doing, the trial court itself
committed grave abuse of discretion.  Likewise, the appellate court, in not giving due course to the petition,
committed grave abuse of discretion.  Respondent courts should not shirk from exercising their power to
review, where under the applicable laws and jurisprudence, such power may be
rightfully exercised; more so where the objections raised against an
arbitration award may properly constitute grounds for annulling, vacating or
modifying said award under the laws on arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>the petition is GRANTED.  The Reso­lutions of the Court of Appeals
dated October 22, 1990 and December 3, 1990 as well as the Orders of respondent
Regional Trial Court dated July 31, 1990 and August 23, 1990, including the
writ of execution issued pursuant thereto, are hereby SET ASIDE.  Accordingly, this case is REMANDED to the court
of origin for further hearing on this matter.  All incidents arising therefrom are reverted to the <u>status</u> <u>guo</u>
<u>ante</u> until such time as the trial court shall have passed upon the
merits of this case.  No costs.</p>

Section 24.  <u>Grounds for vacating
award</u>. - In any one of the following cases, the court must make an order
vacating the award upon the petition of any party to the controversy when such
party proves affirmatively that in the arbitration proceedings:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">(a) The award was procured by
corruption, fraud, or other undue means; or</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0in;">(b) That there was evident
partiality or corruption in the arbitrators or any of them; or</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">(c) That the
arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon
sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material
to the controversy; that one or more of the arbitrators was disqualified to act
as such under section nine hereof, and wilfully<b> </b>refrained from
disclosing such disqualifications or of any other misbehavior by which the
rights of any party have been materially prejudiced; or</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: 13.5pt;">(d) That the
arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them, that a
mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted to them was
not made.</p>

is vacated, the court, in its discretion, may direct a new hearing either
before the same arbitrators or before a new arbitrator or arbitrators chosen in
the manner provided <span style="">in </span>the
submission or contract for the selection of the original arbitrator or
arbitrators, and any provision limiting the time in which the arbitrators may

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">In any one of the
following cases, the court must make an order modifying or correcting the
award, upon the application of any party to the controversy which was
arbitrated:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">(a) Where there was an evident
miscal­culation of figures, or an evident mistake in the description of any
person, thing or property referred to in the award; or</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">(b) Where the arbitrators have
awarded upon a matter not submitted to them, not affecting the merits of the
decision upon the matter submitted; or</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">(c) Where the award is imperfect
in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy, and if it had
been a commissioner’s report, the defect could have been amended or disregarded
by the court.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.25in;">The order may modify and correct
the award so as to effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the
