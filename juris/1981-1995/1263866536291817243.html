G.R. Nos. L-39386 and L-39620-29, entitled "Florentina Nuguid Vda. de

attention to detail, two reports were submitted which, in order to vividly
portray the scope and magnitude of respondent's operations and how he was able

<p class="BODY">I. <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The antecedent facts on
which Administrative Case No. 2148 is premised are reported by then Solicitor
General Estelito P. Mendoza, as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>PREFATORY</u> <u>STATEMENT</u></p>

<blockquote>This unnumbered administrative case against respondent Atty. Felipe
C. Navarro (hereinafter called respondent NAVARRO, for short) originally
stemmed from the letter of a certain Angelito B. Cayanan to the Honorable
Supreme Court dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1975</st1:date>
which reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align:center;text-indent:-.45pt" align="center">x x x</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"I wish to respectfully inform your
good office that I bought a few lots on installment basis from Atty. Felipe C.
Navarro of Ruby Hills Subdivision as evidenced by the attached OR Nos. 0512 and
0519 and a ‘Contract of Sale'.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Atty. Navarro, some officials and
representative of the said company claim that although there is a pending case
No. L-39386 under Decree No. 1425 on the property being sold, the case is
almost won in their favor and are just waiting for your final decision within a
couple of months or even less.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"In this connection, I am
respectfully writing you this letter in order to bring to your attention this
transaction and to protect my rights in the event that any unfavorable
circumstances may arise in the future."</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Acting on the aforesaid letter, the Supreme Court, per Resolution
dated February 14, 1975, referred the copy of Mr. Cayanan's letter to the
Solicitor General for "investigation of the existence of sufficient ground
to proceed with the prosecution of Atty. Felipe C. Navarro (whose address<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of record is No. 66 Azucena, Roxas
District, Quezon City) for suspension or removal from the office of attorney
and for appropriate action".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
resolution reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"L-39386 and L-39620-29 (Florentina
Nuguid Vda. de Haberer vs. Court of Appeals, et al.). - The court NOTED the
letter dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1975</st1:date>
of Mr. Angelito B. Cayanan with its attachments (copy thereof has been
furnished Atty. Felipe C. Navarro, counsel for respondents) and RESOLVED to
instruct the Clerk of Court to inform him of the status of the cases at bar.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"It appearing from said letter that
Atty. Felipe C. Navarro has been selling the lots in litigation herein on
installment basis to the public (among them, Mr. Cayanan) as ‘absolute owner by
virtue of his contract of legal services in Civil Case No. 8321, etc. of the
Court of First Instance of Rizal, Pasig’ (see Ruby Hills Subdivision Contract
of Sale), which lots are titled in the name of herein petitioner and not in
Atty. Navarro's name and that the unwarranted claim is made on his behalf that
‘the case is almost won in their favor’ (see Mr. Cayanan’s letter), the Court
RESOLVED FURTHER to refer copy of Mr. Cayanan's said letter with its
attachments to the Solicitor General under Rule 139, Sections 1,3,4 and 5 for
investigation of the existence of sufficient ground to proceed with the
prosecution of Atty. Felipe C. Navarro (whose address of record is No. 66
Azucena, Roxas District, Quezon City) for suspension or removal from the office
of attorney and for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Aside from Mr. Cayanan, the
Solicitor General is directed to communicate in the premises with Atty. Eulogio
R. Rodriguez of the law firm of Ortigas &amp; Ortigas (with address at 10th
Floor, Ortigas Bldg. Ortigas Ave., Pasig, Rizal), who under letter of June 10,
1974 on file in Administrative Case No. 1154 has offered to make available documents
in their possession showing other sales made by Atty. Navarro of properties
titled in the name of other persons, involving a total selling price of P75
million and down payments of almost P0.6 million."</p>

<blockquote>On April 4, 1975, Assistant Solicitor General (now Justice of the
Court of Appeals) Hugo E. Gutierrez, Jr. wrote Mr. Angelito B. Cayanan asking
him to submit his affidavit embodying the circumstances surrounding the matters
contained in his letter dated January 25, 1975, especially the second paragraph
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letter was sent to Mr.
Cayanan by registered mail but the same was returned unserved for the reason
that the addressee had moved to another address.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the same date, <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="4">April 4,
 1975</st1:date>, Assistant Solicitor General Gutierrez, Jr. also wrote to Atty.
Eulogio R. Rodriguez requesting him for copies of the documents evidencing the
sales made by respondent Navarro.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On February 13, 1976, this Honorable Court issued a Resolution in
L-39386 and L-39620-29 (Florentina Nuguid Vda. de Haberer vs. Court of Appeals,
et al.) referring the letter of Atty. Francisco Ortigas, Jr. dated January 13,
1976 "for investigation of the existence of sufficient grounds for the
prosecution of Atty. Felipe C. Navarro for suspension or removal from office
and for appropriate action" and directing "Mr. Ortigas, Jr., to
furnish the Office of the Solicitor General for the purpose with a copy of said
letter and all its pertinent attachments".</blockquote>

<blockquote>The aforementioned letter of Atty. Francisco Ortigas, Jr. dated <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1976</st1:date> reads as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align:center;text-indent:-.45pt" align="center">x x x</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:-.45pt">“Dear Justice Teehankee,</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"This is to apprise your Office of
the latest activities of Atty. Felipe C. Navarro who has previously been
reported to the Supreme Court as selling properties titled in the name of this
Company.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"We have just secured a new
‘subdivision plan’ of Atty. Navarro showing that the lots he is now selling to
the public include those titled in the names of the heirs of the late Don
Vicente Madrigal and this Company in Quezon City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Navarro has thus expanded his
activities despite recent detention by the Military.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As could be seen from the attached ‘plan',
Navarro claims to be the owner of that huge property (actually titled in the
name of the Madrigals and this Company) bounded by Ortigas Avenue, E. <st1:address><st1:street>delos
  Santos Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city>White Plains</st1:city></st1:address>
Road and <st1:street><st1:address>E. Rodriguez Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>,
comprising approximately of 260 hectares.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"As reported in our previous letters
to the Court, Navarro claims to be the owner of some 4,000 hectares of land in
the Greater Manila Area in virtue of his handling the case of some squatters on
a 1.2-hectare lot Mandaluyong, Rizal owned by Dona Florentina Nuguid Vda. de
Haberer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He contends that whereas his
squatters-clients occupy only about a hectare, he has become, in virtue of his
‘contract of legal services’ with them, the owner of thousands of hectares of
land as these are allegedly covered by void titles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Navarro thus started to openly sell these
properties.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Navarro's Ruby Hills and Bluehills
Subdivisions, for instance, cover properties already with buildings, and other
improvements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has nevertheless been
quite successful in selling portions thereof, as when he sold lots within the
De La Salle College, Wack-Wack Golf &amp; Country Club, <st1:place><st1:placename>ABM</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Sison</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His <u>modus</u> <u>operandi</u> is
described in this Company's letter-complaint dated <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1974</st1:date> to Gen. Prospero Olivas, copy of which is
attached hereto for ready reference.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Navarro continues to defy the
authorities, for only after a brief lull, he is now again openly selling titled
properties of other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have
provided more than sufficient documentary evidence to the Court and the
Solicitor General and we hope that formal administrative charges can now be
filed against Navarro to prevent him from further perpetrating a large-scale
fraud upon the public."</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, hearings were conducted on various dates.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>COMPLAINANTS'</u> <u>EVIDENCE</u></p>

<blockquote>The evidence for the complainants consist mainly of documents, most
of which were presented in Criminal Cases Nos. 3158 and 3159 of the Court of
First Instance of Rizal and in the various civil cases before the said court
involving Florentina Nuguid Vda. de Haberer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainants' sole witness, Reynaldo Morallos, merely identified the
various documentary exhibits presented by the complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the evidence adduced by the complainants, it appears that a
certain Florentina Nuguid Vda. de Haberer (hereinafter called HABERER, for
short) filed in the Court of First Instance of Rizal twenty-two (22) cases for
recovery of possession of her 1.2 hectare property in Mandaluyong, Rizal titled
in her name, and to eject the twenty-two (22) families squatting thereat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Eleven (11) of these cases were raffled to
Judge Emilio Salas, while the other eleven (11) cases were assigned to Judge
Pedro Navarro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All the twenty-two (22)
defendants-squatters were represented by respondent NAVARRO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On behalf of his clients, respondent NAVARRO
interposed as principal defense, the alleged nullity of the HABERER'S title,
claiming that the mother title from which it emanated actually originated from
Decree No. 1425 issued in G.L.R.O.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Record No. 917, which he claims to be non-existent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The two sets of cases were decided differently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first set of eleven (11) cases, Judge
Salas rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1970</st1:date> sustaining the validity of the HABERER'S title and
ordering the eviction of the defendants?squatters clients of respondent
NAVARRO (Exhibit W).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In finding for the
plaintiff, Judge Salas stated as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"After due consideration of the
evidence adduced by both parties, this Court finds that most of the documentary
evidence submitted by defendants are irrelevant to the case since they pertain
to defendants claim of ownership over 10,000 hectares of land when the area of
the property subject matter of the complaint is only 12,700 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court also believes that the
above-mentioned claims of defendants are untenable.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Plaintiff's ownership over the
property in question is evidenced by the issuance in her name, since 1929, of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15043.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is a settled rule in this jurisdiction that a certificate of title
serves as evidence of an indefeasible title to the property in favor of the
person whose name appears therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the expiration of the one-year period from the issuance of the decree of
registration upon which it is based, it becomes incontrovertible (see case of
Pamintuan vs. San Agustin, 43 Phil. 558; Reyes &amp; Nadres vs. Borbon &amp;
Director of Lands, 50 Phil. 791; Manuel Sy Juco, et al. vs. Luis Francisco, 53
O.G., p. 2186, April 15, 1957; Brizuela, et al. vs. Ciriaco Vda. de Vargas, 53
O.G., 2822, May 15, 1957).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Defendants' claim that they became
owners of the land in question by adverse possession is without merit
considering that title to land becomes non-prescriptible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 42 of Act No. 496 provides that no title
to registered land in derogation to that of the registered owner shall be
acquired by prescription or adverse possession (Corporacion de Pp. Agustines
vs. Crisostomo, 42 Phil. 427).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A title
once registered cannot be defeated even by adverse, open and notorious
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Registered title under the
Torrens System cannot be defeated by prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title, once registered, is notice to the
World.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All persons must take
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No one can plead ignorance of
registration (Legarda vs. Saleeby, 3 Phil. 590, 595).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Further, defendants recognized
plaintiff's ownership over the property in question when they filed a petition
with the People's Homesite &amp; Housing Corporation wherein they sought the
latter's intervention for the acquisition of the property and for the
subdividing thereof into small lots to be sold to them at nominal cost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said petition defendants not only named
the plaintiff as the owner of the property in question but they also indicated
therein her title to the land as Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15043 of the
Register of Deeds of Pasig, Rizal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
quote hereunder the pertinent facts and data concerning the property in
question in defendants' petition submitted to the General Manager of the
People's Homesite &amp; Housing Corporation, as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"As regards defendants' claim that
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15043 issued since 1929 in the name of
plaintiff is null and void, this Court is of the opinion that defendants cannot
assail the validity of said title in this proceeding, which is for recovery of
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any attack on the decree of
registration of title must be direct and not by collateral proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title which may be issued in pursuance of
said decree cannot be changed, altered, modified, enlarged or diminished in a
collateral proceeding (Legarda, et al. vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil. 590). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In the case of Director of Land vs. Gan Tan,
G.R. No. L-2664, May 30, 1951, our Supreme Court, in reversing the decision of
the trial court where the registered owner was considered disqualified to
acquire land under the Constitution and consequently was denied the right to
constitute his title, said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘That the
disqualification raised by the Court is untenable in the light of the theory
that a Torrens title cannot be collaterally attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That issue can only be raised in an action
instituted expressly for that purpose.’ ‘(See also Ramon Chua Yu Sun, vs. The

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"In view of the above-mentioned
ruling of the Supreme Court, it is our opinion that there is no need to discuss

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"The Court has read copy of this
decision of our Branch XV and observed findings of facts too ponderous to be
ignored.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"That case before Branch XV directly
assails the nullity of the proceedings leading to the proceedings in GLRO
Record No. 917 and, as an inevitable corollary, the nullity of Decree No. 1425
issued by virtue of such void proceedings as well as the original certificates
of title issued as consequence thereof.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"In said proceeding before Branch XV
the Court, among other things, found that while the decision in GLRO 917 was
supposedly rendered on <st1:date year="1905" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1905</st1:date>,
the survey of the property subject matter of therein application was not made
until June 16 to <st1:date year="1906" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1906</st1:date>,
or some one year after the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
found no proof of initial hearing of the application for registration being
published as required by law without which the <st1:street><st1:address>Land
  Registration Court</st1:address></st1:street> could not have acquired
jurisdiction over the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
decision also made inference that since the survey of the property was not made
until a year after the rendition of the judgment the technical descriptions
appearing in the original certificates of title issued under GLRO Rec. No. 917
Decree No. 1425, could not have been those appearing in the notice of initial
hearing, if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Publication of accurate
technical description being an essential jurisdictional requirement which
cannot be dispensed with and non-compliance with this requirement renders the
proceedings and the decision and decree and titles issued arising therefrom
null and void.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"The same decision of Branch XV also
made its findings that James Ross who was said to have penned the decision in
GLRO Rec. No. 917, never was a judge of the Court of Land Registration at the
time the decision was supposedly rendered because the Gaceta Oficial for the
year 1905 does not show that James Ross was listed as Judge of the Land
Registration Court or that he was ever appointed in that capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Court found that while J. C.
Welson was the Clerk of Court on <st1:date year="1905" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1905</st1:date>, one A. K. Jones issued the decree and he signed it as
Clerk of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court even found the
supposed decision in that proceedings missing and made its conclusion that since
the decree which was supposedly issued by a person who was not the Clerk of
Court at the time and which decree did not contain the description of the
property ordered in the decision to be rendered because the survey of the
property was only made some one year later and that said decree cannot now even
be found, the decision rendered therein is void for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Now, as we have said, the foregoing
findings of facts are too ponderous to be ignored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed a truism that a void original
certificate of title cannot be the source of a valid transfer certificate of
title and a void judgment is, in the eyes of the law, inexistent and cannot
give source to any legal right.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"The evidence now shows that the
plaintiffs in said Civil Case No. 7-M(10339) before Branch XV of this Court are
also the defendants in the herein eleven cases in which their properties, are
also involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the case before
Branch XV directly assails the nullity of the proceedings by virtue of which
Decree No. 1425 and the alleged title of the plaintiff over the parcels of land
occupied by the herein eleven defendants is a derivative from such decree, it
is the considered opinion of this Court that until and unless the decision of
Branch XV of this Court is reversed or set aside by final judgment, plaintiff's
prayer to order the herein eleven defendants in these eleven cases to vacate
the parcels which they occupy and on which their respective houses are built
has become premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It goes without
saying that if said decision of Branch XV will be finally affirmed, or that the
same becomes final and executory, all the claims of rights to ownership and
possession of properties embraced in the decision in GLRO Rec. No. 917 and
Decree No. 1425 shall become absolute nullities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Possessions by actual occupants of all these

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"In the order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1971</st1:date>, the Court had occasion
to reiterate that its decision in this case was mainly predicated on the
decision of Branch XV of this Court that the certificate of title emanating
from the proceedings in GLRO Record No. 917 were null and void and plaintiff's
title happened to be one of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court opined that until said decision is reversed the actual occupants had
better be maintained in their possessions of the land.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"Pursuant to the same order the
motion for reconsideration and new trial was set only for reception of alleged
newly discovered evidence.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"The Court now understands that the
decision of Branch XV is now under review by order of our Appellate Court.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">It has also come to the understanding of
the Court that the order of June 21, 1971, sought to be reconsidered insofar as
it ordered the cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15043 in favor
of the plaintiff, also adversely affects the interests of other persons and
entities like the Ortigas and Company, Limited Partnership, which- is not a
party herein, because the certificate of title of the plaintiff is also a
derivative of GLRO 917 and Decree No. 1425 from which Ortigas &amp; Company,
Limited Partnership, derives titles over wide tracts of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Ortigas &amp; Company, Limited
Partnership, is not a party in this case whatever orders or decisions are made
in this case cannot be made to affect the said company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Decisions and orders can only affect parties to
the case.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-right:.3in">"The Court therefore arrives at the
conclusion that the order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1971</st1:date>, must be reconsidered on two grounds (1) because the
decision of Branch XV is now being the subject of further proceedings and (2)
because it has the effect of adversely affecting the interest of Ortigas &amp;
Company, Limited Partnership, which is not even a party herein.</p>

dated <st1:date year="1971" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1971</st1:date>, is set

impracticability of creating what Manresa calls a state of `forced
co-ownership' (Vol. 3, 4th ed., p. 213), the law has provided a just and
equitable solution by giving the owner of the land the option to acquire the
improvements after the payment of the proper indemnity or to oblige the builder
or planter to pay for the land and the sower to pay the proper rent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the owner of the land who is allowed to
exercise the option because his right is older and because, by the principle of

he has sold, and is still selling, properties covered by Torrens titles in the

of said parties are null and void because they emanated from Decree No. 1425;
that he has no title over the properties sold by him except the contract of
legal services which his clients allegedly signed; that he has no approved
plans for the various subdivisions allegedly owned by him; that he has not
obtained any certificate of registration or license to sell from the National
Housing Authority; that he has not declared for taxation purposes the thousands
of hectares of prime lands in Mandaluyong, San Juan, Pasig, Quezon City and

Virginia B. Geeslin vs. Leopoldo Cojuangco, et al.':<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) declaring the transfer of the lot to

the case and its docket number for the obvious and malicious reason that the
case he relies upon (Heirs of Nuguid vs. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 42699-­42709)
is still pending resolution before the Supreme Court and hence cannot be `final

</span>Further, that title thereto having described the land to be part of the
Municipality of San Juan del Monte, is void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He cannot disclaim knowledge however of the fact that the area in the
vicinity of Santolan Road in Quezon City was originally part of the
Municipality of San Juan del Monte territory of Quezon City when the latter was
created on 14 June 1950.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of

disregard for basic norms of honesty and decency in that having prejudiced the
interest of his clients because of his gross neglect to appeal in a timely

complete ignorance of the law, he had influenced his clients into commencing a
case before the Tanod Bayan against the Presiding Judge of the City Court of
Quezon City, Branch I, and Hon. Minerva Genovea.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case is obviously calculated to harrass

which their respective houses are built has become premature." This
condition was reiterated in Judge Navarro's order of September 15, 1972 wherein
he stated that:</p>

<blockquote>In the order dated July 17, 1971, the Court had occasion to
reiterate that its decision in this case was mainly predicated on the decision
of Branch XV of this Court that the certificate of title emanating from the
proceedings in GLRO Record No. 917 were null and void and plaintiff's title
happened to be one of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
opined that until said decision is reversed the actual occupants had better be
maintained in their possessions of the land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, to repeat, the March 31, 1970 decision of Branch XV was
set aside by the Court of Appeals which remanded the case for new trial and
another one was rendered, this time by a different judge on November 3, 1973
upholding the validity of Decree No. 1425 and all titles issued as a
consequence thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent cannot
feign ignorance of the November 3, 1973 decision, which superseded the March
31, 1970 decision, for the simple reason that it was his clients who appealed
the former decision to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In spite thereof and indicative of his bad faith, he stubbornly
continues to invoke the decision of March 31,1970 as the source of his alleged
ownership rights over the Ortigas properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span> In the order of June
21, 1971, Judge Pedro Navarro of Branch II ordered the cancellation of Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 15043 issued in the name of Haberer and the issuance
of new titles in the name of the defendants, subject to the lien for attorney's
fees in favor of respondent pursuant to the terms of the contract for his legal
services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the same judge issued
an amendatory order dated <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1972</st1:date>, which provides in part that:</p>

<blockquote>It has also come to the understanding of the Court that the order
of June 21, 1971, sought to be reconsidered insofar as it ordered the
cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title No.15043 in favor of the
plaintiff, also adversely affects the interests of other persons and entities
like the Ortigas and Company, Limited Partnership, which is not a party herein,
because the certificate of title of the plaintiff is also a derivative of GLRO
917 and Decree No. 1425 from which Ortigas &amp; Company, Limited Partnership,
derives titles over wide tracts of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since Ortigas &amp; Company, Limited Partnership, is not a party in this
case whatever orders of decisions are made in this case <u>cannot</u> be made
to affect the said company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Decisions
and orders can only affect parties to the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court therefore arrives at the conclusion that the order dated
June 21, 1971, must be reconsidered on two grounds (1) because the decision of
Branch XV is now being the subject of further proceedings and (2) because it
has the effect of adversely affecting the interest of Ortigas &amp; Company,
Limited Partnership, which is not even a party herein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, as prayed, the order dated June 21, 1971, is <u>set</u> <u>aside</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the decision dated May 26, 1971,
insofar as it denies the ejectment of the present occupants of the land as
stated in the decision stands." (Emphasis supplied)<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is apparent, therefore, that since the order of June 21, 1971,
was set aside, the inescapable conclusion is that Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 15043 stands and remains in the name of Florentina Nuguid. Vda. de
Haberer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the defendants
therein never acquired title to the property covered by the title of
Haberer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, since respondent Navarro
merely derives his supposed title to the properties as a mere transferee, with
more reason can he not validly become the owner of the above properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
intransigently relies on his contract for legal services executed with his
clients, the defendants in the Haberer case, as another basis of his claim of
ownership over the entire property covered by Decree No. 1425.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the said contract was
executed pursuant to the ejectment cases filed against respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Navarro's clients which involve only the
property covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15043 containing an
aggregate area of 12,700 square meters, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the defendants assigned
rights to respondent Navarro over properties which they did not actually occupy
and which virtually extended to all the properties covered by titles issued
under Decree No. 1425.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly
observed by the Solicitor General, said defendants have not presented any
document evidencing their ownership of the parcels of land they assigned to
their lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing considerations, it is incontrovertible that
respondent's pretended ownership rights over the parcels of land covered by
Decree No. 1425 have no bases whatsoever, either in fact or in law, and it is
an assault on credulity to assume that he was not aware of the vacuity of his
pretensions and misrepresentations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving this disbarment case, we must perforce initially
focus on the degree of integrity and respectability required and expected of
the law profession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no denying
that membership in the legal profession is achieved only after a long and laborious
study.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By years of patience, zeal and
ability the attorney acquires a fixed means of support for himself and his
family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say, however,
that the emphasis is on the pecuniary value of this profession but rather on
the social prestige and intellectual standing necessarily arising from and
attached to the same by reason of the fact that everyone is deemed an officer
of the court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The importance of the dual aspects of the legal profession has
been judiciously stated by Chief Justice Marshall of the United States Supreme
Court in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>On one hand, the profession of an Atty. is of great importance to
an individual and the prosperity of his life may depend on its exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to exercise it ought not to be
lightly or capriciously taken from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, it is extremely desirable that the respectability of
the Bar should be maintained and that its harmony with the bench should be
preserved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For these objects, some
controlling power, some discretion, ought to be exercised with great moderation
and judgment, but it must be exercised.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a number of cases, we have repeatedly explained and stressed
that the purpose of disbarment is not meant as a punishment to deprive an
attorney of a means of livelihood but is rather intended to protect the courts
and the public from the misconduct of the officers of the court and to ensure
the proper administration of justice by requiring that those who exercise this
important function shall be competent, honorable and trustworthy men in whom
courts and clients may repose confidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Its objectives are to compel the lawyer to deal fairly and honestly with his
client and to remove from the profession a person whose misconduct has proven
him unfit for the duties and responsibilities belonging to the office of an
attorney.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a rule, an attorney enjoys the legal presumption that he is
innocent of the charges until the contrary is proved, and that, as an officer
of the court, he has performed his duty in accordance with his oath.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Therefore, in disbarment proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the
complainant,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
and for the court to exercise its disciplinary powers, the case against the
respondent must be established by clear, convincing and satisfactory proof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have painstakingly scrutinized and evaluated the records of these
two administrative cases and we cannot but find that strong and unassailable
evidence exist to render it our irremissible duty to impose the ultimate
sanction of disbarment on respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent's defense is anchored primarily on the contract for legal
services, executed by his clients whom he represented in the twenty-two
ejectment cases filed before Branches I and II of the former Court of First
Instance of Rizal, and quoted in full in the earlier part of this discussion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is extremely relevant to note that both of the aforesaid two
branches of the trial court made no finding as to the validity of the claim of
ownership favorable to the defendants therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, Judge Salas of Branch I found for the plaintiff and
ordered the defendants, clients of respondent, to vacate the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case before Judge Navarro of Branch II, the complaint was
dismissed merely on the ground that "since the evidence is uncontroverted
that the defendants in all these eleven cases have been in open, continuous,
and adverse possession of their respective parcels dating back since their
predecessors in interest, their possession must be maintained and
respected."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on June 21, 1971, the aforesaid judgment of dismissal
dated May 26, 1971 was modified, and the Register of Deeds was thereafter
ordered to cancel the transfer certificate of title issued in favor of
plaintiff and to issue new titles in the name of defendants subject to the lien
for attorney's fees in favor of herein respondent in accordance with the
contract for legal services hereinbefore discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eventually, however, this subsequent order was reconsidered and
set aside in the order of September 15, 1972, "because it has the effect
of adversely affecting the interest of Ortigas &amp; Co., Ltd. Partnership,
which is not even a party herein," but it reinstated the decision of May
26, 1971 insofar as it denied the ejectment of the present occupants.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, there is nothing in the records to show that
the defendants in the ejectment cases were declared the true owners of the land
subject of said cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the fact of
possession was ruled upon, and what the courts recognized was merely the
defendants' right of possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They,
therefore, never became the owners of the subject lots in any sense of the word
in the absence of any declaration to that effect, by reason of which they could
not have legally transmitted any ownership rights or interests to herein
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, we have seen
that any further claim of ownership on their part was finally settled by the
order of September 15, 1972, setting aside the order of June 21, 1971, wherein
the trial court correctly held that the earlier order unjustifiedly affected
adversely the rights of Ortigas &amp; Company, Limited Partnership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, said court specifically excluded
the title of said partnership from the effects of its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the provisions of the contract of legal services, the
defendants-clients agreed to convey to respondent whatever properties may be
adjudicated in their favor in the event of their failure to pay the attorney's
fees agreed upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As hereinbefore
stated, there was nothing awarded to the said defendants except the right to
possess for the nonce the lots they were occupying, nothing more.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That respondent acquired no better right than
the defendants from whom he supposedly derived his claim is further confirmed
in the order of Judge Navarro, dated June 21, 1971, denying the issuance of new
certificates of title to herein respondent who, to further stress the obvious,
was not even a party but only a lawyer of the defendants therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows that his act of selling the
Ortigas properties is patently and indisputably illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent admits that he has no Torrens title but insists on the
puerile theory that his title is his contract of legal services.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering that the effectivity of the provisions of that contract is squarely
premised on the award of said properties to the therein defendants, and since
there was no such adjudication, respondent's pretense is unmasked as an
unmitigated deception.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it
will be recalled that the land involved in the two ejectment cases consists of
only 1.2 hectares whereas respondent is claiming ownership over thousands of
hectares of land, the sheer absurdity of which he could not be unaware.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent further admits that he has been and is continuously
selling, up to the present, the entirety of the land covered by Decree No.
1425,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
pursuant to the decision of Branch XV of the then Court of First Instance of
Rizal, dated March 31, 1970, declaring the said decree null and void as well as
the titles derived therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must nonetheless be remembered that the decision of Judge
Navarro recognizing the defendants' right of possession is subject to the final
outcome of the March 31, 1970 decision of Branch XV which nullified Decree No.
1425.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter decision, at the time
the decision of Judge Navarro was rendered, was pending appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the reason why Judge
Navarro had to amend his decision a third time by setting aside the order of
registration of the land in the name of the defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could not properly rule on the ownership
rights of defendants therein pending a final determination of the validity of
said decree, which thus prompted him to find merely on the fact of
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, a mere declaration
of nullity cannot, <u>per</u> <u>se</u>, justify the performance of any act of
ownership over lands titled in the name of other persons pursuant to said
decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To cap it all, as earlier
discussed, that decision dated March 31, 1970 has been reversed and set aside,
and a new one entered confirming the validity of Decree No. 1425, which latter
decision has long become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Civil Case No. Q-16265, entitled "Ortigas and Co., Ltd.
Partnership vs. Navarro," herein respondent was enjoined from selling,
offering for sale and advertising properties of the plaintiff therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have seen that a decision was subsequently
rendered therein on December 16, 1972 by Branch XVI of the Court of First
Instance of Rizal upholding the validity of the transfer certificates of title
issued in the name of Ortigas and Co., Limited Partnership which became final
and executory after respondent's petition for review was denied by this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, respondent continued to
sell properties belonging to Ortigas in blatant disregard of said
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was categorically
admitted by respondent himself during the investigation conducted, by the
Solicitor General.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent avers that the said decision cannot be enforced during
the pendency of the appeal therefrom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even if this were true, the fact that respondent was enjoined by the
court from selling portions of the Ortigas properties is compelling reason
enough for him to desist from continuing with his illegal transactions.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>Respondent Navarro knew that the decision of Judge Vivencio Ruiz
declaring as null and void certificates of titles emanating from Decree No.
1425 was reversed and set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He knew
that Judge Pedro Navarro of the Rizal Court of First Instance exempted Ortigas
&amp; Company from the effects of his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also knew that Judge Sergio Apostol of the Rizal Court of First
Instance in Quezon City had upheld the validity of the certificates of title of
Ortigas &amp; Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite all these
pronouncements and his awareness thereof, respondent NAVARRO still continued to
sell properties titled in the name of Ortigas &amp; Company and the Madrigals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the motion to dismiss filed by respondent, should be, as
it is hereby, denied for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent inexplicably posits that the charges against him should be
dismissed on the ground that his suspension was automatically lifted by virtue
of our resolution, dated <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1980</st1:date>,
which merely reads:</p>

<blockquote>The manifestation of counsel for respondent stating among other
things that the complaint against respondent could not prosper if respondent's
manifestation dated March 3, 1980 in G.R. No. 42699-42709 and his request for
certification by the Chief Justice to the effect that the petition in G.R. Nos.
42699-42709 is deemed dismissed pursuant to Sec. 11(2) of Art. X of the
Constitution are granted, are NOTED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is absolutely nothing in the resolution to support
respondent's typical distortion of facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, our resolutions dated September 2, 1980, November 8,
1980, and January 22, 1981 repeatedly denied respondent's motions for the
lifting of his suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">It further bears mention at this juncture that despite the suspension
of respondent Navarro from the practice of law, he continues to do so in clear
violation and open defiance of the original resolution of suspension and the
aforestated resolutions reiterating and maintaining the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the records of this Court disclose that
in G.R. No. 78103, entitled "Jose de Leon, et al. vs. Court of Appeals, et
al.," a Second Division case filed on April 25, 1987, counsel for private
respondents therein questioned herein respondent Navarro's personality to intervene
in the case since he was under suspension, to which respondent Navarro rejoined
by insisting that his suspension had allegedly been lifted already.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 85973, entitled "Hilario
Abalos vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,” the petition wherein was filed on December
2, 1988 and assigned to the First Division, respondent Navarro also appeared as
counsel for therein petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
petition was denied since the same was prepared, signed and-verified by
respondent Navarro, a suspended member of the Philippine Bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Over his expostulation that his suspension
had already been lifted, the Court directed the Bar Confidant to take
appropriate action to enforce the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Again, in G.R. No. 90873, entitled "Matilde Cabugwang, et al. vs.
Court of Appeals, et al.," the Second Division, in a resolution dated
January 31, 1990, imposed a fine of P1,000.00 upon said respondent for
appearing therein as counsel for petitioner which fine he paid on February 5,
1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">In at least three (3) other cases in the Second Division, respondent
Navarro appeared before the Court as counsel for petitioners therein, viz:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) G.R. No. 74792 (Lorenzo Valdez, et al.
vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.), filed on June 11, 1986 and decided
on December 7, 1986; (2) G.R. No. 76589 (Atty. Felipe C. Navarro, et al. vs.
Court of Appeals, et al.), filed on November 28, 1986 and decided on May 4,
1987; and (3) G.R. No. 81482 (Ricardo Rasalan vs. Flaviano Pascua, et al.),
filed on January 30, 1988 and decided on February 15, 1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rollos in said cases show that he also
appeared as counsel for the petitioners in the Court of Appeals, but since the
lower courts' original records were not forwarded to this Court, said rollos do
not reflect whether he also appeared before the different courts <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such acts of respondent are evidential of flouting resistance to
lawful orders of constituted authority and illustrate his incorrigible
despiciency for an attorney's duty to society.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Verily, respondent has proven himself unworthy of the trust and
confidence reposed in him by law and by this Court, through his deliberate
rejection of his oath as an officer of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, respondent Felipe C. Navarro is hereby
DISBARRED and his name is ordered STRICKEN from the Roll of Attorneys.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this resolution be furnished to
the Bar Confidant and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and spread on the
personal records of respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
