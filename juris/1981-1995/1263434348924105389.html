<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">It was about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon of January 22, 1988,
when Pablo Partosa was on his way to his farm that he noticed
accused-appellants Apolinario “Dodoy” Sarense and Wilfredo “Willy” Sarense,
father and son respectively, standing at the roadside both with 31-inch long
bolos tied to their respective waists.  Upon reaching his farm which is about fifteen (15) meters away from
where the appellants were standing, he began weeding off the grass.  After about four minutes, he stretched his
back to relax a little and it was at this moment that he saw Antonio Cafino
carrying his air gun on his shoulder at the place where appellants were
standing.  Partosa then saw Dodoy hack
Antonio with a bolo on the left wrist.  Willy, who was standing behind Antonio followed suit by hacking the
latter at the back, below the right shoulder.  It was at this point that Antonio fell and rolled to the ground but
appellants continued attacking him by<span style="font-size:11.0pt"> </span>taking
turns in hacking Antonio.  Noticing
Antonio to be motionless, appellants ran away carrying with them Antonio's air
gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pablo Partosa ran towards the house of Antonio where he was met
by the latter's daughter, Imelda.  He
informed her of what happened and they went to where Antonio was.  Upon reaching the scene of the crime, they
found Antonio Cafino beyond recognition, dead and bathed with his own blood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dead body of Antonio was brought to their house and was
examined<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
by Dr. Jocelyn Elnar the following day at the municipal hall.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Apolinario “Dodoy” Sarense claims self-defense
while accused-appellant Wilfredo “Willy” Sarense denies participation in the
killing of Antonio Cafino.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having admitted the killing, the burden of proof is on the
accused that he did so in self-defense by clear and convincing evidence that
excludes any vestige of criminal aggression on his part, otherwise conviction
would follow.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused must rely on the strength of his own evidence, and not on the weakness
of that of the prosecution, for even if it were weak, it could not be
disbelieved after the accused admitted the killing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apolinario Sarense alias “Dodoy” claims that when he met Antonio
Cafino, the latter fired at him four times with an air gun, but strangely
enough, not one of the discharged pellets hit him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> The
fourth shot was fired so close to him but Antonio allegedly missed, thereupon
the latter pulled out his bolo and delivered a hacking blow on Apolinario.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Then ensued a duel between them in the course of which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">said </span>accused fell to the ground after his foot got caught with a
vine.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
And even when said accused was down Antonio kept on delivering hacking blows at
him but which failed to find their mark as they were successfully parried by
the accused.  Meanwhile, the accused was
able to pull out his scythe with his left hand which he used in fighting back
and hitting Antonio<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
nine (9) times inflicting on the latter serious wounds that caused his death.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the account of Dodoy Sarense, We are made to believe that
Antonio Cafino was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">so </span>inept and
clumsy as a fighter that from a distance of around 10 meters not only did he
fail to hit said accused with any one of his four shots but in spite of several
hacking blows of his bolo he was only able to hit Dodoy twice and only while
said accused was still standing and facing Antonio.  Dodoy's story is hard to believe.  He did not even seek cover when the deceased <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">was </span>allegedly firing at him.  Such is not the ordinary and logical
reaction of a man faced with a threat to his life.</p>

<p class="BODY">The tale given by accused Dodoy is not only unbelievable but
incredible given the positions in which he and the victim Antonio found
themselves during the incident.  The
Court cannot believe that despite the decidedly advantageous position of
Antonio he was able to inflict <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">only </span>two
slight physical injuries on Dodoy which required seven (7) days of medical
attendance (Exhibit 1), while Dodoy, who was clearly in disadvantageous
position, was yet able to inflict seven (7) hacking wounds and two (2)
lacerated wounds on Antonio, five of which were fatal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Unlawful aggression by the deceased Antonio Cafino was,
therefore, never convincingly established by the evidence offered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>the accused Apolinario “Dodoy”
Sarense.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For self-defense to prosper, it must be positively shown that
there was a previous unlawful and unprovoked attack that placed the defendant's
life in danger and forced him to inflict more or less severe wounds upon his
assailant employing therefore reasonable means to resist the said attack.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's claim of self-defense is belied and negated by the
number of wounds on the body of the deceased and their location as shown in the
autopsy report.  Such wounds are
indicative of aggression and confirms the theory of the prosecution that
accused assaulted the deceased.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since unlawful aggression was not proven by the evidence, the
claim of self-defense by accused Apolinario Sarense cannot be accepted and must
necessarily fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether the deceased Antonio Cafino had a bolo with him on
the day of the incident in question, defense witness Silverio Parao testified,
among other things, that when he and Antonio Cafino were walking together until
they separated ways, Antonio was not carrying a bolo with him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Such testimony of Parao finds corroboration in the fact that although accused
Apolinario Sarense delivered Antonio Cafino's air gun to the police, he never
surrendered any bolo belonging to Antonio Cafino.  His explanation for such failure that his two hands were full
holding his bolo and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">air </span>gun<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
is a lame and flimsy excuse, contrary to ordinary human experience.  One more bolo would not have presented a
difficulty to Apolinario Sarense since, he was able, according to him, to
return his bolo to its scabbard while walking away from the scene of the
crime.  He could have ordered his son
Wilfredo to bring along with him Antonio's bolo, if there was one.  This only shows that Antonio Cafino could
not have probably inflicted the injuries sustained by accused Apolinario
Sarense nor wage an aggression against him for which he had to defend himself.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As for accused-appellant Wilfredo Sarense, he denied having
harmed, or participated in the assault on Antonio Cafino.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
However, witnesses Pablo Partosa and Jacinto Cafino categorically declared
seeing Wilfredo hack Antonio Cafino and when the latter fell to the ground both
Apolinario Sarense and Wilfredo Sarense continued hacking the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bare denial by Wilfredo cannot prevail over the positive evidence
of the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> His
denial, bare as it is, was not corroborated even by his father,
Apolinario.  There is therefore, no
reason to exclude him from responsibility for the death of Antonio Cafino.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The crime charged against the accused is Murder by reason of the
alleged qualifying circumstance of evident premeditation, treachery and
superior strength.  The prosecution
however, has not successfully established the presence of the circumstance of
evident premeditation, for while it has been shown that the two accused were
seen at the side of the trail before the incident no further evidence was
presented to prove that they were there in pursuance of a plan to assault and
kill Antonio Cafino.  A qualifying
circumstance must be proven as convincingly as the crime itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the circumstance of treachery has not been clearly shown to
be present although there is testimony from two prosecution eyewitnesses that
Antonio Cafino was hacked by accused Wilfredo Sarense at the back “below the
right shoulder.” Such hacking, however, was executed after Antonio Cafino was
hacked by accused Dodoy Sarense and there was movement and changes of position
between them.  It may not be said then that
the hacking of Antonio Cafino at the back by Wilfredo Sarense was adopted and
deliberately sought to insure its unobstructed execution when no evidence was
presented to prove that it was so.  Likewise, like any qualifying circumstance, treachery must be proven as
fully and as convincingly as the crime itself and may not simply be inferred
from presumptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is however, present in the commission of the crime the
qualifying circumstance of abuse of superior strength as shown by the fact that
the two accused, who were both armed with bolos, were simultaneously hacking
Antonio Cafino, inflicting on him nine (9) wounds, five of which were fatal,
thus giving Antonio no quarters and affording him no chance to fight back.  After the incident Wilfredo Sarense came out
unscathed while Apolinario Sarense sustained only two minor injuries, one of
which was on his index finger and the other below his right shoulder which may
have been caused by one of Wilfredo's hacking blows according to witness
Jacinto Cafino considering that the two accused, according to him,
simultaneously delivered about 13 hacking blows, some of which missed their
marks.  The infliction alone of nine
wounds <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>Antonio Cafino
indicates the superior strength employed by the two accused on their victim and
which they took advantage of to ensure that they would not suffer any harm in
retaliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the two accused conspired in the killing of Antonio Cafino
is well shown by their concerted acts in simultaneously hacking their victim
with their bolos, hitting the latter on vital parts of his body, with a common
object and purpose of killing him, as Apolinario Sarense believed that the
deceased was the cause of the dislocation of his family and the transfer of his
residence from Jumao-as in Malungkay, Zamboanguita to Calangog, Bacong.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy has been convincingly proven; both accused are equally
liable for the death of Antonio Cafino.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is evidence to show that Apolinario Sarense surrendered to
the police authorities of Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental at dawn of January 23,
1988.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
None is presented, however, with respect to Wilfredo Sarense.  It would seem that Apolinario Sarense is
attempting to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>assume full
responsibility for the crime in order to save his son, Wilfredo.  The evidence, however, presented facts
contrary to his version of the incident in question and he cannot be allowed to
succeed in his attempt.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, there being no reversible error in the decision
appealed from, the same is hereby AFFIRMED with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span>modification that the penalty to be imposed upon Apolinario Sarense
