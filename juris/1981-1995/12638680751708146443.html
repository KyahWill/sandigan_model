				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
seeking the annulment of:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the order
dated January 23, 1976 of respondent Secretary Blas Ople, entitled IN RE:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES AGAINST DAVID P.
MACAYAYONG for Abandonment of post/Insubordina­tion, which dropped Atty.
Macayayong, Legal Officer III of the Bureau of Labor Standards, from the roster
of the Department of Labor; (b) the Resolution No. 351 dated April 26, 1977
issued by respondent Jacobo Clave sustaining the order of Secretary Ople; and
(c) the decision dated June 20, 1979 issued by respondent Clave sustaining his
own Resolution No. 351.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as summarized in Resolution No. 351 of the
Civil Service Commission which was quoted by the Office of the President, are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Petitioner Macayayong had been detailed with the various offices
in the Office of the President (the last one being the Board of Liquidators)
from 1968 up to the time he was dropped from the roster of the Department of
Labor effective January 31, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Undersecretary of Labor terminated the detail of the petitioner with the Malacanang
Complaint and Action <span style="">Unit </span>effective
September 26, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Chairman, Board
of Liquidators, Office of the President, requested extension of pe­titioner’s
detail with said office until after the cases he was handling are
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the request,
the Secretary of Labor in a telegram manifested that the detail of Atty.
Macayayong was not sanctioned by his Office, therefore, the recall order <span style="">still </span>stood with a warning that unless
he (Macayayong) reported to his home office within 72 hours from notice, he
would be dropped from the rolls of personnel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In obedience thereto, Macayayong reported to the Bureau of Labor
Standards on January 6, 1975 and rendered service therein up to March 11, 1975,
when he applied for a leave of absence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Subsequently, without the knowledge of the Department, Macayayong
was back in the Office of the President, detailed with the Public Information
Unit on the strength of a letter-request of Assistant Executive Sec­retary
Zamora dated April 30, 1975 and of a letter <span style="">of </span>the Deputy Executive Secretary authorizing said
assignment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary <span style="">of </span>Labor in a letter dated July 24,
1975, averred that Macayayong failed to inform him and clear with him the said
assignment and in view of the fact that the Department of Labor particularly
the Bureau of Labor Standards, is fully engaged in the implementation of the
Labor Code, the previous request to extend Macayayong’s detail was denied and
as such, should the latter fail to return to his Office within 5 days from
receipt of a copy of said letter, he would be replaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, the chief of the Public Information
Unit requested that the recall order be held in abeyance pending the
termination of the cases being handled by Macayayong.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On January <span style="">5 </span>and 19,
1976, the Secretary of Labor notified Macayayong that his servi­ces would be
terminated effective January 31, 1976 by reason of his failure to report back
to his Office which urgently needed his services.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on January 23, 1976, the Sec­retary
issued an order dropping Macayayong from the roster of the Department of Labor
for ‘Abandonment of Post.’ The order is an­chored on the alleged fact that
Macayayong blatantly defied repeated recall orders.” (Rollo, Annex “V”, pp.
75-76; Annex “Z”, pp. 94-95).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On February 12, 1976, petitioner appealed to the Civil Service Commission
from the order rendered by the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 26, 1976, the Civil Service Commission chairmanned by
respondent Clave rendered Resolution No. 351 affirming the appealed order of
respondent Ople.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 19, 1977, the petitioner filed another appeal with the
Office of the President from Resolution No. 351 of the Civil Service
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1979, after the lapse of almost two (2) years,
respondent Clave, as Presidential Assistant, affirmed his own appealed
resolution rendered in his role as Chairman of the Civil Service Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated February 13, 1980, the Court gave due
course to the petition and required both parties to submit their respective
memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the required memoranda w<span style="">ere </span>filed, the Court declared the case submitted for decision in
the resolution dated April 30, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution dated June 22, 1988, the Court required the
parties to MOVE IN THE PREMISES and to file proper manifestations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents’ manifestation alleging that they
are not aware of any supervening event which may have rendered this case moot
and academic was filed on August 12, 1988 which was noted in the Court’s
resolution dated August 29, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s manifestation was filed on August 30, 1988 and in
the resolution dated October 12, 1988, the Court required the respondents to
comment on the said manifestation by the peti­tioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents’ comment was filed on January 13,
1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether or not petitioner’s
summary dismissal is in violation of the due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that the order of summary dismissal on the
ground of “abandonment of post”, was rendered without observ­ing the due
process requirement of the law and in violation of his security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent alleged that petitioner was never
denied due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, he was sent
the necessary notifications and was given an ultimatum to report back to his
home office which he disregarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
may be considered as substan­tial compliance with the due process rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that he was denied due process because he was
not given enough time to obey said recall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He alleges that the January 5 and 19 letters sent to him were received
together with the order of the Secretary of Labor on January 30, 1976 (Friday),
which was the eve of the effectivity of his dis­missal on January 31,
1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he was not given the oppor­tunity
to be heard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner’s contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that before petitioner was
dropped from the roster of the Department of Labor, he was notified twice by
his home office to report back to work, on January 5 and on January 19,
1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the aforesaid notices, the
petitioner was urged to come back to his home office because his services were
badly needed, with a warning that in case he (petitioner) fails to report, he
would be dropped from the roster of the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that petitioner’s contentions as to his date of
receipt of notices were true, it is well settled that due process contemplates
freedom from arbitrariness and what is required is fairness or justice, the
substance rather than the form being paramount.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>An allegation based solely on the lack of opportunity to be heard
without notice does not <b><span style="">per se</span></b><span style=""> </span>merit un­conditional approval
(Superior Concrete Products, Inc. v. WCC, <span style="">82
</span>SCRA 270; 1978).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
In Re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Asoy, it is said that “No
violation of due process is committed even where no hearing was conducted but
the parties were given the chance to explain their side” (Richards vs. Asoy,
152 SCRA 45; 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, there is
no denial of due process where petitioner was afforded an opportunity to
present his case (Ong, Sr. v. Parel, 156 SCRA 768; 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the principle of due process seeks to
safeguard is not lack of previous notice but the denial of oppor­tunity to be
heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if a party had not been
given <span style="">prior notice </span>of a motion,
he cannot claim denial of due process if he was given the opportunity to file a
motion for reconsideration of the order which was issued pursuant to a motion
without prior notice to him (Pobre vs. Gonong, 148 SCRA 553; 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner was given ample opportunity to be
heard and to present his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as
previously stated, he appealed his case to the Civil Service Commission and
then to the Office of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
both appeals, he lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had ruled that a motion for reconsideration or appeal
is curative in character on the issue of alleged denial of due process by way
of lack of hearing of the case (Sampang vs. Inciong, 137 SCRA 56, 1985).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on the merits of the case, there is no question that the
right to dismiss or otherwise impose sanctions upon an employee for just and
valid cause, pertains in the first place to the employer, as well as the
authority to determine the existence of said cause in accordance with the norms
of due process (Foster Parents Plan, et. al. vs. Demetriou, 142 SCRA 505;
1986).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is Dismissed for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">SO ORDERED<span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></p>
